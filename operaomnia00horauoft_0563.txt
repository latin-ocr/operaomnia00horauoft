Pausias was a native of Sicyon, one of the
mom celebrated schools of art, where there
wan a collection of his pictures.
Many were sold hythe Sicyonian govern-
their debta, and most of thoee
one, pnnted with great boldness and skill,
and a snm-ifioe, was trans-
ported to Rome by Scaurus when he was

in the porticus of Cn. Pompeius. His pic-
tures however were chiefly small, ‘tabellae,'
and among the most celebrated was the por

96. Fulvi Rutubaeque Aut Pacideiani]
Thoee are all namoe of gladiators, as we
may gather stom the context. Pliny tells
us it was the practice, when shows of gla-
diators were exhibited, for the exhibitor to
aet forth a picture of the gamoe, to inform ⁷
the public, such aswe sce now of conjurors,
druis, and thelike; and thoeearewhat

roughly aa he daecriboe. “Pingi autem
gladiatoria munera atque in publico exponi
coepta a C. Terentio Lucano'’ (Plin. xxxv.
c. 7, 5 33). Cicero mentions repeatedly a
gladiator named Pacideianus, as one whom
Lucilius had seen at Capua matched with
one Aserninus or Aaeerninus. He quotoe
the following linae of Lucilius 2—-

“Non spurcus homo sed doctus et acer

unua

(DeOthen. Orat. ‹zvi- SeealsoTuac.
Disp. iv. 21, andEp. ad Qu. Fr. iii.4.)
Horace may have taken the name for any
gladiator in consequence of the celebrity
of this man. The MSS. and editions vary
between Placideiani and Pasideiani. Some
of the old editions bave ⁴ placide J ani! Fea
refers to an inscription in Gruter’s collec-
tion (p. 301), in which the name Placidianus

- occurs, and he adopts that orthography.

‘contento poplite ’ represents the attitude
of the gladiator-s. The Scholiasta raiae a
doubt upon the point, thinking the words

may apply to the spectator meediing him-
self on tip-toe to get a nearer view.

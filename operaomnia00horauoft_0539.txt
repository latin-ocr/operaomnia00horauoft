mcmbers of his family whom Nasica might
expect to be named ‘heredes' or to have
legacioe, he would simply findthat no notice
was taken of them. We need not suppose
with Jacobs (lect. Ven. p. 402) that the

have this form. Some have the Greek,
Penelopen. What Bentley ysays on this
subject (see Epod. xvii. 17, ιι.) admits of
exceptions, as all such mles will be found
to do when the mette requires it. Imme-

without making it more Latin), andin Epp.

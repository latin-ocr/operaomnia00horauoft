CARMEN IX.

This is nn elegunt trine (⁴⁶ an incompenble dislogne,” Buttmann mna it), showing the
prooess of reeondliation between two lovers, in which the desire for peeeo appears in the
midst οἰ poeoended intimes-enee, and mutual jeslousy is made the means of re-union. The
subject could hardly have been more delieutely handled. Whether the treennent of it is
original or not, it is impossible to say. It is just such s subject ss one might expect to
find among the erotic poetry of the Greeks. One of Butnmnn’s remarks with reference
to this ode is well worth quoting. “The ancients had the skill to construet such poems,
sothntenehspeechtellsusbywhomitisspokeng butwelettheeditors treet usall our
lives u schoolboys, end interline such dialoguoe nster the fashion of our plays with the
names. To their sedulity we are indebted for the alternation of the lyrieal name Lydia
with the mmo Horatius in this exquisite work of ως and yet, even in sn English poem,
we should be offended ut seeing Collins by the side of Phyllis.’' Such offenoe the offi-
dousness of editors has already obtmded upon the readers of that poet ς and the praefice,
which jusfly offends the good uste of this disoerning scholar, had probably its origin
among Horaoe’s very earliest transuibers. The objection to the praefice is, that, like
offic unnutlxorized interpoetations, it tukae away fmm the artistic character of Horaoe's
poenis, end substitutes for it a supposititium reelity ut vai-ianoe with the passionlaes tone
of the works. As works of skill they are very elegunt: as works of feeling they must
always rank low.

ARGUMENT.

while thou didst love me better then all the world, no prinoe was happy ss Ι.

while Lydia was deerat to thee or women, the name ofIlin was not so noble as mine.

Chloe the sweet singen· is my queen z for her 1 would glndly die.

calais lovae me and 1 love him : for him I would gladly die.

thtifthe oldlove were touniteusagain, if Chloe were oestoffand turnedfrom my
door, md 1 opened it to Lydia again?

'l'hough Calais is hnndsome, and thou art fickle and passionate as the stormyseu, 1 would
live and die with thee.

DoNEc gratus eram tibi

Nec quisquam potior brachia candidae
Cei-vici juvenis dabat,

Persarum vigui rege beatior.

old Pelignian witches (i. e. to teach me my

aud potent draught? But, though it be
quick and potam yet the death that awaits

“sufficias ad novos dolores et hborge per

ferendos et poenas.” ⁶ Iaboroe’ is th'o
word elsewhere used for the punishment of
Tantalus (C. ii. 13. 28), and 1 think it has
been properly restored to the text. Ascen-
sius has it, but noue 1 believe between him
and Bentley. ‘Infidus’ and ‘infidi’ both
have support from the MSS. But the
lauet hm the best, according to Torrentius,
Bentley, and Orelli. Fea's references 1
cannot follow, but he reads ⁴ infidus! Tbe
old editions have ⁸ infidus,' and Ι know 'of
none but Torrentius’ that has ‘infidi’ till
Bentley’s. As father aud son each earned
the epithet, it is not my to judge in this
conilict of authority to which of them it
should be given. Tine poets of the Augustam
age, in relating the punishment of Tantalus,
refer only to that legend accordingto which,
standing in the midst of water, with fruit-
trees over his head (⁸ benig-na dapoe '), he is
not able to resch either. The other story,
followed by Pindar and the Greek poets, of
a great stone suspended over his head and
ever threatening to fall on him, the Roman
poeta do not allude to. But Cicero does,
and only to that (de Pin. i. 183 Tuae-Disp.
iv. 16). In the Babarini Palace at Rome
there is a rilievo containing a very striking
group of the three suffer-ers, Ixion, Sisyphus,
and Tantalus, in which the last is repre-
sented with a stream of water pom-ing from
his hands, which are joined and raised to
his mouth. The expression of pain and
disappointment approaching to despair is
admirably represented, to judge by the eu-
graving given by Spence. In the same
group Sisyphus is represented as carrying a
huge stone on his shoulders up a steep
mountain, which seems to agree with Ovid’ s
expression: “Aeoliden saxum grave Sisy-
phon urget'’ (Met. xiii. 26). There' is how-

ever but one story about Sisyphus’ punish-

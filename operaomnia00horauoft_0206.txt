176 HORATII FLACGI

GARMEN XIV.
A.U.C. 729 οι· 730.

This ode has been animadverted upon pretty severely, and even rejected as spurious,
because unequal to the occasion it was written for. It may'not be one of Horace’s best.
But it was evidently only a private affair. It was composed at the close of the Canta-
brian war, A.tJ.c. 729, when Augustus' return was expected, or on his return the follow-
ing year. He was detained by illness at Tarracona. Franke gives, from Norisius, a frag-
ment of an inscription which makes it appear probable that Augustus recovered his health
and returned in the summer of 730, in which year C. Norbanus Flaccus was consul:

ARGUMENT.

Caesar is returning a conqueror from Spain, Ο ye people, he who but just went forth like
Hercules to the field. Let his chaste wife and sister go forth to offer sacrifice with the
matrons, while the young soldiers and their brides stand reverently by. Ι too willkeep

ointment, and my best old wine, and go bid Neaera come: if the churlish portm-
refuse thee, come away 3 Ι have no mind for strife, though I might not have borna as
much in the heyday of my youth. ” ·

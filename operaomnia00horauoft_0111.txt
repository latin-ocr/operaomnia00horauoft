CARMINUM Ι. 36. 81

Neu promptae modus amphorae,

Neu morem in Salium sit requies pedum,
Neu multi Damalis meri

Bassum Threicia vineat amystide,

Neu desint epulis rosae, 15

Neu vivax apium, neu breve lilium.
Omnes in Damalin putres
Deponent oculos, nec Damalis novo

Divelletur adultero

Lascivis hederis ambitiosior.

says that of the thirty-four years of their
intercourse the greater number had been

hlgpgt si calculus omnis hue et illuc
Diversus bicolorque digeratur
Vincet eandida turba nigriorem.''

And Catullus exclaims in joy at Loebia's
renirntohinu‘ *Ο Lucem candidiore ιιοιῑιιὶη
(cvii. ad Lesbiam). Horace only uses
v‘Orestia' (the adectiveof creta‚' ehalk, so
aliod m coming from Cimolus, a small
iahad near Crete), where Catullus and the
odim uae its equivalent‘ eandida! Grae-
vius adopted the notion of Harduin (on the
above passage of Pliny), who takes‘ Cressa
ποῦ’ to mean the sameas ‘notaFalerni'
(c.ii.3..8 S.i. lo. 24), ‘Cretanwinel
Bentley was not aware thathis friend had
patroniaed this interpretation, which he
satisfactorily disposes of by showing that
Cretan wine was nothing more than‘ pas-
sum) a sweet liqueur made of raisins.

12. Ne- morem in Salium] ‘Salium'
ia an adjective like ‘ Saliaris’ in the next
ode. Orelli muting between adjective
and substantive contradicts himself in his
notes in this plaoe and C. iv. 1.28, where it
oemrs again. See note.

13. multi Damalis mer-2⁶] Such is the
»⁹⁶¹¹’a¹,⁸.⁸’¹3¹.221³(⁵fi¹.{ ἒῐῗῑέὃέἷῒὲῒὲὲἷζ ἐξ

rightly interprete ‘ magnae pecnniae’ by

tions that Damalis was a name common
among freedwomen (Estre p. 481). Who
Bassus was, we mnnot tell without knowing

more of his friend Numida (see Introduc-
tion). Martial mentions a Bassus, who
according to his severe insinuation might
vie with Damalis (vi. 69):—

“ Non miror {¹⁰⁰⁶ potat aquam tua Bassa,

Miror quod Basm’ filia potat aquam, ’¹
where the name is pyrobabl fietitious· but
it may have been proverbial.y Thu, however.
it may have become from this verse of
Boraee. There ean be little doubt, however,
that Bassus was arealpersonandafriend
of the soldier whose return was to be eele- γ
brated. Damalis may be any body—a
woman like Lyde (C. ii. 11. 22), brought
intotheodetomakeupasoene.

14. Tlnre'ieia vincat amystide] ‘Amystis'
was a deep draught taken without drawing
breath or closing the lips (ἀ, μύειν). Aris-
tophanae uses the word (Acharn. 1229): —

tat πρός γ ἅκραΤΟν ἐγχέας ἅμυπῑν
έξὲλ adm,

and Euripides (cyclops, 416, sq.) :—

ὁ δ’ ἐκπλέως ἂν τῆς ἀναισχύντου βορᾶς

ἐδέξατ’ ἔσπασέν τ’ ἄμυστιν ἑλκύσας.

For Threicia see i. 27. 2.

17. patr es Dqtonent aculem] ⁴ Will fix
their languishing eyes! Persius uses the
word ‘ putres' in the same way :—

“ hunc alea decoquit: ille

In Venerem ffit putris, '²
or, as some MSS. read, ‘puniet’ 'rho
Scholiast Acron interprete it‘ ‘nimio potu
marcentes et libidine resolutos! ” Theocri-
tus expresses the word by τήκεσθαι (i. 90)=
καὶ τὺ δ ἐπεί κ’ ἐσορᾷς ‘hic παρθένος οἶα
γελῶντι Τάκεαι ὀφθαλμώς.

20. ambitiosior] This is the onlypas-
sage in which the word occurs in this sense,
the nearest to ‘ ambire' in its primitivo
meaning. See Foroell.

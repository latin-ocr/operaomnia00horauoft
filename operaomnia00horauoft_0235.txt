fromthe scene altogether. Idonotseethedifficultyof the ode thothasarresoedmost
offflesditors. The length os the digression is simply a way with Horace (as in the
storyofRegulus,C. iii. 5, and onypermnestra, iii. ll), and Pindar took the
some liberty with greater sreedom. It is a peculinrity which imitator-s of Horace will do
well ιο note, for if skilfully managed it would relieve the tameness of many anode which,
professing to he au imitation of this author, has little but his rhythm and a few of his
phnses to sustain the resemblance.

By similar arguments Propertius (ἰ. 8) detero Cynthia stom going to ses, and Ovid
Corinna (Am. ii. ll). 'l'he Scholiast on Homer (11. xii. ³07) says the story of Europa
was tested hy Bacchylides, whose poem has not come down to us, nor any part οἰ it, but
was probably, ις Orelli says, in Horaoe’s hands. The Scholiast's account of the story is
just that of the present ode. Ῑι would he difficult ιο find a more touching picture than

ported snrfrom the semrity of her home, and lest forlorn among strangers, knowing no tie

reprosch: her-fault had been giving way to a foolish impulse, but she seoe her crime Ι
through her feu-s, which magnify it greatly by pointing to its probable issue, so that she
looks upon heridle curiodty as nothing laes than madness (v. 36). There is also great
skill in the last stanm, in which we have, first, the derisive laughter with which Venus
nd her son (whose bow is now unstrung because it has done its work, the Scholiast says)
hruk in upon the unhappy girl3 then the imnicsl prophecy in which her own words are
used against her3 and, lastly, the serious consolation and congratulation with which they
mnounce her good fortune, and bid her n'se ιο ἰι. The pain arising from her oomplaint

ARGUMENT.

Let the wicked go on their way with evil omens. Ι do but pray for thee that the storin
may be aver-ted. Be happy go where thou wilt, and remember me, Galatea. Fear not
those idle omens: but see the rising sturm: 1 know the dangers it portends. May they

crossed the sea by night, but feared not till she stood on the shore of Crete. Then she
αἱαὶ out in anguish, ‘⁴ Alae! my father, a daughter’s name Ῑ have abandoned; love is
swallowed up in madness. What an exchange is here! Many deaths do 1 deserve to
die. Am 1 awake,or is it a dream? Wasitbettertocrossthesea than ιο gather young
flowers at home? Oh that 1 might avenge myself on that monster once too dearly
loved. Shame on me that Ι left my home ς shame that 1 delay to die. Let me
go naked among lions and perish by tigers, rather than waste away in a lingering death.
Vile girl, thy father tennts thee: why dost thou not die? Here thou mayest hang
by thy girdle, or dash thee on the rocks, or into the stormy waves, unless thou
wouldest yield thyself a barbarian’s slave. ’'-Then eume Venus md her son, and
hughed mischievously, and said, ‘¹ Cease thy wrath when the monster shall come back

CARMEN X.

This ode is said by the Scholiast Porphyrion to be taken from Alcaeus, and aooonffing
to h'im is a mere translation, for he commences his commentary by calling it “ Hym-
nus in Mercurium ab Alcaeo lyrico poetass’ He says the story of Apollo’s cows was
invented by Alcaeus, and his assertion is confirmed by Pausanias (vii. 20. 2) z βουσὶ
γὰρ χαίρειν μάλιστα Ἀπόλλωνα Ἀλκαῖός τε ἐδήλωσεν ἐν ὕμνῳ τῷ εἰς Ἑρμῆν, γράψας
ὡς ὁ Ἐρμῆς βοῦς ὑφέλοιτο τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος. The first line of a Sapphic ode of Alcaem
has been preserved, which seems to have been that which Horace imitated: Χαῖρε ‘vh-
λα’νας ὸ μέδεις, σὲ γάρ μοι (3 Bergk). The attributes and legende belonging ω Hermes.
the Greek divinity‚ are transferred to Mercurius the Latin, who was originally a different , ;
conception from Hermes. Compare the two in Smith’s Dict. Myth„ which willexplain ,
all the allusions' 111 this ode. Ovid (Fast. v. 663. sqq.) gives much the samo account of
Mercurius m his happy manner. He also mentions the story of the cows. His desa-ip·

ARGUMENT.

Mercmy, thou who in their infancy didst tame the human race by the gista of speech
and the palaestra, of thee will I sing, thou messenger of the gods, thou master of the
lyre and prince of thieves. Why, while Apollo was threatening thee for ntuling his
cows he turned and laughed to find his quiver was gone. By thee Priam pos-ed through

the Grecian camp (Il. xxiv. 334). Thou conductest souls to their last home, thou
favourite of gods above and gods below !

MEncmu facunde nepos Atlantis,
Qui feros cultus hominum recentum
Voce formasti catus et decorae'
More palaestrae,
Te canam magni J ovis et deorum 5
Nuntium curvaeque lyrae parentem,
Callidum quidquid ,placuit jocoso
Condere furto.

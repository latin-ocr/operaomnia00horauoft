opinion. The plural σάββατα is commonly
used by the writers of the New Testament
for the sabbath day. The joke, however,
would have little point if it were not the
fact that there were at Rome superstitious
people, especially women and persons of
nei-vous habit and of the lower orders (see
S. ii. 3. 291, n.), who, being ready to be
influenced by any superstition, were pre-
pared to be frightened at the statements of
the Jews, who were zealous' ιιι making prose-
lytes (see S. 4. 143), and no doubt terrified
some by their representation of the curses
denouneed upon the transgressors of the
sabbath. Ovid, advising a man how to get
out of love, bids him above all things go
away from his mistress, and let nothing
stop him (Rem. Am. 219):

‘⁴ Nec pluvias vites nec te peregrina mo-

rentur
Sabbata, nec damnis Allia nota suis.”

72. Huncine solem Tam niqrum eur-
rexe] ‘Huncine' is compounded of the
pronoun, the demonstrative enclitic ‘ce’
(for ⁴ ecee,’ ⁴ behold '), and the interrogative
enclitic ‘ne' (Key’s L. G. 293). As to
⁴ surrexe,' see S. i. 5. 79; and Terence (Ad.
iv. 2. 22), “Non tu eum rus hinc modo
Produxe aibas? ''

74. Casu venit obvius illi Adversarius]
Whether this ¹ adversarius' is the same
person who was plaintiff in the action
above referred to has been questioned.
The point turns on the expression ⁴ rapit in
jus ’ (v. 77). ‘ Iu jus vocare ' is a technical
expression having reference to the first
step in a civil action when both parties ap-
peared before the praetor or other magis-
tratus having ‘jurisdictio,’ with the view of
fixing a day for the commeneement of the
trial. On this occasion the ⁴ vadimonium '
above described was entered into. This
first step was usually avoided by the partios
arranging the day between themselves, and
giving each other security for their attend-
ance. But when the defendant was obsti-
nate and ill- disposed‚ the⁴ in jus vocatio'
was resorted to. ίἸιι Jus vocare, ’,therefore
being the first step, could not follow upon
the neglect of the vadimonium’ by Horace’s

companium and the ⁴ adversarius' in this
case cannot be the plaintiff in the other, un-
less Horace is speaking loosely. But as this
uuprincipled fellow may very probably luva
had plenty of creditor-s, there is no reason
why Horaee' s deliverer should not be a new
one seut by Apollo to his rescae. 11· we
are to suppose the two to be identical, then
Horace means that the plaintiff, not satisfied
with the forfeit of the‘ vadimoniumss would
go through with the action, and hurried his
adversary off to the praetor, as he might do
insuchacase.1f thatbe so, Horaoeuses
a legal term in an unusual way, from want
of accurate knowledge of the of
the courts. ΤΙιε above will be found
better stated in Mr. Long's note referred to

on v: 36, where the inconsistency between ι

Orelli’s views and his quotations from
Plautus is also shown.

76. Licet antestari Τ] This word signifies
the calling a bystander to witness that there
was nothing illegal in the conduct of the
plaintiff in such a case as the above, and that
the defendant had resisted, and that force
was necessary. The processwas bytouching
the ear of the person whose testimony was
asked, who could not be compelled to be a
witness, but after he had consented he wa
bound to appear and give evidence if re-
quired. Horace was only too glad to help
in the forcible removal of his persecutum·¹
and gave his ear with all readiness. The
parties begin to wrangle: a uowd of idlers
of oourse forms round them, and Horace
makes his escape. The meaning of ¹ in jus
vocatio ' and ⁴ antestari ’ is sufficiently
marked in a passage of Plautus (Pers. iv.
‘⁴ S. Age ambula in jus, leno. D. Quid me

. . >

S. lilliuisigffiraetorem dicam. D. Sed

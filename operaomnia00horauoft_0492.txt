HORATII FLACCI

games, we say he is mad. Is not he as mad who whines after a hai-lot? And if so, isit
not better to follow Polemo’s example, to listen to the voice of wisdom, and to east away

the ensigns of lust and repent?

The child who refuses the fruit you offer him, and if

he cannot get it longs to have it, only represents the caprices of lovers squabbling and
making it up again. Is not the man prattling and playing lovers’ games with his mis-
tress as mad as the dotard we have mentioned? to say nothing of the bloodshed lust
often leads to, as in the case of Marius the other day, who ’ murdered his mistress and

destroyed himself.

(v. 281.) “There was once a libertinus who went about from shrine to shrine praying the

gods to give him immortality.

A certain mother vowed if her son recovered from his

fever he should stand up to his chin in the Tiber. Th0 boy recovered, the vow was
performed, and the fever came back. Now what was their madness ?—Superstition.’'
(v. 296.) Thus has Stertinius armed me against all the world. If any one says 1 am

mad, I can tell him to look at home.

Friend, success attend you. Pray tell me what is my particular madness. Ῑ am not

awai-e that I am otherwise than sane.

Did Pentheus' mother think herself mad even when she carried the head of her poor

slaughtered son ? ,
Well I admit 1 am mad. But tell me how.

Why you are aping Maecenas and building beyond your means, as the dwarf might ape
the giant, or as the frog in the fable aped the bull. 'rhen you write verses. Ilay

nothing of your horrible temper-
No more of that!

—or of your living beyond your income— ⁴

Mind your own business, Damasippus.
—and your thousand mad amours.

Ο spare me, I pray thee, great madman, for thou art mightier than me.

“ Sic raro scribis, ut toto non quater anno

Nil dignum sermone canas.

l. Sic raro acribia] The MSS. and
editions are nearly all in favour of ‘ scribis,'
notwithstanding the metre. The Blandinian
MSS„ which Cruquius follows, had ¹ si ' for
‘'sic! Bentley, followed by Cunningham
and Sanadon, edits ‘ si raro scribes,’ and
makes ⁴ quid fiet ?' (v. 4) the interrogative
following this hypothetical clause. The
common reading appears to be the simplest
and best.

2. Membranam poema] Horace speaks
of parchment only twice (A. P. 389),
‘ charta‚' which means the Egyptian pa-
pyrus, being his usual equivalent for a
book. From the thin coats of the pa-
pyrus the name ‘ liber' was derived, and
parchment was less generally used in Ho-
race’s day than the papyrus; though the
word ‘membrana ’ is here used with suffi-
cient familiarity to show that that material
was also commonly employed. ⁴ Retexens '

sion for putting the pieces of the passyrus
together; for the manner of doing which
see Dict. Ant„ art. ⁴ Liber.' ‘Betexere
scripta' therefore means to take to pbces
or tear up what is written, or to take out
leaves and substitute others with ,different
writing upon them. Some of the inter-
preters not wisely refer the metaphor to
Penelope and her web.

3. vini somnique beniqnuc] This For-
cellini notices as a Greek construction:
‘ freely indulging in wine and sleep! ¹ Dig-
num sermone' means worthy of being
talked about.

4. At ipsi-r Saturnalibus] The old edi-
tions, and all till Bentley, together with
most of the MSS„ have ‘ab ;’ but the
eldest of the Blandinians had ‘at,’ which
Bentley has restored to the text. Horace’s

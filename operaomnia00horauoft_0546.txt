HORATII FLACGI

Hercule !' si quod adest gratum juvat, hac prece te oro:
Pingue pecus domino facias et cetera praeter

Ingenium, utque soles custos mihi maximus adsis.

Ergo ubi me in montes et in arcem ex urbe removi,
Quid prius illustrem satiris musaque pedestri?
Nec mala me ambitio perdit nec plumbeus Auster

and was in no way connected historically
with the Romans, he was held by them in
high esteem. He had a temple in the
north part of the city near that of Venus
Ery cina, and not far from the Porta Col-
lina (Livy xxvi. 10). We read in Plutarch
of Sulla and Crassus dedicating a tenth of
their whole fortune to Hercules, and feast-
ing the people magnificently ιιι his honour.
(Sulla, c. 35; Crassus, c. 2. 12.) He was
associated with Mercury in various ways;
as the god of gain, which we find here and
in the offerings above mentioned, which
were of frequent occurrence; as the god
of ways and of boundaries, ‘vialis' and
‘ terminalis 3’ and likewise as presiding over
the ‘palaestra' There are representations
of the two gods in one, of which a specimen
is given in Agostini’ s collection from a gem
(No 109), and he mentions having seen
others on rings that had been worn by
‘fathletae and many statues in marble.
ΤΙιθ combined form is called Ἑρμηρακλῆς
by Athenaeus, and it appears to have been
very common. The notion seems to be
that of combining strength and cunning.

13. quod eet] See C. iii. 29. 32: “ quod
adest memento Componere aequus.” It is
an adaptation of ,the Greek τὸ παρόν.
⁶ Gratum juvat ' may either mean ‘ satisfies
me, for I am gratefuL' or ‘is welcome and
satisfies me.’ Orelli prefers the latter. He
may be right, but not without doubt.

16. in montes et in arcem] See C. iii.
4. 21: “Vester‚ Camenae, vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos.’⁷ By ‘arcem' he means
his house on the Sabine hills. (See C. ii.

17.)Quid prius illustrem] ‘What sub-
ject should I take in preference to this ς’
that is, the country to which he retires.
On‘ pedoetfi’ see C.' ιι. 12. 9, ιι.

18.p plumbeus Auster] ΤΙιθ south -wind
is so called as depressing the energies and
spirits. The epithet is very expressive,

‘the leaden south! Compare C. ii. 14. 15.

“Frustra per Auctumnos nocentem
Corporibus metuemus Austrum;'
and C. iii. 23. 8: “Pomifero grave tempus
anno· ‚ '’ and Epp.' 1. 7. 5:

dum fieus prima calorque
Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris.”

 

Juvenal also speaks thus ε

J am letifero cedente pruinis
Auctumno jam quartanam sperantibus
aegris.’' (S. iv. 56.)

And—

 

“ — Jam deficientibus Austris,
Spes vitae cum sole redit.” (S. xii. 69.)

And again-—
“ Grande sonat metuique jubet'sepoembrin

et Austri
(S. vi. 517.)

Adventum.”
Auster and Notus are not distinguished by
the poets. They are invariably represented
as bringing heavy rains- “quid cogitet
humidus Auster'' (Georg. i. 462). Ovid
hasta representation, which seems plainlyto
have been taken from a picture (Met. i.

264, sqq.):

-- Madidis Notus evolat aus, ’
Terribilem picea tectus caligine vultum.
Barba gravis nimbis3 canisfluit unda oa-
Ι<“ι·οιι1;1ιι118 sedent nebulae: rorant pennaeque

Statius refers to these‘ sinus' οι· folda ot·
hiznggrments, it would seem from another
p “ —- sed plurimus Auster
Inglomerat noctem, et tengbrosa volumina

Deffflffiffihe imbres. '' (Theb. i. 350.)

We do not know what we have lost in tho
paintings of the ancients tiu we read these
fine descriptions. Probably following the
same guidance, Statius speaks of“ pallens
Auctumnus” (Silv. ii. 1. 217). Horace had
a different picture in view perhaps when he
wrote‘ ‘decorum mitibus pomis caput Auc-
tumnus arvis extulit” (Epod. ii. 17). Ιιι
one of Agostini’ s gems (No. 147) he is re-

presented as quite a youth with fresh strong

He was therefore represented under various

aspects.

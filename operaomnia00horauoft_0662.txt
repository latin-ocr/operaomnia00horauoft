HORATII FLAOGI

Et nos quod cures proprium fecisse loquamur. 5
Si te grata quies et primam somnus in horam “
Delectat, si te pulvis strepitusque rotarum,

Si laedit caupona, Ferentinum ire jubebo;

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia solis,

Nec vixit male qui natus moriensque fefellit*

10

Si prodesse tuis pauloque benignius ipsum
Te tractare voles, accedes siccus ad unctum.
“ Si pranderet olus patienter regibus uti
Nollet Aristippus.” “ Si sciret regibus uti

Fastidiret olus qui me notat.”

Utrius horum 1⁵

Verba probes et facta doce, vel junior audi
Cur sit Aristippi potior sententia ; namque
Mordacem Cynicum sic eludebat, ut aiunt:

Kuinoel on the first of those passages) has
οὔτε δὲ ὁ ἄτεχνος τὸν ἄτεχνον διδάσκειν
δύναται, ὡς οὐδὲ ὁ τυφλὸς τὸν τυφλόν.
Porphyrion quotes another proverb to the
same effect ε “ Sus Minervam docet.''

8. Ferentinum] This was a municipium
on the Via Latina, about forty-six miles
from Rome, in the country of the Hernici,
not, as Torrentius and others say, of Etruria,
which was a different place. It still retains
its name Ferentino. It appears not to have
been much frequented, and Horace recom-
mends his friend to go there, if the object
of his wishes is a quiet life, which he says
is not without its recommendations.

10. moriensque fefellit] Horace uses
‘ fallere ' as the Greeks used λανθάνειν (see
C. iii. 16. 32, n.). But it is only used ab·
solutely here and in the next Epistle (v.
103), “ secretum iter et fallentis semita
vitae.'' Livy uses it without a substantive
after it (xxii. 33) ε “ Speculator Carthagini-
ensium qui per ,biennium fefellerat Romae
deprehensus.’' Horace takes his expression
from the Greek proverb λάθε βιώσας,
which appears to have been used by the
Epicureans and Cyrenaics. Plutarch op-
poses the rule in a treatise of which the
title is εἰ καλῶς εἴρηται τὸ λάθε βιώσας.
Erasmus quotes Ovid (Trist. iii. 4. 25) 2

⁴‘ Crede mihi bene qui latuit, bene vixit, et
Foilthliiam debet quisque manere suam.’'

12. siccus ad unctum] This Comm.
Cruq. explains: “ pauper et tenuis ad opu-
lentum et locupletem.” So Forcellini ex-
plains ‘ siccus,’ but he does not give any
other examples of this sense. There is an

expression in Theocritus which is obscure,
but bears some likeness to this (Id. 1. 51),
where a fox is represented as having a design
upon a boy’s breakfast :—
a' δ’ ἐπὶ πήραν
πάντα δόλον τεύχοισα τὸ παιδίον οὐ πρὶν
ανησειν
φατὶ, πρὶν ἢ ’νιίριστον ἐπὶ ξηροῖσι καθ-
ι’ξῃι
which means that the fox is resolved not to
go away till he has left the boy without his
breakfast3 and ἐπὶ ξηροῖσι, ‘ on dry meat,'
means no meat at all. So ⁴ siccus ¹ means
one who cannot command a dinner, or can
only command a dry one. The Cynies were
called ξηρόφαγοι from their abstinenoe, and
ξηροφαγὶιι among the early Christians was
a fast. ⁴

13. Si pranderet olus patienter] Dio-
genes Laert. (i. 68) relates that Aristippus
one day was passing Diogenes, the Cynic,
while he was washing some vegetables for
his dinner, and he was accosted thus: εἰ
ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἂν τυράν-
νων αὐλὰς ἐθεράπευες, alluding to his hav· ·
ing been the guest of Dionysius of Syracuse.
The answer of Aristippus was : καὶ σύ,
εἴπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθριιίποις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν
λάχανα ἔπλυνες.

15. qui me notat] ⁴ Notare ' is used in
a bad sense (see S. i. 6. 20, n.).

18. Mor-dacem Cynicum] The character
of Diogenes is proverbial, and the stories
that are told of him are too well known to
require repetition. He was like his master
Antisthenes in character, and adopted his
views with a zeal that knew no discretiong
so that the popular notion of a Cynic is

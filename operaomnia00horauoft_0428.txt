HORATII FLAOOI

Objiciet vere quisquam mihi, purus et insons

(Ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis;

Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni
Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,

Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque laem-tn,

Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aera :

Scholiasts whose commentary accompany
his own have ‘ ac,' though Bentley says in
an older copy of Acron printed at Venice
in 1490, and in a MS. of his commentary
in the library of the Royal Society, ‘ aut’
appears. It is with very little doubt the
true reading, for Horace repeatedly intro-
duces ‘ aut ' after ‘ neque‚’ twice repeated.
Other passages are C. iii. 23. 5; S. i. 9. 31 ;
ii. 1. 15, 2. 22. The construction with ‘ nec '
and ‘ et ’ is of the same kind, and has been
noticed before.

71. macro pauper ayello] This small
farm of his father’s at Venusia was confis-
cated during the time he was with the army
of Brutus and Cassius.

72. Noluit in Flavi ludum] His father,
who knew the value of a good education,
and formed a right estimare of Horace’s
abilities, would not send him to a small
provincial school kept by one Flavius, where
nothing but arithmetic was taught, but
took him for his education to Rome, where,
though Horace complains that the teaching
lay chiefly 111 figures and the pursuits of a
practical life (Epp. ii. l. 103, sqq„ A. P.
325, sqq. ), there were means os acquiring a
knowledge of literature and the arts for
those who chose to take advantage of them.
Ovid in like manner was sent from Sulmo,
his native town, to Rome. (Trist. iv. 10.
16.) ⁴ Magni,' ‘ magnis,’ may mean ‘ big‚'
‘ coarse,’ contemptuously, as Persius says
(S. v. 189, sqq.):

‘⁴ Dixeris haec inter varicosos centuriones3
Continuo crassum ridet Vulfenius ingens
Et centum Graecos curto centusse licetur?

or they may mean ‘ important,’ as centurions
and their sons might bein a small municipal
town.

74. Laevo waperaei loculos] This verse
is repeated in Epp. i. l. 56. Each boy
went to school with a bag, in which he
carried his books and pens, and perhaps his

‘calculi’ or pebbles used' 111 calculation. The
manner of using them is conjecturally ex-
plained 111 Smith' s Dict. Ant„ art. ’.Αδασυε’

‘'Tabulam is explained by Cruquius’ Scho-

75

liast as signifying the ‘abacus' or bom-d
on which the ‘calculi’ were arranged and
the sums performed. Acron explains it
differently as “buxum in quo mediantur
scriberess' the wooden tablet covered with
wax, for waiting upon, which is the better
explanation. These country scheol-boys
did for themselves what at Rome was done
for boys of good birth by slaves ‘capsarii'

(Sueton. Claud. 35)

“Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse
Minervam,
Quem sequitur custos angustae vernul-
capsae.’' (Juv. x. 116, sq.)

75. Ibant octonis] This verse has caused
a good deal of difficulty to the commeantem.
In the first place, the meaning of ‘octenis
Idibus ’ is not clear. The Scholiasta say
that ‘ octonis ⁷ is transferred by hypallage to
‘Idibus‚' and that the snm these boys
paid their teacher was eight asses a mouth,
payable on the Ides. Landinns supposes
the money was paid en the eighth day
before the Ides of every mouth (visuh
would be the day after the Neues, ..11.
ooeavum Idus), or once a year on the ue·
of every eighth month- Doering calb
‘octonis' an “epitheton ornans,’' because
there were eight days between the Noue-
and Ides. So Orelli and many others
understand the word, supposing ‘aera' to
be the master's stipend, and this to be pnid
on the Ides of every month, or as efflet-s
say on any one of the days between tho
Nones and Ides. Another in
hasbeengivenby C..F Her-mmmmm!
adopted by Dillenbr. and Estre. ''l'hny
suppose that ‘octonis mensibus ’ means on
the Ides of eight months in the year, the
four summer months from the Ides of June
to the Ides of October being kept as holi-
days. They rely upon an epigram of
Martial (x. 62):

“Ludi magister, parce simplici turbae:
Sic te frequentes audiant capillati,
Et delicatae diligat chorus mensae,
Nec calculator nec notarius velox

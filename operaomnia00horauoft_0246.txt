the goddess. With a Roman this was equi-
valent to saying for ever.
10. Dicar qua violens· obstrepit Aufidus]
‘ Violens' is not a common form of ‘vio-
lentus.' It occurs again Epp. i. 10. 37, and
in Persius (Sat. v. 171), “nunc ferus et vio-
lens.’' The editors try to get from these
words a meaning I do not see how they will
bear, as if Horace meant to say, as he says
elsewhere, “Ego, longe sonantem natus ad
Aufidum, 'dicax-fi The words of Acron which
Orelli quotes are ambiguousff ‘Dicar prin-
segetem&erexissent
to mean, not ‘ ibi natus qua,' as Orelli says,
but ‘ ad modos Italiae qua‚' and that may
be Horace’s meaning. But the order of the
words rather favours that I have given in
the Argument. Horace says, in the former
verses, that he has wrought a work for all
time, and here he seems, according to the
plain interpretation of the words, to take
pleasure in the thought that he shall be re-
membered iu connexion with his native
p.lace But if this interpretation be ob-
jecoed to on the ground that Horace never
appeared to take any great interest in his
birth· place (though the references' m C. iii.
4. 9, iv. 9. 2, andhis address tothe foun-
tain of Bandiisia show he had not foi-got.
ten it), either we must suppose him to mean
Italy in general, for which Daunia stands in
C. iv. 5. 27), or the words must be trans-
laoed thus: ‘ It shall be said that I who
in that place where the Aufidus roars, and
where Daunus, poor in streams, ruled over
his rustic people, from a man of low degree
became great, was the first to adapt the
Aeolian verse to Italian measures.' ‘Ob-
strepere’ is used absolutely again Epod. ii.

27. See Forcell. Apulia was not well

watered.

1 2. Reqnam‘t] This word, though itis used
in the passive voice (see last ode, v. 27)
here only has a noun aster it. Horace gives
it the genitive in imitation of ἄρχειν. He
wrote with his mind full of Greek consu-uc-
tions and words, and took the liberty of
using them very freely. Forcellini does not
notice this passage, and therefore it may be
presumed he only knew of the reading
⁴ regnator,’ which appears to have been the
reading of Acron, though it is not certain.
Porphyrion (who says there was a river
Daunus, which there was not) writes ex-
pressly “ adnotanda elocutio per genitivum
figurata est.” All Lambinus’ MSS„ several
of Bentley’s and Cruquius' (but not the
Blandinians), and many others, including
two of Orelli's later Berne, and nearly all
the editions till Lambinus, had ‘ regnator)
But ‘regnavit' is in the oldest Berne and
Blandinian, and several more mentioned by
Jani ; a verb also is wanted, and ‘regnavit'
is not likely to have been invented by the
transcribers in so unusual a construction.
‘ Pauper' takes a genitive in S. i. 1. 793
ii. 3. 142.

ea· humili poteram] This Bentley and
some others (Sivry, Meinecke) appyly to
Daunus, because he was a private person,
and from that condition became king of
Apulia. But this makes the words a mere
incumbi-unce without meming. Bentley
never can believe that so humble a man
would boast so largely. Ι do not know
what the meaning of the ode is, if a proud
and legitimate self-oomplaeency be not seen
in every part of it. Horace uses the ex—
pression ‘potentium vatum' in the eighth
ode of the next book (v. 26).
sidered Alcaeus and Sappho as his chief
models in lyric poetry, which he sums up
in the formula ‘ Aeolium carmen' here and
in C. iv. 3. 12. ‘Delphica lauro' is the

The punctuation and construetion of
this passage have been a subjectos much
diacusdon, as is well known. Aser
much consideration Ι have adop ted the
solution of the difficulty first suggested.
1 believe, by Rutgersius, and have put a
full-top κῆαι-4 nobilis? Graevius took the
anna view. For his strictures therefore
uponffiio reading Bentley lus an account
to noue with his friend, whose opinion he
probably did not know, for he does not
mention him. His objections are that
⁴ palma’ cannot be separated from ⁸ evehit'
without violence to the construction, which

jadioed by the habit ofJo mmgthe two

‘evehit' munotbeusedimpersonally, which

iuouowulaaguage we may say: “Itex

hy'shstobjectz'ouisthe worst of all: ‘⁴ How
eanamanbeaaidtobeexalted to Heaven

the mad was so easy.” If Bentley had
written his notes in English, the greater
part os them would only have raised a smile-
'l'his argument is a fair specimen of his
nitidem. He settles the question by
ehauging ⁸ evehit' into ‘ evehere‚' which he
makes dependent on ⁴ nobilis ς’ whereby he
thinkstogetridofthedifficulty of making
‘hunc’ aud ‘ illum' to depend on ‘ juvat.²
But even with this unauthorized correction
(which Orelli describes sufficiently when he
says ‘⁶ nemo recepit”), that construction is
harah, as any body willseewhotries

ᾖ* ab. But it is the one generally received

now, though‘ evehit' isretained. Mr. Tate

therecouldbeno reasouwhythemanwho
had risen to the highest honours and wealth

nos’ to bein apposition with ⁸ Deos,' quote
ovid, Ep. ex Ponto i. 9. 35, sq. ε

“Nam tua. ιιοιι alio coluit penetralia ritu

Terrarum dominos quam colis ipse Deos.''
Others apply these words to the competitors,
because they were usually kings or nobles:
others render ‘exalte them tothegodsas
lords of the world,’ i. e. ¹ as if they were!
Ι believe 1 have stated all the opinions of
any weight upon this passage. The render
will judge whether the reading 1 have fol-
lowed does not give the simplest solution of
the difficulty. Bentley is very ably refuta
by Cunning ham, Animadv. c. 15.

8. terqengninu] This refers to the three
curule es, those of the aedile,
praetor, and consul. Tho ugh the quaestor-
ship was usually the first step in the line of
promotion‚ it is not included, because it was
not a curule office. Not seeing that ‘ ter·
geminus' here signifies no more than ‘tri-
ple1,' some have supposed the quaestorship,
the tribuneship, andoensorshipto bein-
duded. But‘ geminus’ is used in this
combination with cardinal numbers fre·
quently. So Virgil (Aen. vi. 287) calls Bri-
areus ‘cemtumgeminuffi¹ and Catullus (xi.
7) the Nile‘ septemgeminus,' and Luci-et.
(v. 28) speaks of‘ ‘tripectora tergemini—-
Geryonai‚''andthe most unequivooel instance
of this uselof the word occurs in Paulus (Dig.
50. 16. 137) 2 ‘⁴ Ter enixa videtur etiam
quae trigeminos pepererit,'' which passage
bas been pointed out to me by Mr. Long.
“ Tollere honoribus ” is not, as some take
it, ‘⁴ tollere ad honores :'' ‘ honoribus' is tho
ablative case, as (C. i. 2l): ‘¹ Vos Tempe to-
tidem tollite laudibus.'’ Sall. Jug. 49: “ ut
iiiiii-1¹²3? ‘²⁰³⁴‘ ‹iiaffiffi‘ffieifflffis
ficatu et curuli aedilitate—M Agrippam
geminatis consulatibus extulit.”

Ger-tat -tollere] The poets, following the
Greek idiom, use for convenience and con-
ciseness this construction of the infinitive
with verbs which in prose would require‘ ut '
with the subjunctive, or a supine, or ‘'ad
with a g,erund οι· some other construetipn.

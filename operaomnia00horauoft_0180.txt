150 HORATII FLAOGI

Visam Britannos hospitibus feros
Et laetum equino sanguine Concanum,
Visam pharetratos Gelonos 35
Et Scythicum inviolatus amnem,
Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
Fessas cohortes addidit oppidis,
Finire quaerentem labores
Pierio recreatis antro. 40

for the Tuscan Sea is an unusual limitation.
It must not be confounded with Mare Sicu-
lum. Palinurus was on the western coast
of Lucania. It retains its name as capo di
Palinuro.

31. urentes] The MSS. are divided be-
tween this and ‘ arentes.' Acron read
‘urentes,’ as it appears. Four of Orelli’ s
best MSS., with the Leiden of the tenth
century, have the same. He prefers it as
less otiose, and because all sands are dry,
but all do not burn as the Syrian beach
doeS. There is not much in this argument.
The participle of a transitive verb is not
commonly used as an epithet by Horace;
and if ‘ urentes' is neuter, it is not less idle
than ‘ arentes,’ which Bentley, Lambinus,
and Cruquius prefer. Authority seems to
be more in favour of ‘ urentes,' but on their
own merits it would be hard to decide be-
tween the two words. ‘Litoris Assyrii,’
Orelli says, may mean either the deserts
east of Syria, in which Palmyra is situated,
or the Syrian coast. ‘ Litoris ’ can hardly
mean any thing but the latter. See note on
C. ii. ll. 16.

33. Visam Britannos]
had a bad name. St. Jerome says he saw
a tribe in Gaul, the Ancon, of Brit-ish origin,
eating human flesh (Orelli’s note). The
stories of their human sacrifices are too
authentic to be doubted. See Tacitus (Ann.
xiv. 30), where he says of them, “ cruore
captivo adolere aras et hominum fibris con-
sulere deos fas habebant.'' Vix-gil (Georg.
iii. 463) relates of the Geloni that they eat
cheese dipped in horse’s blood. Whether
the Concani, who were a Cantabrian tribe,
did the same is doubtful. Horace perhaps
got his idea from Virgil, and Silius copied
Horace (iii. 360) 2-—

“ Nec qui Massageten monstrans feritate
parentem

Cornipedis fusa satiaris, Concane, vena.''

38. addidit] The MSS. appear to be
almost equally divided between this reading
and two others, ‘abdidit' and ‘reddidit ς’
and Bentley, with Fea and Meinecke, prefer

the last. In the year ΛΑΜ). 729, after the
conquest of the Salassi, a people of the
Gaulish Alps (Livy, Epit. 135. Dion Cass.
53. 25), Augustus assigned their territory
to some of the praetorian troops, and there
they built Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), and
about the same time there were assigned to
others lands in Lusitania, on which they

built Augu sta Emerita (Mel-ida). ‘Red-
didit' may be right, but ‘addidit' is a
word used in a like case by Tacitus (Ann.
xiii. 3:l) “Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria
additis veteranis firmatae sunt.''1t also
comes nearer to ‘abdidit,’ which is tho
reading of all the Scholiasta, who explain it
of the soldiers being sent to winter-quartem.
I have ‘no faith in this reading, and believe
it to be a corruption of ‘ addidit! Dillenbr.
thinks‘ abdidit’ much the best: “mirifice
conjunctus cum finiendis veteranorum mili-

tum laboribus. ” The truth lies, in my opi-

nion, between‘ reddidit' and‘ addidit? and
I have given my reason for preferring the
latter with Orelli. Lambinus conjectures
⁴ fessus ' for ⁴ fessas,' and Bentley ia much
pleased with the alteration but does not
alopt it.

40. Pierio recreatis antro. ] Suetonius,
in his life of Augustus (84, 85), relatos that’
he followed liter-ary pursuits withgrea tzed,
and dabbled in poetry. He could not have
had much time for such pin-suits when thie
ode was written, but he may have said
enough to let it be seen that he desired
leisure to follow them.

41. Vos lene consilium] The penulti- '

mate vowel coalesces with the next, as iu
‘principium' (iii. 6. 6). ‘Alfenius’ (S. i.
3. 130). ‘Nasidieni’ (S. ii. 8. l). SoVirgil
says (Aen. i. 73): “Connfibio' jungam sta-
bili.'’ Orelli applies this unneoessuily to
Augustus.1t appears to be no more than
a general commendation of the Muses.‘ Ye
give peaceful counsel and rejoice imgiving
it, because ye are gentle (almae)‚' is the
meaning of the words.

43. Titanas immanemque turmam] There
is no necessity for andei-standing ⁴ turmam'

Tu mihi qui imperitas alii servis miser atque

Duceris ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.

Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens sibi qui imperiosus,
Quem neque pauperies neque mors neque vincula terrent,

Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores

Fortis, et in se ipso totus, teres, atque rotundus,

Greeks oelled νευρόσπαστον). Τ119 ancients
oerried their mechanical skill in the con-
struction of automaton figures as far, and
perhaps farther, than it has been carried
since. A celebrated instance is that of
Claudius' sham-fight in the Lacus Fucinus,
during which a figure of Triton in silver

, rose up from the lake and blew a blast upon

a trumpet (Sueten. Vit. Claudii, c. 21).
Artists in this line were common among
the Greeks, and were called νευρόσπασται,
αὐτοματουργοί. 11 appears from Herodo-
tus (ii. 48) that ἀγάλματα νευρόσπαστα,
as he calls them, were 111 1189 among the
Egyptians. The instance he gives is very
filthy. Plato (de Legg. lib. i. p. 644) speaks
of man 's passions as Davus does· . τόδε δὲ
ἴσμεν, ὅτι ταῦτα τὰ πάθη ἐν ἡμῖν οἷον
νεῦρα ἦ μὴρινθοί τινες ἐνοῦσαι σπῶσί τε

writer uses this word with a case after it.
Pliny uses the genitive, Seneca 1119 dative,
after ‘imperiosus ' in the places quoted by
Forcellini.

18 repeated in v. 103 (where however see
note), and Epp. i. 1, 68. “Fortunae respon-
sare superbae.’' It seems to mean, to reply to
on equal tex-ms, and so to be a match for, and
to overcome. Τ119 construction of the adjec-
tive and infinitive is common in the Odes, but
not in the Satires or Epistles. See C. i. 1.
16, 11.

86. in ee ipso totus, teres, atque rotundum]
¹ In himself entire, smoothed, aud rounded,'
that is, perfect as a sphere, and, as the
next line explains, like a beautiful statue
whose are all in itself, which is per-
fectly finished and polished. This is else·
where expressed by ⁴ ad unguem factus

‘ He who has

homo’ (S. i. 5. 32, n.), the diffqenoe in
the mode of expression being, that hoee it
is meant there are no inequalities on the
surfaoe on which any thing 81 all can rest.
Τ119 other expression has been explained
111 its place. ‘Justus homo' signifies a
complete or perfect man. ‘ Inseipso totus’

parallelogram was also an illustration of the
ancients for a perfect man, taken from that
saying of Simonides in the fragment quoted
by Plato 111 his Protagoras (p. 339), and
thus restored by Hermann :—

Q. HORATII FLAcol

DE ARTE POETICA

LIBER.

Tuam-3 are no internal evidences, at all fit to be trusted, of the time when this poem
was written or of the persons to whom it is addressed. Tbey are three in number, a
father and two sons. Porphyrion and Comm. Cruq. say that the father is L. Calpurnius
Piso Caesoninus, who was Praefectus Urbi under Tiberius (Tac. Ann. vi 10). If this be so,
as he was born in ΛΑΜ). 705, and had at this time a son verging at least on manhood (for
to no other would this sort of instruction be addressed; see v. 366), the poem must have
been written very shortly before the death of Horace, A.u.c. 746. Orelli and Kirchner,
and many others, take this view of the date. Estre, Franke, and many before them, put-
it earlier, and in that case a different Piso must be assumed. The person supposed by
the advocates of an earlier date is Cn. Calpurnius Piso, who belonged to the party of
Brutus and Cassius, and fought together with Horace at Philippi. He had a son who was
consul A.o.c. 747, and if he was the youth referred to the Ars Poetica must have been
written a good many years before. But the question is one it is impossible to decide, and
nothing turns upon it for the understanding of the poem, which, like many others, might
be addressed to any body; though Ι (10 not agree with those who suppose Horace had no
particular persons in mind. The Pisones above referred to are numbered 8, 22, 23, in
the Dict. Biog.

As to the purpose of the poem I have tried to help the reader in judging for himself by
a careful division of the Argument. It will be seen that the rules are miscellaneous, and
have little or no method, and that the history of poetry which Horace gives is more
fanciful than real. It is impossible to look upon it as a finished poem. We are carried
from precept to history, and from one sort of poetry to another without warningg
and though a general connexion may be traced between the principles of one kind and
tho—se of another, no pains are taken to separate the rules that belong to each.= The iulos
and history of the Drama are chiefly dwelt upon, with what particular bearing upon
Roman poeti-y it is not easy to see. Much that is said ωτι have no reference to it at nu,
and could afford no instruction to a Roman. The observatione on this subject are inm·-
rupted now and then by irrelevant observations, and on the whole there can bo liffle

doubt either that the Ars Poetica was published after Horace’s dmth, out of fingmento -

clumsily put together, or that he published it himself in this mreless way from that
habitual indolence which prevented his ever producing a complete work of any length,
and which is seen in the abruptness with which several of his pieoes are brought to a
close. Attempts have been made to re·arrange the materials so as to form a perfect
whole, but the means of doing so do not exist. The place now invariably assigned to the
Ars Poetica was first given it by H. Stephens. In the MSS. and earlier editionsit is
inserted before the Satires. Some editors treat it as a third Epistle belonging to the

GARM INUM ΙΙΙ. 29.

J am clarus occultum Andromedae pater
Ostendit ignem, jam Procyon furit
Et stella vesani Leonis,
Sole dies referente siccos:
J am pastor umbras cum grege languido
Rivumque fessus quaerit et horridi
Dumeta Silvani, caretque
Ripa vagis taciturna ventis.
Tu civitatem quis deceat status
curas, et Urbi sollicitus times
Quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisque discors.
Prudens futuri temporis exitum
Caliginosa nocte premit deus,
Ridetque si mortalis ultra

Fas trepidat. Quod adest memento

Componere aequus ς cetera fluminis
Ritu feruntur, nunc medio aequore
cum pace delabentis Etruscum
In mare, nunc lapides adesos
Stirpesque raptas et pecus et domus
Volventis una non sine montium
Clamore vicinaeque silvae,
Cum fera diluvies quietos

SATIRARUM 1. 6.

395

Ut cupiat formosus, eat quacunque puellis
Iujiciat curam quaerendi singula, quali

Sit facie, sura, quali pede, dente, capillo:
Sic qui promittit cives, urbem sibi curae,

Imperium sore et Italiam, delubra deorum,

Quo patre sit natus, num ignota matre inhonestae,
’ Omnes mortales curare et quaerere cogit.

“Tune Syri, Damae aut Dionysi filius, audes

Dejicere e saxo cives aut tradere Cadmo 3”

two characters, and the correspondence οἰ 1483), ⁴ camo,' to which he adds the note

the names proves nothing, even if they are
the same, which is not certain. (See note
on the former Μ.) A foul-mouthed

nofthesame uameoccursinthe
next Satira (v. 8).

³1. Ut capiat] Cruquius, Torrentius,
and others aster them, have ‘et cupiat!
The MSS. vary. The old editions 1 have
seen (Veu. 1⁴83, Ascensius, 1519) have
‘ut' which Bentley restored. Orelli pre-
fers ⁴ ut,' saying it shows more clearly than
‘et’ the disorder Barrus laboured under,
which was a longing to be thought hand-
aome. 1 do not see that one expresses it
more clearly than the other, and the ‘ ut’

in two lines reads harsh, as above
in vv. 5, 6. The preponderance of au-
thority seems to be in favour of ‘ ut,’ and
⁴ et ' is more likely to have been invented.
The sense with ‘ut’ is, ‘it' any one were
afflicted with the same disorder as Barrus,
that he should long to be thought handsome.’

34. Sic qni promittit] This plainly
refers to the fine promises of candidates for
office, and the three principal magistracies
are implied: the city praetorship in the
words ‘urbem sibi curae3' the consulship
in ‘imperium et Italiam;' and the aedile-
ship in ⁴ delubra deornm!

38. Syri, Damae ant Dionysi] These
were common names of slaves. Τὴο prac-
tice of executing criminals by throwing
them from the Tarpeian Rock (part of the
Mons Capitolinus) was not common in the
later period of the republic. It was never
applied to slaves, who were put to death
chiefly by cmcifixion outside the city on
the Esquiliae. (See Epod. v. 99, η.)
‘Cadmus' is said by all the Scholiasts to
have been a public executioner of that day:
“carnifex notae crudelitatis ’¹ (Acron).
But the carnifex had nothing to do with
the execution of citizens. There is another
reading, which is adopted by Laudinus (Veu.

‘⁴ species vinculi oetfl Constantine, in his
Greek Lexicon, under the word τῆμος, re-
commends the word ‘mmo’ here, and it
occurs in one of Cruquiua' MSS. landinus
mustalsohavehaditin his3 butitappean
to be only au error of the transcribet. Con·
stantine’s interpretation of timec—that it
wasa sortof bitput into the mouthosa
slave by way of punishment—if correct,
would prove that the word has no place
here, since Horace is speaking os the punish-
ment οῖ citizens, not of slaves.

rather favours ⁴ Camo! Cruquius proposes
⁸ Bathmo ' to represent the Gemoniae, the
declivity from which the bodie- of male-
factors were throwu after their execution.
1 have an impression that ⁴ Cadmo ¹ is not
the right word3 but I do not feel disposed
to adopt either of the others.

40. At Novius] Τὴθ upstart who is
supposed to be addressed in the previous
lines is a plebeian tribune, and he here
affirms that if his birth is low, that of his
colleague Novius (who may be any body3
see note on S. 3. 21) is still lower. Freed-
men and persons following low trades were
admitted into the senate and forced into
high magiam-acies by Julius Caesar, and it
was not till some years after this Satire was
written that Augustus purged the senate of
these memberS. The words ‘gradu post
me sedet uno ' are not easily interpreted.
Cruquius' Scholiast explains them of the
fourteen first rows at the theatre which
were assigned to the equites (Epod.iv. 15. n.)
“in quatuordecim. gradibus equestris digni-
But them
is no reason to suppose that there was any
distinction of priority among the occupants
ot' these seats. Orelli doubts between two
interpretations: one that the speaker is a
senator, and therefore entitled to aseat in
the orchestra, while his co e is but an
‘eques,’ and therefore can only sit iu the

tatis sedet uno gradu post me.”

Q. HORATII FLACCI

CARMINUM

LIBER QUARTUS.

CARMEN Ι.

A.u.c. 739.

1¹1· is cle-r that Homoe, after the publication of the first three books of his odoe, leid
nido that style, or wrote in it only oooesiomuy. So fn· as his lyricel compositions ex-
preeeed‚ if in his cese they ever did, my real passion, growing years and bodily infirmity
would naturally turn him from writingodae. So fer ns his poems were mere imitsfions
of the Greek, we cun understand his getting tired of that style ns he grew older, end
turning to the more original and serious task which employed him in the Epistles. Of
the lighter sort, therefore, we find bnt few in this book, and those probably inserted to
mnkenpn sufficient volume. But his severel- style he had not lost, end none of his earlier
oompodfiom sni-poss the moral end historieel odoe of this book. Why he should have.
written the first it is not eoey to say. It was composed apparently ‘ invite mnm’ end
«neptune smoothnoes of its rhythm it has little to commend it. Nobody will read it end
believe thntthe men was in love who wrote it, still less thet he was influenced bys drivel-
ling affection for the boy Ligurinas mentioned et the end, and in C. 10 of this book. Per-
hup-hefluunds Greek ode thsttookhisfencyand imitated it, and then publisheditmfiu-
his book, not as a prologue to it, ns many of the chronologists snm—sor what is there in
the ode that beers that character ἓ sse fifth verse says it was written when he was about
fisty, which ege he etteined on the luth December, Ast-c. 739. Δ fragment of Alcman

ἔρος με δ’ αὖτε Κύπριδος ἕκατι
γλυκὺς κατείβων καρδίαν ἰαίνει-

seemstobepntofm odewhich this of Horace might be imitated fmm. Solikewise

οη of Ibycus (2 Bergk)—

. ἔρος ofni με κυανέοισιν ὑπὸ βλεφάροις ‘ratio’ ὄμμασι δερκόμενος

κηλήμασι παντοδαποῖς ἐς ἄπειρα δίκτυα Κύπριδι βάλλει·
ἦ μὰν τρομέω νιν ἐπερχομένων, rank.

1 do not associate the ode with C. iii. 26 sorthe reasons there stated. But there is so much

ffblsnce between this md C. i. 19 es to confirm me in the opinion that they-re
imitntions.

ARGUMENT.

Artthon etwnr with me nguin, Venus? spere me, for 1 am old. Go to the young. Go
to Penllus, for he is noble, handsome, elever. Give him the victory, and he will give
thee in return e marble mnne in a shrine of cin-on, with incense, music, end dnneing
in his home by the Alban lake. Ι have no longer a hem-t for love and wine, md yet,
Ligurinas, why do 1 weep end dream of thee?

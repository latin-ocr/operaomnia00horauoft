572 HORATII FLAOOI⁴

EPISTLE V.

As to Torquatus, the person whom Horace in this Epistle‘ invites to dine with him, see
C. iv. 7, Introduction. The occasion was the evening before Caesar's birth-day (v. 9),
which Porphyrion says means C. Julius Caesar. His birth-day was on the leth July
and this dinner was given in the summer (v. 11). But the name Caesar put absolutely
could only apply to Augustus at this time, and Comm. Cruq. differs from the other
Scholiast, and says rightly it must have been the birth-day of Augustus, which was the
23d of September. The expression ‘aestiva’ does not accurately cor-respond to that
time, for autumn began the day before the Ides of September. But that is not very
important. The heat is never so oppressiva as in September in a war-m climate. Franke
goes farther, and because Dion Cassius says (54. 8) that in Anu-c. 734 this anniversary
was kept with especial festivities, he thinks it must have been written that year3 in which
argument he supports himself by the age of the wine, which was drawn off in the second
consulship of T. Statilius Taurus, Α.σ.σ. 728. It is clear that from these data not much
can be derived. The wine certainly was none of the best, and perhaps would not keep
long. It may have been only six years old therefore 3 but it may have been less, and ιι
Augustus’ birth-day was kept every year and especially observed no doubt by his ffisnds,
and nothing is said about unusual festivities here, there is nothing in this to fix the dats
in A.u.c. 7345 but if any thing the reverse, since the mention of the day might poehaps
have led to something more if it had been a special occasion. Besides, the dinna- Ν ⁷
not given on the birth-day, but the night before, and the holiday is referred to because
the man of business would have nothing to do next day, and might lie in bed late and
therefore sit up late. ΤΙιθ Epistle contains a good-tempered invitation to dinner,
nothing more. It is the fashion with a good many of the commentators to find ont the
characters of Horace's friends from his Odes and Epistles, and in various parts of this
they see allusions to the pride and avarice and parsimonious tendency of Torquatus, as
well as his fondness for good living, just as from the last it is discovered that ‘libullus
was of a morose and melancholy turn of mind, and given to brooding over his missor-
tunes. This is mere trifling.

S] potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis
Nec modica coenare times olus omne patella,

1. Si potes Archiacis] The Scholiasta
all say these were short couches called
after the name of their maker, whom Por-
phyrion calls ‘ Archias,' Acron and Comm.
Cruq. ⁴ Archaicus3' from which Lambinus
first, and others after him, suppose that the
word is from the Greek ἀρχαϊκοῖς, towhich
it is answer enough that the second syllable
of that word is long. The great majority of
MSS„ and the best now existing, have
‘Archiacis3' and though many of the old
editions have ⁴,Archaicis ’ it is as from the
name of the maker, not from the Greek.
Laudinus (1483). for instance, has ‘Ar-
chaicis,¹ and explains it‘ ‘vilioribus et ple·

beiis, ab Archia inscio fiibro factis? ’and ιο
with Ascensius (1519).

2. olus omne] The fare Horace offen
would not be very inviting to a modern
diner-out; but he seems to have lived
chiefly on the produce of the gardan him-
self, and ‘olus omne ’ may have been a sort
of salad or other dish compounded of dif-
ferent vegetables. Τὴο dinner is fixed at
a rather late hour for the time of year, to
give Torquatus time to finish his business..
(See S. ii. 7, 33, n.) ‘Patella' is the
diminutive of ‘patinaf as ‘catillum ’ of

‘catinum ’ (S. i. 3. 90).

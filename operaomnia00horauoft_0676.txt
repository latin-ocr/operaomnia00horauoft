Vina fere dulces oluerunt mane Camenae. — 5
Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus;
Ennius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma

Prosiluit dicenda.

Virtutemne repraesentet moresque Catonis?

ware of Bacchus with the giants and in
India. In the ode celebrating the praises
of Dionysus (ii. 19) we have‘1Evoe, parce
Liber, Parce, gravi metuende thyrso; ” and
below (Epp. ii. l. 5) his apotheosis is spoken
of (as also in C. iv. 8. 34), where there is
the additional confusion that he is called by
his essentially Latin title‘ Liber pater! It
must be borne in mind therefore that,
though the poets confound these names,
Liber was a Latin divinity, while Dionysus
was entirely Greek; and that when the
orgies of the latter were introduced into
Italy they were expelled again, the Liber-
alia, an innocent and cheerful festival,
being substituted for the impure rites of the
Dionysia.

5. Vinafere dulces] Tine ancients did
not spare the reputation of their poets in
this matter; for besides the fame of Cra-
tinus mentioned above, Alcaeus, Anacreon,
Aeschylus, Aristophanes, and many others,
have the credit of indulging freely in wine.
As to Homer, there is no foundation in his
poetry for Horace’s libel, which is simply
absurd. David might as well be charged
with excess because he speaks of wine as
making glad the beart of man. Ennius
said of himself that he only wrote when he
had got the gout· “Nunquam Ροὲῐοι· nisi
podager.’'

8. Forum putealque Libonis] See S. ιί.
6. 35, ιι. Horace speaks as if he had de-
livered an ‘edictum ' that the business of
the Forum was only fit for the sober aud
dull, who had nothing to do with poetry3
whereupon all that would be thought poets
took to drinking day and night. The old
editions and a large number of MSS. have
‘ edixit! Bentley restored ‘ edixi,’ for which
there is ample authority. ‘Putere ’ is a
stronger word for‘ olere,’ used above, v. 5.

12. Quid, ei quis vultu torvo] Cato of
Utica· is here referred to, of whom Plutarch

says that from his childhood he shoded in
his voice and countenance, and also in his
amusements, an immoveabh, unimpressive,
and firm temper. He seldom laughed or
even smiled; and, though not passionate,
when his anger was roused it was not easy
to pacify him. He set himself against the
fashions of the times in dress as in other
things, and often went out of doors after
dinner without his shoes and tunic3 and
the -fashion being to wear a ‘lacerna'

of bright colour, he chose to wear a dark ¹

one. (Cat. c. 1, 6.) He may have worn
his toga of smaller dimensions thau other
people, from the same dislike to the usagoe
of the day.—‘ Textore ’ is oddly used here,
where we shoqu expect ‘textura-³ 'rba
observation of Comm. Cruq„⁴ ‘Textor hic
proprium nomen est inventoris exiguae
togae? is absurd.

15. Rupit Iarbitam Tim aqmie] 1¹: ap-
pears that the person here called lubitu
was aMauritanian by birth, and that his
Roman name was Cordus or Codrus.
(Scholiast quoted by cruquius in his Supple-
ment, and by Fea.) Timagenes was a na-
tive of Alexandria, where he was taken
prisoner by A. Gabinius and sold as a slave.
He was sent to Rome and bought by
Faustus, the son of Sulla, who gave him
his freedom. He afterwards taught rhe-
toric, and got into favour with Augustum,
butwassofreewith histo nguethathe
offended his patron, and was forbidden his
house. He aliterwards ingratiated himself
with Asinius Pollio, who gave him a home
in his house at Tusculum, where he died.
The Scholiasts agree in saying that Cordus,
called Iarbitas (whether by Horace in joke
or generally by his contemporaries), from
Virgil's Numidian king Iarbas, endeavour-

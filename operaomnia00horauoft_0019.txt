INTRODUCTION.

 

'Bu‘ materials for Horace’s life are derived almost entirely from his own
works. A few additional facts are got from a short memoir attributed
to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th December, A.11.c. 689 (13.0. 65), at or near
Venusia¹ (V enosa), in the Apennines‚ on the borders of Lucania and
Apulia. His father was a freedman ², having, as his name proves, been
the slave of some person of the Horatia gens. As Horace implies that
he himself was ingenuus ³, his father must have obtained his freedom
before his birth. He asterwards followed the calling of a coactor ⁴, a ¹
collector of money in some way or other, it is not known in what. He

made in this capacity enough to purchase an estate, probably a small
one, near the above town where the poet was born. We hear nothing

of his mother, except that Horace speaks of both his parents with affec-

’ tion'. His father, probably seeing signs of talent in him as a child,

was not content to have him educated at a provincial school, but took
him (at what age he does not say, but probably about twelve) to Rome,
where he became a pupil of Orbilius Pupillus ⁶, who had a school of
much note, attended by boys of good family, and whom Horace remem-
bered all his life as an irritable teacher, given unnecessarily to the use of
the rod. With him he learnt grammar, the earlier Latin authors, and
Homer. He attended other masters (of rhetoric, poetry, and music
perhaps) as Roman boys were wont, and had the advantage (to which

” he afterwards looked back with gratitude) of his father-'s care and moral

training during this part of his education. It was usual for young men
of birth and ability to be sent to Athens to finish their education by the
study of Greek literature and philosophy under native. teachers; and
Horace went there too, at what age is not known, but probably when

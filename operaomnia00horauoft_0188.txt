HORATII FLACGI

ARGUMENT.

On you will be visited your fathers' guilt, Ο Romans, unless ye shall rectore the worship
and acknowledge the sovereign power of the gods. Already have they afflicted our
land; twice the Parthian hath checked our arms, the barbarian hath well nigh destroyed
us in the midst of our strife, the age is so full of shameless adultery and lasdvionsness.
Not from such parents were born the conquerors of Pyrrhus, Antiochus, aud Hannibal,
the manly offspring of soldiers who had handled the plough and carried the faggot.
So doth time spoil all things. Our fathers were not as their fathers, nor we as they3
and our children shall be worse than ourselvae.

DELICTA majorum immeritus lues,
Romane, donec templa refeceris

Aedesque labentes deorum et

Foeda nigro simulacra fumo.

Dis te minorem quod geris imperas ε 5
Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum.

Di multa neglecti dederunt

’ Hesperiae mala luctuosae.

J am bis Monaeses et Pacori manus

Non auspicatos contudit impetus

Nostros et adjecisse praedam
Torquibus exiguis renidet.

1. immeritus] 1 do not see the difficulty
said to exist in this word. The ode is ad-
dressed, like the others, ‘virginibus pueris-
que, ’and they could not be said to be re-
sponsible· for the guilt of the civil wars
(deficta) just brought ιο 8 close; but if they
failed to do their duty ln restoring the tem-
ples, and so repairing the consequences of
the wars, they must be prepared to reap
the fruits of them in the displeasure of the
gods. Suetonius, as before mentioned (C.
ii. 15, Introduction), in his life of Augustus,
relates how he applied himself to the resto-
ration of the sacred buildings, which Ovid
also records (Fast. ii. 59, sqq.)‚ and virgil

began (Tac. Ann. ii. 49): “Iisdem tempo-

temp les he built or com pleted were three in
number, dedicated to Liber, Libera, and
Ceres, to Flora, andtoJuno. Seec. ii. 15.

2. Romane] Horace uses ι118 nmo form
again, “Hic niger est, hunc ιιι, Romana,
mveto” (S. i. 4. 85); and Virgil likewino,

“Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, me-
mento’' (Aen. vi. 852). Livy osten ex-
presses himself so, as Quintilian observes
(Inst. viii. 6), ‘⁴ Maxime in ovando valebit
numerorum illa libertas: nam ot Livium
saepe sic dicit ‘ Romanus proelio vider?
cum Romanos vicisse significat?

6. Principium,] See note above on C.
4 41. Orelli here quotes Livy (45. 39):

“Majores vestri omnium m rerum-
et principia exorsi ab Dis sunt et finem sta-
tuerunt.”

9. Monaeses et Pacori manus] Pacorus
was son of the Parthian king, Arsacele'V.,
and appointed by his fatherto command the
army against the Romans in the place of
Surena, who defeated Crassus mlx-c. 7⁰1,
and whom Pacorus put to death. He was as-
sociated with the renegade Labienus, and
overran Syria and a great part of Asia Mi-
nor, while M. Antonius was amusing himself
with Cleopatra. Who Monaeses was is not

HORATII FLAGOI

Defendat‚ neu quid medios intercinat actus

Quod non proposito conducat et haereat apte.

* 19⁵

Ille bonis faveatque et consilietur amice,

Et regat iratos et amet peccare timentes;
Ille dapes laudet mensae brevis, ille salubrem
J ustitiam legesque et apertis otia portis; ’

1110 tegat commissa deosque precetur et oret,

Ut redeat miseris, abeat fortuna superbis.
Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta tubaeque
Aemula, sed tenuis simplexque foramine pauco
Adspirare et adesse choris erat utilis atque

Nondum spissa nimis complere sedilia flatu3

197. amet peccare timentes ,·] Neai-ly
every MS. and efflfion, old and modern,
has ‘peccare timentes,' and the commen-
tators compare the words with Epp. i. 16.
52: “ Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore.'’
From one MS. of Pulmann, Bentley edited
⁴ pacare tumentes,' 81111 010111 commends and
adopts that reading. I see no reason for
doing so. The office ascribed to the chorus
by Horace is “a general expression of
moral sympathy‚ exhortation, instruction,
and warning,” which Schlegel considers the
best description that has been given. He
considers it “as a personified reflection on
the action that is going on ; the incorpora-
tion into the representation itself of the
sentiments of the poet as the spokesman of
the whole human 1800. The chorus is the
ideal spectator. It mitigates the impression
of 8 110811-101111188 or moving story, while it
oonveys to the actual spectator 8 lyrical and
musical expression of his own emotions, and
elevates him to the reg-ion of contempla-
tion ” (Dram. Lit. Lect. v.). In plain
terme, the business of the chorus was to
utter such reflectione as any indifferent per-
sons might conceive on the action before
it, and to address those reflections to the
characters represented, 80 080 1818111811-
dress them to real persons under the same
circumstances.

198. mensae brevis] Compare Epp.· 1.
⁴14. 35, “coena brevis juvat;'' and with

“apertis otia portis, ’' compare C. iii. 5. 23,

“portasque non elausasss' representing a
picture of national security 81111 peace. The
chorus, to whom the principal persons com-
1888ίο81011 their intended crimes and deepest
plots, were held to seerecy as a prime duty.
Thus Medea coolly tells the chorus her
intention to murder her children and her
rival, and reckons upon their secrecy as a

matter of course„ Other 180188ωο are 118-
11101080.

202. Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vineta]
The‘ fibia’ 1180 88 instrument originally
made of a hollow reed (Pliny xvi. 36. 06),
01 8 box· wood 11111οῃ(01111,11”801. vi. 697), or
the shin -bone of some animal, from which
the name is derived. Afterwards it was
brought to greater 110110011011,8811 m .
made of ivory sometimes. It resembled
the flageolet or 018110801. It was usual to
play two‘ tibiae' together, 80 0110011011 08
C. iv. 15, 30, where see note. Τ11000 18 tho
British Museum have 018 bolen. Probably
in the days of Horace they had 81010. 'rho
metal which the 88010810 mlled‘ oriehabun’
isunknown.1twas not to be 1088110108
18 Pliny’ s time. The derivation 11018 the
Latin ⁶ aurum ¹ and the Greek χαλεῦς10
etymologically 81108111, and the quantity of
the first syllable disproves it. The 18010
probable derivation 10 from ὄρος and χαλ-
κός, 1110 meaning being ⁴ mountain-bronze!
With this the parts of the ‘tibist’ which
took to pieces 80 our flutes do, wem 1108811
81 1110 joinings. Bentley 81111 oth

‘,juncta ' which 10 the reading of 1110οέ

0111110110 and some MSS. The, 11001 have ·

‘vinctas Horace says that 111 0111111101 days
the‘ tibia' served for 88 800081
the chorus, but afterwards it 08180 ω dmum
it. In those days the populationof aad?
was smaller, the theatres less 0101111101, and
the 8811108οο 81010 reverentia! and mave.

What timos Horace alludes to it· 10 diffieult ¹

to say. Orelli thinks his history of choral
music 10 8 fanciful account, fluctuating won-
derfully between the practice of the Greeks,
that of the Romans, and that which 1110 own
imagination has drawn3 and this is perhaps
the 0800.

GARMJNUM IV. ⁷ 14.

Exercet Auster, Pleiadum choro
Scindente nubes, impiger hostium
Vexare turmas et frementem

Mittere equum medios per ignes.

Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus,
Qui regna Dauni praefluit Apuli,

Cum saevit horrendamque cultis

Diluviem meditatur agris,
Ut barbarorum Claudius agmina
Ferrata vasto dimit impetu

Primosque et extremos metendo

Stravit humum sine clade victor,

whole pusmge between the might of Tibe·
rius and of other headlong things rushing to
the work of destruction. 1 do not know
what he means by his note on ‘ignes'

“forte historia est ad quam alluditurp.er ”
For‘ per ignes' Bentley proposoe‘
ense& without any authority. ‘Ignes

nme senae· as Sil. Ital„ medios
ignes mediosque per ensee” (xiv. 175);

permedias volitare acies mediosque per
§guest (xv-41). Ov. Met.viii.7:6
perign ignesperg ladiosausiml' TbeScho-
lint (Comm. yCruq.) sufficiently explains
‘pu-igne& “per med¹ um pugnae sm·-
vorem, per medium ardorem belli.''

25. tamisomir] This· is taken from the
Greek ταυρόμορφος, applied to the Cephisus
by Bul-ip. (Ion. 1261). sse only other
Italian river thatwas represented under this
form was the Eridanus, of which virgil

says (Geor-g. iv. 371, sqq.): —-
“Et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu
Eridanus, quo non alius per pinguia culta

In mare purpureum violentior effluit am-
nis.”

He was therefore represented not only with
horna, but with gilded horus. It is re-
markable that, although this feature is
attributed to several rivers by the poeta (to
theRhineby Ovid‚ Trist- ἰν. 2. 22, andto
different Greek streams, especially Achelous
their type, who lost one of his horus while
contending with Hercules), none of them
are so represented ιιι the ancient works of
art that have survived. Horace has pro-

bably invented this description of his native
river by way of magnifying its importance‚

und ranking it with the greater streams.

Whenca this conception of a bull as repre·

septing the form of a river- god may have
arisen it is not easy to say, but probably

from the brunching osso many large streams
at their mouths, though that would not
apply to the Eridanus. The Aufidus, which
now is mlled Ofanto, is invariably described
by Horaceas a boisterous stream3 und so
Silius describes it, who had laes interest in

’ magriifyingitsimpomnoe2—
‘ia agood word, and usedby othersinthe

“Sanguineas tumidas in campos Aufidus
Ejeucffiasoedffitque furens sua corpora
ripis.” (1320)

But the character of such streame varied
greatly at different seasons of the year.

28. meditatur] This is the oldest and
most authorized reading, and that of the
Scholiasts, one of whom, Porphyrion, finds
fault with it. ⁸ Minitatur ’ is the reading of
many MSSq and some editors have adopted
it; Bentley among others. His reasons
ha’ve no weight at all, as any one will
acknowledge who reads them. They are
not worth repeating. The Scholiasts’ ob-
jection, that ⁸ meditatur' denotas a sus-
pended action rather than one in progress,
bad as it· is, is better thau any of Bentley’s;
but it would apply equally or more to

‘minitatum' and the fact is that‘ medituri'
denotas an act as well as the premeditation
of it, like the Greek word to which it ia
8ὶ111,μελετᾶν. See C. iii. 25. 5, ιι. It
does not, therefore, neoessarily imply any
pause between the threat and the accom-
plishment of the threat' ιιι this instance. 1
do not think therefore that Orelli has hit
the true force of the word, when he says it
is ‘sine dubio longe ποιητικώτερον] 'be-
cause it expresses the silent and &embling
expectation with which men are looking for
the coming deaelation.

31. metendo] Horace (like Virgil, Aea.
x. 513: “Proxima quaeque metitgladio' ')
gets his word from Homer (ΙΙ. xi. 67), οὶ δ’

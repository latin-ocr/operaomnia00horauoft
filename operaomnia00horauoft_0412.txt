had an affection for him, as we know,

among other sources, from Epp. ii. l. 245,

sq .:

“gt neque dedecorant tua de se judicia

tulerunt
Dilecti tibi Virgilius Variusque poetae ;.”

Augustus also

on which passage Comm. Cruq. informs us
that Augustus had made a present to each
of these poets of 8 million sesterces. This
is confirmed by the Parisian codex referred
to in his life in the Dict. Myth., which says
Varius received this sum for his Thyestes.
(See C. i. 6. 8, 11.) Varius and Virgil are
often mentioned together by Horace, and
Martial puts them all together (xii. 4, to
Terentius Priscus):

‘⁴ Quod Flacco fuit et Vario summoque
Μὲἔὲἔῐῗέἐ atavis regibus ortus eques,
Gentibus et· populis hoc te mihi, Prisce
Fa'rrn‘izrel‘jiyii'sse loquax chartaque dicet
anus.

45. Proxima Campano ponti] After
Sinuessa the Appia Via continued to take a
southerly direction and crossed the Savo
(Savone) about three miles from that town,
and vjust within the borders of Campania.
That river was crossed by a bridge bearing
the name Pons Campanus, near which was
a small house erected for the accommoda-
tion of persons travelling on public business,
where there were officers appointed to sup-
ply them with ordinary necessaries. “ Pa-
roehi autem copiarii dicuntur ἀπὸ τοῦ παρ-
έχειν 81) exhibere: hodie autem a copiariis
praestantur haec iis qui reipublicae musa
iter faciunt'’ (Porph.) “Parochi genus
officii quia solent peregrinis salem et ligna
praebere, et significat publicum cursum’'

47.8 Hine muli Capuae] When it
reached the right bank of the Vulturnus,
four miles below the Savo, the Appia Via
turned, striking inland along that bank of
the river, which it crossed at the town of
Casilinum, where Hannibal met with stout
resistance from the Romans who garrisoned
it after the battle of Cannae (Liv. xxiii. 17).
This, Cramer says, is the site of the modern
Capua. About two miles sartha· on the
road, which now took a south-easterly direc-
tion, lay Capua, on the site of which is
the modern village Santa Maria di Capoa.
There the party arrived ⁴ betimes,’-in time
probably for dinner, aster which meal Mae-
cenas and others of the party went to play
at ball, while Horace whose sight, and
Virgil whose digestion, interfered with that
amusement, went early to bed. On the
mode of playing with the‘ pila,' the student

Exercises: and in Smith’ 11 Dict. Ant„ art.

‘Pila' Virgil is said by Donatus (Vit.
Virg. c. vi. 519) to have had uncertain
health‚ and to have suffered aeq-nently
either from toothaehe, headache, or com-
plaints of the stomach.

tinuing in a south-east direction, passed
through two small Campanian towns, Ca- '
latia (le Galazze) and Ad Novae Nova);
but the usual halting-place after pua was
the town of Caudium, which was the first
Samnite town on the Appia Via, and was
situated at the head of the pass called
the Furcae or Fauces Caudinae, celebrated
for the surprise and capture of the Roman
army by C. Pontius‘ 111 the second Samnite
war, A. u. c. 433. The site of Caudium is
not easily made out. Cramer fixes it at
Paolisi or Cervinara, and mentions (from
Pratilli's treafise on the Via Appia) that

EPISTLE XIII.

This letter professes to be written by Horace to one Vinius Asella, the bearer of certain
volumes of his to Augustus at Rome, Horace being probably at his own estate. He
writes as if he had given his friend particular and anxious instructions when 118 started
as to how 118 was to behave, and as if this was to be sent after him to overtake him 011
the road, in order to impress those instructions upon his memory. It is probable that
some such jokes may have passed between Horace and his messenger when he started,
and that he amused himself afterwards by putting them into the form of this Epistle,
which it is not unlikely he showed Augustum but more 1 think is made of it 111 this
respect than it will bear, as if it were written for the especial purpose of commending to
Augustus the modesty of the writer, and apologizing for the iun-usion, and so forth. 1
cannot see any such design. The person is assumed to be ignorant of the world, and
therefore liable to make mistakes in the execution of his mission3 to intrude at an 1111-
seasonable time3 in the eagerness of his affection for Horace to be too officious; to carry
the books awkwardly, so as to draw attention, or to stop in the streets in order to tell
his curious friends what important business he was upon. The person addressed is
called Vinius, and the allusion in v. 8 leads to the inference that his cognomen was
Asellus, or Asina, or Asella. Asellus was a cognomen of the Annia, Claudia, and
Cornelia gentes. Asina also was of the Cornelia. Porphyrion calls the man Vinnius
Asella, while the other Scholiasts call him Caninius (which may be an effor for Caius)
Vinnius Fronto Asina. There was one T. Vinius Philopoemen proseribed by the trium-
virs for concealing his patronus, whose name therefore was the same, and 1:110.th ⁴
gens was in existence at this time. It has been conjectured by Dacier, and believed by
others, that the person here addressed was one of the five tenants mentioned in the next
Epistle, v. 3. The conjecture may be taken for what it is worth. No one can deny that
he may have been one of those persons. He was not, as Orelli says, a ‘tabellarius ’ or
letter carrier, as his name sufficiently shows, for a ‘tabellarius’ was a slave, yet some
have treated him as such.

What the volumes were that Horace was sending to Augustus it is impossible to say
for certain, but Ι think it probable they contained the three first books of the Odes, and,
if 30, the Epistle was probably written in A.u.c. 730. Franke thinks so very decidedly;

but all do not adopt that date, and some suppose the Satires to be the ‘ volumina ' re-
ferred to.

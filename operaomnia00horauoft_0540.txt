HORATII FLAOGI

Quam nequiere proci recto depellere cursu 3''

4-4 Venit enim magnum donandi parca juventus,
Nec tantum veneris, quantum studiosa culinae.

Sic tibi Penelope frugi est, quae si semel uno

De sene gustarit tecum partita lucellum,

Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto.

Me sene quod dicam factum est : anus> improba Thebis

Ex testamento sie est elata ι cadaver

Unctum oleo largo nudis humeris tulit heres,

Scilicet elabi si posset mortua;
Quod nimium institerat viventi.

Neu desis operae neve immoderatus abundes.

Difficilem et morosum offendet garrulus ultro;

tem libidini moderatam in omni re servare
constantiam.'' The Greek σώφρων corre-
sponds ιο ‘frugi,’ according to this defini-
tion, though Cicero limits its meaning as
much as he extends ‘fx-agi! ‘Discreetv’ is
the nearest English word perhaps corre·
sponding to 4 frugi.'

79. maynum donandi parca] Τ1ιο suitors
are once only mentioned as offex-ing presente
ιο Penelope, and their velue was not great.

(Odyss. xviii. 290, sqq) They were of· ,

fered' m co uence of the taunts of Pene-
lope herself. It is likely Horace had this
passage in mind. It has been suggested
that we should read ‘Venit enim magno,
donandi parca juventus,' understanding
Teiresias ιο mean that the price of her
virtue was high and the suitors were mean.
There is no authority for ‘magum' which
is enough to dispose of the reading. Other-
wise it is plausible.

80. studiosa culinae] This corresponds
with Horace's description. See, among
other places, Odyss. ii. 55, where Tele·
machus complains of the suitors thus. ¹

81. Sic tibi Penelope fraqi eet, quae]
4 Sic ' means ⁴ to that extent! that is, pro-
vided she has no great temptation: but if
she once get-s a teste of any old man's
money she will be chaste no longer. The
proverb that follows' is Greek. Theocritus
has it (x. ll) μηδέ γε συμβαίη’ χαλεπὸν
χθρίων Κύνα γεῦσαι.

84. anus improba nebia] ‘ Improhn’
seems to mean ‘sly,' which we wo call
4 wicked.’ See S. l. 9. 73.

87. Scilicet elabi ει· ponet] 4 Of course
it was ιο see whether she could esoepe from
him when dead,' or ‘in hopes that she
might! We are to suppose, as Comm.
Cruq. sayS, she had made it a condition in
her will that if he did not carry her without
letting her drop he was to forfeit the inherit-
auce. Of this story Esne says (p. 555)=

considers it ιιιι incredible story. It is

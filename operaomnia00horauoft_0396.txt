Scholiasta had ‘ elige,’ and that is the read-

ing of Ven. 1483. The earliest edition that
1188 · erue ’ ap to be that of Aldus
(1501), from which time all the editors, 1
believe, adopted it till Talbot returned to
the old reading, which Bentley adopts, but
considers it may be a gloss, and substituted
for ‘arripe‚' which he proposes. Three of
- the Blandinian MSS. had ⁴ eripe‚' which he
thinks supports his conjecture. Sanadon
adopts ‘ arripe,’ though its author does not.
It is difficult to decide. ‘ Erue' is an un·
likely word to have been coined, and · elige ’

would signify ‘ digging out,’ or bringing out
something hidden, as in Lucret. (v. 279):

‘¹ Sic unumquidvis paullatim protrahit aetas
In orpgdipm, ratioque iu luminis eruit

But it may bear the simple meaning of
⁴ extrahere.' The true reading, in my opi-
nion, lies between ‘ erue ’ and ⁸ elige,’ and
1 am rather inclined to with Stephens,
who says (Diatr. ii. p. 59), “pro ‘erue'
quidam codd. habent ⁴ elige ' quod e glossa
sumptum videri potest.''

26. Aut ob avaritiam] There is a change
of construction or an ellipse here which has
led some later editors to change ‘ob ' into
⁶ ab ’ with the ablative. There is no MS.
authority for ⁴ ab avaritia ς’ for though
Marcilius (ap. Bentley) edits it “ tanquam
ex membranis,” such assertions are always
to be suspected where the MSS. are not
named, and are unsupported, as here.
Bentley adopts ‘ ob,’ and is quite indignant:
“indignandum plane—quod editores toties
admoniti pus merum et scabiem impune
adhuc prodire patiantur,'' where the ⁴ pus et
scabies ' is the received reading. ‘Labo-
rare ob ' every one will see is an unusual
construction, but the reading of all the
MSS. is not on that account to be rejected.
The sentence begins with 0118 form of ex-
pression and ends with another: that ap·
pears to be all. Orelli quotes Tacit. (Hist.
ii. 50): “ non noxa neque ob metum ;’' 81111
Livy (xxxv.iii 39). ·11011 tam ob recentia

taken variously to mean from sunrise to

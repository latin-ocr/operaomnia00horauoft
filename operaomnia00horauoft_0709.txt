EPISTLE ΙΙ.

This Epistle is addressed ιο Julius Florus, to whom also the third of the first book was
written. (See Introduction.) Its professed purpose is ιο excuse Horace for not having
sent Florus any verses. He says he had warned him before he went that he should not
be able to write3 thatsshe had grown lazy. He reminds him too that he had originally
only written verses to bring himself into notice because he was poor, and now had not the
same stimulus. Besides he was getting on in years, and people's tastes were so various,
and the noises and engagements of the town so distracting, and the trouble of giving and
receiving compliments so great, that he had abandoned poen-y in disgust. It was benet
to study philosophy, in pursuance of which he reads himself a lecture of nearly a hundred
lines, the substance of which is that he had better be content with what he has got by his
profession, set to work to purge his mind, and leave jests and wantonnees to younger -
men. It seems that Florus wanted him to write some more lyrica, ⁴ carmina’ (vv. 25. 59),
br which he had no mind. Whether he had already published the fourth book of Odes
is not certain, for there are no sure means of determining the date'of 'the Epistle. But
there is no appearance of its having been written about the same time with the other
Epistle. Aa Kirchner says, there is no reason to suppose Horace would have kept a
poem of so much merit locked up in his desk while he was putting forth the first book.
Resides which Horace wrote to Florus on that journey, whereas here he supposes him to
complain of his not having written either letter or versos. 1 am not sure that the first
verse does not betray a later date, though it has led many into dating the two Epistlea
at the same time. Florus was evidently a young man when he went with Tiberim into

HORATII FLAOOI

Dicat et his verbis vacuas permulceat aures:
“ Tene magis salvum populus velit an populum tu
Servet in ambiguo qui consulit et tibi et urbi ’

J uppiter ;”

Augusti laudes agnoscere possis:
Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari,

30

Respondesne tuo dic sodes nomine? Nempe
Vir bonus et prudens dici delector ego ac tu.
Qui dedit hoc hodie cras si volet auferet, ut si
Detulerit fasces indigno detrahet idem.

“ Pone, meum est: ” inquit.

Pono tristisque recedo.

35

Idem si clamet furem, neget esse pudicum,

Contendat laqueo collum pressisse paternum3
Mordeat opprobriis falsis mutemque colores?
Falsus honor juvat et mendax infamia terret

Quem nisi mendosum et medicandum? Vir bonus est quis!

40

Qui consulta patrum, qui leges juraque servat,
Quo multae magnaeque secantur judice lites,

than to the above encomium? Literally,
‘Do you answer in your own name?' or
‘on your own account?' ⁴ Vaeuas aures '
are ears which, being unooeupied. are ready
to receive what is spoken. 1 do not think
Orelli is right in comparing ‘ patulae aures'
(Epp. i. 18. 7ος ii. 2. 105). The meta-
phors are different.

27. Tene maffia—populum] The mean-
ing of this is, ⁴ may thy country ever care
for thee and thou for thy country with an
equal affection! “ Patiens vocari Caesaris
ultor ” (C. i. 2. 43) is the same construction
as here.

32. Nempe Vir bonus] Quintius is
suppooed to answer ¹ Yes, surely, 1 like to be
called good and wise, and so do you.’ ‘Nay,'
replies Horace, ‘ such praise as this is given
one day and may be withdrawn the next3
and you are obliged to resign your claim be-
cause you know you do not deser-ve it. But
if a man attacks me with charges I know
Ι am innocent of, is that to affect me ?'

40. Vir bonus est quie ι’] The answer is
to this effect: ‘⁴ In the eyes of the people
the good man is he who never transgresses
the laws; who is seen acting as ‘judex ’
in important causes, and has never been
known to be corrupt; whom men choose
as their sponsor, and whose testimony
3:53?AE {¹35„¹¹1¹‚.?Z1¹1¹{‚2311¹32¹223¹23¹3³ 5ss5¹5
may know him to be foul within though
fair enough without.'’

41. Qui consulta patrum] Of the com-

ponent parts of the Roman civil law Honos
mentions three. ‘ Jura ' significa legul

rights and rules of law. It has the latter ,

meaning here. ‘ Leges,¹ properly so called,
were laws passed in the ‘ comitia cenni-
riata! They were first approved by the
senate, and then proposed to the comitia by
a magistratus of senatorial rank. ⁴ Plebis-
cita,' laws passed by the plebs in their
comitia tributa, were made binding on the
whole people hythe ⁸ lex Hortensia: passed
mu-c. 466, and thenceforward they had the
force of leges. ‘ Senatus-consulta’ appeu-
in some instances to have hui the force of
law during the republic; but it was not, fin·
obvious reasons, till the time of the emph-
that the legislation of the senate began to
sapei-sede the legislation of the comitia.
It did so from Angustns' reigtu that is,
when the legislative and execufive

all passed into the hands of the cupetur,
he exercised the former through the senate
and not through the people3 though‘ legeu’
in the proper sense were occasio mnypased
in the time of Augustus. Horace might
have added other parts of law, aad more
particularly ‘ mores‚’ which were an those
laws that sprang from immemorial usage.
For all the parts of the civil law of Rome
see the passages from Gaius and Cicero
quoted in Dict. Ant„ artu. ‘,'Jus ⁴ Lex,'
and‘ Senatus Consultum! -

42. secantur] See S. 1. lo. 15, n. In

the next verse the reading of nearly an
the MSS. and old editions is ἰ-εεροιιεοη,ι

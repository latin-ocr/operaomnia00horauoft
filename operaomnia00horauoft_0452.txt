48. Non isto vivimus illic] We may imagine
the indignation with which Horace listened
to the insolence of his oompanion. He
represents himself throughout the scene as
one wanting in the self-possession necessary
for dealing with such a person, and here he
shows it again. Instead of passing by such
impertinence with contempt, or making it,
as with more address he might have done,
011 excuse for leaving the man, he replies to
him, and vehemently defends his patron
and himself. His adversary’s impertinenoe
only rises higher with this, 00 might be
expected, and is not diminished by the ill-
timed irony in ‘ velis tantummodo : quae tua
virtus, expugnabis,' &c., all of which may
be supposed to be said 111 0 state of excite-
ment only calculated to give the coxoomb
cour-age, he keeping his temper 01111 pre-
tending not to see Horace’s indignation.
This must have been worked up to 0 great
height when the man, persistiug in the
notion that perseverance 01111 intrigue are
sure ways of access to the great man, de-
clares he will take Horace at his word, and
leave no means untried to secure not only
011 acquaintance, but the nearest place 111
Μο0001100’ regard (54). All this brings out
the contr-ast between the two characters
(the one 0 mere man of the world, of 0 low
sort, 01111 1110 other 0 well-bred but not very
energetic gentleman) with great force and
in 0 very amusing way. The German com-
mentators are a little too matter of fact in
their view of the scene I think. —- For
‘vivimus ' (v. 48) Bentley reads ‘vivitur'
on the authority of three inferior MSS.,
and quoting C. ii. 16: ⁴⁴ vivitur parvo bene.’'

But the cases are quite different, 01111 there
is more personal feeling expressed by ⁴ vivi-
mus ' than by ‘ vivitur! An the oldest 01111
11001 MSS. and editions have ‘vivimus'
Bentley also adopts, with 11011 teste, ‘inquam '
for ⁶ unquam ’ in v. 50. The former word
is quite out of place here3 but it is not
surprising that there should be this error in
some MSS. ‘ Sic habet ' is aliteral adapta-
tion of οὕτως ἔχει. 011 1110 construction
¹ quae tua virtus,’ see Key’s L. G. 1131.

59. deducam] “Haec euim ipsa sunt
honorabilia quae videntur levia atque eom-
munia, salutari, appeti, decedi, ’, 110-
duci, reduci, consuli '' (Cic. de 8011001. 0.
18). To attend upon 0 person when he
leaves home is ‘deducere ς’ ‘reducere' to
accompany him on his return. Greet 111011,
when they went out of deors, were usually
accompanied by friends, while number-sos
parasitos and expectants followed their
steps, and were eager to be seen by them
and to be known to have been 111 their

This part of the scene 101110 most humorous
of any. Fuscus knows Horace’s friend
well by sight and character. He was pro-
bably known 01111 shunued as 0 1101001100
by such as had more tact than Horace.
Fuscus seizes the joke at once. They stop
and begin with the usual questions (we do

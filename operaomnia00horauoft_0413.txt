SATIRARUM Ι. 5.

Quae super est Caudi cauponas, N unc mihi paucis
Sarmenti scurrae pugnam Messique Cicirrhi,

near Montesarehio, in its neighbourhood,
various inscriptions have been found, in
which the names of persons belonging to
the family of Cocceius occur. At Caudium,
Coocdus had a handsome house, aud Horace
marks its situation by saying it lay beyond
the public tavern- For ⁴ Caudi' all Cru-
quius' MSS. (and he had some of the best)
‘claudiy and his Scholiast has this
note: “quae est supra Claudii cujusdam
cauponas. Claudii cauponae sive tabernae
est Samnii non procul a Bene-
vmtofl But‘ Caudi’ is, 1 have no doubt,
the right reading. The town was twenty-
one miles from Capua.

51. Nune milti paucis] The scene that
follows repments a scurrilous contest be
tween two parasites Maecenas carried with
him for the entertainment of himself and
his party. The description begins with an
invocation of the Mnse, aster the fashion of
the epic poem—an amusing parody, with
which Aaou says some persons of his day
found fanin and from Orelli Ι find there
are some who have done so in our own.

“Nimis profecto fastidiose, '’ he says.

“utum” says the Scholiast, and most
persons will agree with him. Of‘ Sar-
nentus' we happen to know a little more
than is here recorded, from the Scholiast
onJuvenal, S. v. 3·

“Si potes illa pati, quae nec Sarmentus
quas

ffiefimwnoeffifflmm'

(which Sarmentus, however, was a different
person from Maecenas' parasite, though the
Scholiast confounds the two3 see Plut. Vit.
Anton- c. 59). He says that Sarmentus
was an Etrurian bybirth, and originallya
shve of 'M Favonius (well known in the
civilwars, and put ιο death byAugustus
asterthe battle opf Philippi). On the con-
fisoetion of Favonins’ property, Sarmentus
passed by public sale into the hands of
, who gave him his liberty. He
then got made 8 scriba in the quaestor's
department, and affected the position of an
ffiuoethehnudeffie ἔξω the front row in
e igram was composed
upon him:
“Aliud scriptum habet Sarmentns; aliud
populus voluerat:
Digna dignis. Sic Sarmentus habeat
massas compedes.
Rastia ne nihil agatis aliquis Sarmentum

(The joke ιιι the first line is, that whereas

he had got himself one kind of ⁴ scriptum:
i. e. the office of a scriba, the people wished
he had got another, i. e. the branding of a
runaway slave.) He was brought to trial
for pretending to a rank he had uo claim to
unda· the law of Otho), and got

off only by the favour of the judges, and by
the accuser being put out of the way.
Whenold hewas reducedtogreatpoverty
through his licentiousness and extrava-
gance, andwas obligedto sell hisplaceas
scribe. When persons taunted him with
this he show0d his ready wit by replying
that he had a memory3 by which,
according to Rutgersius (Ven.1.ect.c. xvi.
fin.. where this man’s story is told), he
meant that he had no occasion to write any
thing down, for he could carryit in his head.
It appears that at the time Horace wrote
he was free, and held his scribe’s office,
though he continued to attendMaecenas3
for his adversary says, though he was a
scribe, he was in fact only a runaway, and
still belonged ιο his mistress the widow of
Favonius (v. 66), which is only a joke that
would amuse Maecenas, who had bought aud
manumitted Sarmentus. On the strength
perhaps of what is stated by the above
Scholiast, Porphyrion says Sarmentus was
8 Roman eques, and the same he says of
Messius, but donbtless with as little founda-
tion. When Horace says that Messius was
of the noble blood of the Osci (⁴⁶ Messi
genus Osci sunt,’' Porp h.‘— Osci' being
the nominative plural), he probably means
(as Estre says) what Cicero means by

‘summo genere natus, terrae filins” (Ad
Fam. vii. 9), and also alludes to the sear
on his temple which indicated the diseme
mlled Campanian (the Campanians were of
Oscan doecent), of which Cruquius’ Scho-
liast writoe thus: ⁴‘Hoc enim quasi a
natura Campanis fere omnibus inest, ut
mpitis temporibus magnae verrucae innas-
cantur in modum cornuum: quas cum in-
cidi radunt, cicatrices in fronte manent
quasi notae exsectorum cornuum. In hunc
ergo morbum, id est, faciei vitium, qup
Campani 'labor-ant, jocatur Sarmentus.”
Thissortofdiseaseis calledby Aristotle
σατυρία (de Gen. Anim. iv. 3). ΤΙιο
Oscans also were the authors of the‘ Atel·
lanae fabulae) which were full of broad
raillery and coarse wit, which may have
something to do with Horace's joke. ‘ Ci-
cirrhus ’ is a niekname from κίκιρῤος, which
significas, according to Hesychius, ‘a oock!
With these explanatious most of the allu-
siens will be intelligible.

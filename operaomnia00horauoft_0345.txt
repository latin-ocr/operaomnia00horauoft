 

EPODON LIBER, 17. 315

CARMEN XVII.

This Franks considers to be the latest of the Epodes, written with the ironieal purpose
of making peaee between the poet and Canidia, whom he had ao unmeroifully lampooned,
before tho publication of the poems in which she figures. Certainly the recantation is
notless severe than the disti-ibes. Ι do not think it necessary or feasible to assign it a
date, and am not disposed to agree with those who from v. 23, “Tuis capillus albus est
odoribus,” infer that this Epode was not written. and therefore the book was not pub-
lished, till Horace was advaneed in years, or till aster the composition of C. iii. 14 (A.u.c.
729 or 730), because there he says his hair is beginning to turn grey. 11 his hair was
perfectly blsek it would only enhanee the satire of the above assertion. The whole sub-
ject of this quari-el (as might be expected) is so obscure that it is useless to offer any
conjectures upon it; but no one, Ι think, ean read this Epode and suppose that the affair
ω altogether fictitious. Tbere is too much vigour and genial humour in these verses to
admit of such a notion. Admitting therefore the existence in some shape of Canidia,
1 only deprecate the infer-enses derived from a too literal interpretation of particular ex-
pressions, asnotioed in the former odes referring to this same woman (Ep. iii. 8, n.; v.
Introd. δια).

ARGUMENT.

Ι yield, Ι γίοΙᾱς Ι praythee byl'roserpine,byDiana,bythine own mightyspenecmdis,
eease thy chax-ms ; stay, stay thy wheel. Achillen had eompasm'on upon Telephus, and
healed him. He was entreated and gave back the body of Hector, aud the matrona of
Tmy anointed him for burial. Circe restored the eompanions of myssa. Surely Ι
have been punished enough, Ο thou that art loved of sailors and of hucksters ! The
oemplexion of youth is gone from meg my hair is white3 1 roet not day or night, and
sighs give me no relief. Ι now believe what 1 onee denied, that Sabine spells are
shaking my breast, and my head is splitting with Μαι-εἰσ charms. What wouldst thou
more? O sea and earth, I am on fire, like Hercules with Naesus’ blood, and Aetna’s
ever-lasting flame. As a ‹trucible filled with Colchian drugs thou wilt burn till I shall
be eonsumed, and my ashes sesttered to the winds. What death or what penalty
awaits me? Speak, and 1 will offer a hundred oxen, or praise thy chnsfity in lying
song. The brothers of Helen were entreated and gave the poet back his eyes3 and
do thou, for thou eanst, loose me from my madness. Indeed thou art not debased by
thy parents' sins3 thou dost not soetoer the new buried ashes of the poor; thy heart
is kind, thy hands are pure, thy son is thine own, and thy births are no pretence.

Whywaste thyprayers uponears thataredeafas the rock lashed bythewaves? To
think thou shouldst publish and laugh with impunity at our mystic ritae, and fill the
town with my name! What profit then have Ι of the skill Ι have learnt? ssus
shalt thou live with strength ever renewed for fresh enduranee, as Tantalus vainly
seeks to be at roet, Prometheus to be delivered from his vulture, and Sisyphus to plant
his stone on the top of his mountain. Thou wilt seek death in every form, and it
shall not eome. Ι will besti-ide thee, and spnrn the earth in my pride. what! must
Ι, who ean move imagae, bring down the moon or raise the dead‚—I, the mingler of
love-charms,—must 1 see my spells of no avail for such as thee?

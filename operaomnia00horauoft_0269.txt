1³. Non ineisa] There is a little con-
fusion (which however is easily seeuthrough
hy those who avoid the commentatore and
judge for themselves) in the lines that fol-
low. Hence means to say that the monu-
ments raised to heroes by their country and
their deeds themselves do not shed so much
honour upon them ss the poet’s verses do.
Be illustrates the deeds of heroes by the ex-
' of the Scipiones, md the poet’s voeses
thepoemBnniuswrote in prsiseof the
Rider. Itistruethat, ifwe knewnothing
of thedestruction of Carth-gebutwhatis
hoeementioned,w„emight supposethstthe
who desnoyed it was celebrated by
⁸ and confusion would nise. But
uwedonotsuppose Horace wasignoraut
thu was burnt hy Scipio Afri-
oenus Minor, and that Ennius died many
ffloebefioro that event, so neither would
mume such ignorsnce in his
mdes. When he says that the defeat
offlannihnlby theelderSeipioand the
destruction ofy Carthsge by the younger,
do not hold up their name more nobly
than the muse of Calabria, who does
not supply in his ovvn mind‘ ‘which was
employed in doing honour to the elder ?''
If, as Bentley says, every boy of ten years
old knows ss much ss this,so much the less
obsmrity is there in the sentence. He pro·
posen to mend it by omitting altogether the
seventeenth verse, which, he says, halts ιιι the
mette and confusa the author's meaning.
The remedy is simp le; but the MSS. we
possess or have any record of all contain
unt verse. The other remedioe propo&
are to change ‘incendia' into some word
which shall not be' map plicable to the con-
quests of the elder Scippio, and Cunningham
hnssupposed‘ impe ndia' tobetheword,
Dofflng‘ stipendia,pe Hermann‘ dispendial
none of which are at all satisfactory 'l'hat
no word short of destrucfion (implying
therefore that they younger Scipio is meant)
existed' ιιι the copies of one of the Scholiasts
(Comm. Cruq.) may be infer-red from his
note, “ quia contra foedus juramento violato
Romanis rebellarunt.” Others suppose that

⁴ incendia’ does not neoesmily mean the
burning of carthago, but is only another
way of e ⁰ g the overthrow of its
power by the elder Scipio, or his burniug
of the fleet, or of the camp of Syphax.
But, comidering the notor-iety of the final
destruction of that dty by sire, this would
only be charging Horace with wantonly
confusing his readers. And yet it would
seem thntthe Scholiastssndtheoldercom-
mentators an understand but one Scipio to
bereferredto, and theymust have under-
stoodthe line therefore in some waycon·
sistent with such an in 'on. lt must
not be overlooked that the verse “ Ejus, qui,”
δια, applies to either of the Scipiones. An-
other remedy which is proposed is to sup-
pose that two verses have beenlost aster
the seventeenth, which would have explained
its menning3 the ground of which hypo-
thesis is, thuode- in thismensure,of which
however there are but two others (C. i. l,
mdiitao), are sowrittenastobeoepable
of division into stanzss of four lines each,
and this ode wants two versos to enable it
to meetthat rule. But the rule is arbita-ary
and a precarious foundation for such nn as-
sumption ss the loss of two versoe, of which
no traoes whatever are to he found in the
oldest MSS. and commentator-s. On the
whole 1 see no sufficient objection to the
verse to require its being omitted or bnnded
with asterisks, though the authority of
Buttmann, who thinks it spurious (Mytho-
logus, vol. ii. append. Horas und nicht-
Honz), will have weight, as it should.
But his objectionis founded on the rhythm,
whichIhardlythinkcanbeadmittedas
sufficient ground. Baxter’s note is more
sensible than his usually are: “Nollem
Bentleius ita se turbaret quod Horatius
Scipionum acta in unum· fere coegerit poe-
tici compendii studiosus. Certe vel summis
poetis ejusmodi ἀνιστορησία leve admodum
est crimen. ”

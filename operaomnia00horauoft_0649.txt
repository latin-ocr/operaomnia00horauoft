Quorum hominum regio et qualis via, (nam mihi Baias
Musa supervacuas Antonius et tamen illis

, l. mae eit hieme Veliae,] Velia or
Elea. smnus as the residence or Xeno·
phanes, the founder of the Eleatic school of
philosophy, and the birth-place of Parme-
nides and Zeno, was a town of Lucania,
near the mouth of the river Helos or Eleos
(Alento). It was said to have been founded
about A.u.c. 30⁰ by the Phocaeans of
Ionia on the ooeasion of their migration re-
lated by Herodotus, i. 165 (see Epod. xvi.
15, n.). The ruins of the town still exist
on the site called Castelamare della Bruca.
From the Topica os Cicero (c. i.) and Epp.
ad Fam. (vii. 20) we learn that Trebatius,

’ wbo is introduced in S. ii. 1, had estates

there. On his way from thence to Rhegium.
when he ssed from Rome aster the death of
caes-r, Cicero compiled the Topica, and he
wrote the above letter to Trebatius from
that place, and probably from his house,
which he makes remarks upon. There are
many coins of Velia extant with the in-
daipflom YBAH. ΥΕΛΗΤΩΝ. ΕΕΛῘΑ.
Salernum in Campania was situated at the
head of the bay of Paestum, now the Gulf
of Salerno, on the heights above the modern
town, which is close to the sea. It was a
Roman colony, but was originally built only
as a forti-ess to be a check on the Picentini,
in whose country it was situated. These
places were not very much frequented it
would seem at this time, but a new doctor
was bringing them into fashion. Salernum
was situated on a very good road, the Via
Aquilia, of which there was a branch from
Picenum as far as Paestum. From thence
to Velia, about twenty miles, there was no
Roman road.

2. Baiae] Τὴε atmosphere of Baiae
appears to have been clear, and the place
atti-active (Horace calls it ‘liquidae,' C. iii.
4. 24, and ⁴ amoenae,' Epp. i. 1. 83).
This made it the most favum-ite resort of
wealthy Romans. To invalids there was
the additional atti-action of hot sulphurous

springs. See among other places Ovid
(A. A. ἰ. 255) 2-
“ Quidverpigeram Baias, praetextaque littora

Et quae de calido sulphure fumat,
aquam?”

and statius (silv. iii. 5. 96) :—

⁴¹ Sive vaporiferas, blandissima littora. Baias,
ffloedtatidicae seu visere tecta Sibyllae

Horace had been in the habit of going to
Baiae, as we may infer from his connecting
it with the Sabine hius, Praeneste, and
Tibur in C. iii. 43 but it appears he was now
advised to try a different treatment, and
seek some other climate. A letter of
Cieao’s to Dolabella (ad Fam. ix. 12)
begins in this jocular way:—“ Gratulor
Baiis nostris siquidem nt scribis salubres
ἔξω ‘oemmtffit‘ :effi ‘⁸ ”3⁸¹3ss

1 assen u um
sunt oblitae sui.” The place therefore was
not healthy in Cicero’s opinion, or Dola-
bella had found it disagree with him before.
‘Supervacuus’ means ‘useless’ the place
would do him no good.

3. Musa—Antonitw] This physician
was a freedmau of Augustus, and came into
notice chiefly through curing him of a bad
illnaes he contracted in the Cantabrian ex-
pedition (see above, Epp. 13. 3), on which
occasion Suetonius (c. 81) tells us that Au-
gustus ‘⁴ distillationibus jecinore vitiato ad
desperationem redactus contrariam et ancipi-
tem rationem medendi neceaeario subiit, quia
calida fomenta non proderant, frigidis curari
commisi, anctore Antonio Musa? which
gave rise to the caustic words Seneca makes
Livia address to Augustus (de Clemen. 9.
4) :—“ Fac quod medici solent ubi usitata

Musa came into fashion, and having found
cold bathing successful with the emperor,
he appears to have made that his general
principle of treatment. At any rate he re-
commended it ta) Horace, the Scholiast says,
for his eyes; and he followed his advice,
not without reluctanoe, as it would seem
from this Epistle. A statue was erected to
Musa by subscription near that of Aescu-
lapius in gratitude for Augustus' restora-

CARMINUM I V. 6. 233

CARMEN VI.

Am. c. 737.

The appointment of Hornee to oompose the principa! ode at the Secula· Gnmes A.u.c.
737 seem to hue given him much ple-sure, md to have given his mind n new stimulus
in hvon: of ode-writiug. To the honour thus eonferred upon him we owe, perhaps as
much ns to Augustus’ bidding, this fourth book, of which the third, sixth. eighth, and ninth
ull beor mnu-ks of the legitimam pride that dmmmnoe nwnkened. This sixth ode is a
kind of prefnee to the Secula· Ode, nnd dwells chiefly on the prnisae of Apollo as having
been the shyer of Achilleo, md thereby having preserved Aeneas to be the founder of the
Rom family : and having prayed for oud obtained the help of that god for the tnsk he
is going to perform, Horace turns, ns choi-ugus, to the members of his chorus, and
insu-uota them in their duty.

guile bu't by mel soree, but that Jove had granted Aeneas to thy prayer-s and those of
his deu· Venus. O Apollo, support the honour of the Roman muse. His spirit is upon

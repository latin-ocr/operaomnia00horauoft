their meat till it was high, in hopes of a guest dropping‘ ιιι to share it. Would 1 had

(v. 94.) Yon do not disregard your character. But what disgrace as well as ruin these
luxuries bring upon you 1 how your relations hate you, and how you will hate your-seit·
when the last as is spent with which you would gladly have bought a rope to hang
yourself!

(v. 99.) ⁴⁴ But I can afford to be exn-evagantss’ says one. well, if you have more than
you want why not give alms, restore temples, contribute to public works? The world
is never to go wrong with you, 1 suppose. But, tell me, you whose enemies shall one
day laugh at you, which man is best fitted to meet the chauces of fortune, he who
seeks great things, or he who is content with a little and buckles on-his armour in timo
os peace to meet the struggle that is coming? As an instance, look at Ofella. When
1 was a child he was rich, but he lived no more ostentatiously than now that he is
poor. He lives on a hired farm, on the estate of which once he was master, and thus
he talks to his children z ⁴⁴ My fare on ordinary days was nothing but a dried pig's foot
and vegetables; and when a friend dropped in we made ourselves merry with a chicken
or kid from the farm, and plain fruit for a second course; and then we played and drank
and poured libations to Ceres, who made our hear-ts cheerful and our faces merry. Let
Fortune be as hard as she will, how can she rob us? Have we lived in lasa comfort
since the stranger came, my children? Nature made neither him, nor me, nor any
one else, perpetual owner of the soil. He has expelled me; he will be driven out in

” his turn. Now Umbrenus, now Ofella is master. So put on stout hear-ts and be ready
to meet adversity when it comes.''

QUAE virtus et quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo,
Nee meus hic sermo est, sed quae praecepit Ofella
Rusticus abnormis sapiens crassaque Minerva,

1. boni,] This opening being something
like that of C. iii. 2, the word ¹ boni' has
given some coloni-to the reading “Angustam,
amici, pauperiem pati '' (see note). It would

Bentley suggested in his St. Galle MS..
and it is to be regretted that Bentley had
not sufficient confidence in his own conjec-
ture to adopt it in his text. He was de·

seem from Fea’s various readings that nearly
all the old editions read ‘bonis‚' which 1
find in Ven. 1483, and Ascensius, 1511.
Many MSS. also have that reading. Fea
adopts it; but, as orelli says, it probably
arose out of the ¹ s ' that follows. All his
MSS„ and all the Parisian (Pottier’s) and
the Blandinian, all Torrentius’ but one of a
late date, five of Lambinus', in short nearly
all the best have ‘ boni.'

2. quae praecepit Ofella] Τ1ιε received
reading i'n Bentley’s time, and that of all
the old editions, was ‘ quem praecepit
Ofellus.' Torrentius preferred, but did not
edit, ‘ quae,’ which he found in three of his
MSS. Bentley was the first to take it into
the text. I am surprised to find Heindorf
and Dillenbr. retain ⁴ quem.’ Bentley also
conjectured the reading ‘ Ofella ' for ⁴ Ofel—
lus :’ the former being a known Roman
name, a cognomen of the Lucretii ς and the
other being met with neither in history nor
in inscriptions. Orelli has found the name

terred by the authority of John of Salisbury,
who mentions one ‘ Ofellus ' as the author
of a homely proverb about superstitious
people who trusted in dreams. The Scho-
liasts had ‘Ofellus,' and every edition but
Orelli's has the same, as far as 1 know. 1
have no doubt ‘Ofella’ will now become
the unquestioned reading. Estre adopts it
without hesitation.

3. abnormis capiens nauaque Mineruia]
A man wise without rule and of plain
mother wit. Cicero (de Amicit. c. 5)p uses
the expression‘ ‘agamus pingui Minerva”
as a proverbial one. Orelli’ s idea that
the proverb is derived‘ ‘a textura rudi,'
I do not understand. Minerva was the
goddess of wisdom, and ¹ crassa Minerva'
therefore means a coarse kind of wisdom. ,
(See Mr. Long's note on the above passage
of Cicero.) ‘ Abnormi,’ the reading of some
of the best MSS.. is quite out of place.
‘ Crasse Minerva’ is proverbia13 ‘abnormi
Minerva ¹ is not so.

his time, in which Apollo appeared in the
midst. After recounting the Muses and
their attributes severally, he adds: ·—·

Apo llo's attribute as the Healer is one
ofpo the oldest that was attached to him,
and is most commonly exhibited in his
statua and other representations. It is
symbolized by the serpent which always
attende the figures of Salus, Aesculapius,
and ethes connected with the healing art.

serpent Python, even when there is nothing ‚

god. Ovid (Rem. Am. 76) addroesae him
as ‘⁸ Carminis et medicae, Phoebe, repertor

of some MSS. and editions, bnt‘ arcae’ is
better. 1 understand‘ felix' to agree with
‘ aevum,' and ‘videt' to govern ‘arces' ‘rem’

parenthesis, makes ‘ aevum ' the object aster
‘ prorogat,’ and takes all the adjectivae with
‘ lustrumss as though the meaning were
‘Apollo is advancing the age into another
happy, and even a happier lasne! He
prefers the indicative to the subjunctive.
Many good MSS. have it so, but most edi-

think they are right. Bentley is consistent,

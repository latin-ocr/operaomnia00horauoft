Dum ex parvo nobis tantundem haurire relinquas,

Cum ripa simul avulsos ferat Aufidus acer.

satisfy the wants of nature, though ιιι some
conditions of society, in which the wants of
nature become confused with the wants of
fashion, he would find it hard to do ³03 and
the fault lies in a great degree, though not
entirely, with the social laws or habits
which create that difficulty. The case
Horace supposes is that of a man who pro-
fesses to wish to live reasonably, and has
greater wealth than a reasonable mode of
life requires. What value, he wishoe to
know, has the surplus for its owner? The
supposed answer (introduced as usual by
⁴ at ⁷) sounds irrational, and even extravagant,
but it is the only solution of avarice in its
simple form.

53. cumeris] Acron explains ⁴ cumera'

as a larg e basket of wicker work or earthen-
· ware vegssel like a ⁴dolium,' in which the
poorer sort kept their wheat. He says there
was a third sort of vessel of smaller capacity
containing five or six 4ιιιοᾱιι,’ called in the
Sabine lan ‘trimodia’ This last piece
of information is not worth much.

54. liquidi] This word is used for ‘ aqua
by ovid (Met. v. 454): ‘⁸ Cum liquido
mixta perfundit diva polenta.” By referring
to the article 4 Sextarius ' in Smith's Dict.
Ant„ it will be found that the ‘ urna,' one
of the Roman liquid measures, contained
half an ‘amphora,’ or twenty-four ⁴ sextarii!
As observed before (C. iii. 19. 14), the
⁴ cyathus ’ contained one-twelfth of a ‘ sex-
tarius!

55. malim] All the editions before
Bentley had ‘ mallem,’ which he changed to
4 malim,' not without MS. authority. Fea,
Cunningham, Sanadon, Meineke, and others
have the present. ⁴ Malim ’ simply means
4 1 would rather ς’ 4 mallem‚' ⁴ I would have
douc it if I could, but the time is past-⁹

ua’ something ιιι Bentley’s

Heindorf defends ‘malim. ⁹ The ‘violens
Aufidus’ spis nafive river, C. ιιι. 30.10)
is made to represent the absent οι· συρίσαι
stream, because it is Horaee’s to
represent a rapid river as well aa a broad.
Swinburne (‘ vaels ιιι the Two Sicilia:
vol. i. p. 165) says of this river, which he
visited ιιι the summer of l778,‘ ‘there wne
but little water in it, and that whitish and
muddy; but from the wideness of its bed,
the sandbanks and buttresses erected to
break the force of the stream, it is plain
that it still answers to Horaee' s epitheta of
fierce, roaring, and violent.’' SeeC. iv. 14.

59. imula· eq et quanto ert opum] From
some unknown MSS. which lambinns says
have⁴quantu1n,' Bentley flat mad-
ing. All the editions before him and ιΙ
other MSS. have 4 quanto! The nominum

‘quantum' is admissible, as Bentley ln·
shown (see alm Key's L. Gr. 5 999, note).
and if the weight and existence of lambinun’s
MSS. were more certain, there would be
sargument (the eom·
mon one) that the copyists were more likely
to change‘ quantum' into‘ quamo' than,

vice versa, the ablativa into the nomiman. -

Heindorf has ‘ quantumst but hm also ‘tan-
tum habet' for 4 tantuli «ιμ’ which, aa he
does not notice the reading, seems like a

ωῗίῐιῗυὶῗηα parc] “Bona pars· major'’
(Acron). “Bona nunc pro magna dictum,

ut saepe Ennius et alii veteres” (Ροι-ρὴ..)
See Terence (Eun. i. 2. 43)= “Nam hic
quoque bonam magnamque partem ad te
attulitl’ Cic. (deOrat. ii. 3):⁴ ‘Aiebatbonam
partem sermonis in hanc diem essedilataml’
A. P. 297: ‘⁸ Bona pars non ungues ponere
curat.'' On ‘cupido,' see C. ii. 16. 15, ιι.

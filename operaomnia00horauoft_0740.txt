HORATII FLACCI

“ Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.”
Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu?
Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte :

“ Dic mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Trojae
Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes.''

Non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem
Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin.

braced the birth of Helen the daughter of
Zeus and Nemesis (not Leda), the judg-
ment of Paris, the abduction of Helen, the
sacrifice of Iphigenia, and the events of the
first nine years of the war. of the other
poems 000 was the Νόστοι by Agias of
Troezene, on the return of the Grecian
commanders from Troy, the wanderings of
Menelaus, the murder oi' Agamemnon, and
the revenge of Orestes. Another was the
Τηλεγονία of Eugammon of Cyrene, which
continued the history of Ulysses till his
death by the hand of his son Telegonus.
The Thebais and Epigoni, relating the con-
10010 between Argos and Thebes, are also
included in the Cyclic poems, but their
authors are unknown. (See for more par-
ticulars Miiller¹s Hist. of Gr. Lit. c. 6.)
There was a later Epic poem called Thebais,
the author of which was Antimachus of
Claros, a contemporary of Plato. Porphy-
rion (on v. 146) calls him a Cyclic poet,
from the subject of his poem, the extent of
which was such, he says, that he had filled
twenty-four volumes (that is, twenty—four
books) before the armament arrived at
Tbebes (see note on the above verse). The
poem notwithstanding seems to have been
much admired.

139. Parturiunt montes,] Τ110 reading
of the old editions and many MSS„ ‘par-
turient,' is undoubtedly wrong. Verbs
ending in ‘urio ' sig-nify purpose or desire,
and ‘parturio' has the same relation to
‘ pario ' that ⁴ esurio ' has to ⁴ edo,’ meaning
the effort or desire to bring forth, the being
in labour. Porphyrion quotes the proverb
on which this and the fable that Phaedrus
has imitated (iv. 22) of the mountain 10
labour, are founded: ὤδινεν οὖρος εἶτα μῦν
ἀπέκτεκεν, which 10 Athenaeus (xiv. 6) 10
quoted a little differently: ὤδινεν ὄρος,
Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο, τὸ δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν.

145. Antiphaten Scyllamque] These
are all stories from the . Anti-

phates was king of the Iaestrygonss, a
gigantic race in Sicily, who devoured three
of Ulysses' companions and destroyed his'
ships (x 80, sqq). The adventure with
Polyphemus the Cyclops forms the leading
event of the ninth book. The description
ofScylla and Charybdis is contained' 111 tho
twelfth book (vv. 85, sqq..)

146. Nec reditum Diomedis]
related in the Cyclic poem called Νόστοι
above mentioned. Mel euger, who was ono
of the Argonauta, aud was still 111010 famous

variously related. According 10 Homer 110

GARM INUM ΙΙ. 14.

Quin et Prometheus et Pelopis parens
Dulci laborum decipitur sono 3
Nec curat Orion leones

Aut timidos agitare lyncas.

the in 've ⁴ quin,’ corresponds to that
of οὐκοῦν. See Key’s latin Gr. 1172, note.

38. laborum decipitur] See ii. 9. 17, n.
The MSS. are divided between ‘laborem ’
and ‘laborum.' But, according to Jani's
collection of various readings, the majority,
andsomeof the best (all the Blandinian),
luvethegeixifive3 and thiswas the reading
of the Scholiasta. Inmbinus, Graevius,
Heinsius, Bentley, Sanadon, Cunningham
prefer the accusative, which would be equi-
valent to πόνον κλέπτεται, which might

shnd; but the more usual construction
would be πόνων ἑπιλὴθεσθαις aud ⁸ obli-
visci,’towhich ‘decipi ’ is equivalent, govern-
ing the genitive case, 1 think Horace wrote
⁴ laborum: and not ⁴ laborem!

⁴0. lyncum] Elsewhere this word is only
used in the feminine gender. The MSS. are
unanimously in favour of the masculine
here. The hex-om are represented as follow-
ing their old pur-suits in Elysium by Ho-
mer (Odyss. xi. 571, sqq.) and Vix-gil
(Aen. vi. 651, sqq.).

GARMEN XIV.

If Postumus be in this instance a real name, Horace's friend may have been the person
to whom Propertius wrote a beautiful elegy (iii. 12) on *the occasion of his going, as

Ἴ Kuinoel supposes, with the unfortunate expedition of Aelius Gallus against the Arabiam,

though there is no resemblancebetween the ode and the elegy, unloes it may be traoed in
Hoeace’s ¹ placens uxor ¹ (v. 21). Propertius reproaches Postumus for leaving his affec-
flonate wife Galla, whose fidelity he comparas with that of Penelope. Estre supposes it
likely that this Postumus is he who am. 5 was consul suffectus, and Aa). 10 u-iumphed
fm- his victories over the Dalmatiam. This was Postumus Vibius. But it is all very un-
certain. The ode is clearly one of those to which any other name might as well have
been prefixed, since it only deals with Horace's ordinary commonplace, the certainty of
deathforall men. The tone is rather more melancholy than usual. Jani chooses to
suppooe that Postumus was rich, but covetous and self-indulgent‚ afraid of death, and too
careful of his health. Dacier supposes Postumus to be no other than Julius Florus, to
whom the third epistle of the first book and second of the second book are addressed.
The Julian family, he says, frequently bore this sumame, and the qualitiae which Honoe
assigna to the one he asm‘gns also to the other, those qualitiae being ambition, sear of death,
and a host of others. (See Epp. i. 3. 25, and ii. 2. 205, sqq.) But u Horace does not in real-
ity charge thoee vices upon either of his friends, as will be readily seen by an attentive
render, they cannot be identified by this comparison. The date of this ode is as uncertain
as the person, though J ani, from its sombre tone, supposes it must havebeen written late.

ARGUMENT.

Time is slipping away, Postumus, and piety will not retard the approach of age or Death.
No sacrificas will propitiate Pluto, who keeps even the giants Geryon and Tityos beyond
that stream which all must ‹xi-oss, even though we expose not oux-selvas to the dangers
of war, the sea, and climate. Thou must leave home, wife, and all thou hast behind,
and thine heir will squander what thou hast hoarded.

Eunu fugaces, Postume, Postume,
Labuntur anni, uec pietas moram
Rugis et instanti senectae
Afferet indomitaeque morti,—

Dicas adductum propius frondere Tarentum.

Neu si te populus sanum recteque valentem

12. Fons etiam] De Chsupy (iii. 542)
thinks he has discovered this stream in a
rivulet which now bears the name latini,
which he considers to be a corruption of
Horace’s own name. Obbarius says it is
mlled “fonte del Oratino,'' or by con-
tractiori “fonte Ratino.'' It runs from
west to east, close to the ruins above
mentioned, and flows into the Licenza, by

which the valley is nearly bisected. There

is another stream a little further to the
north, which is called Fonte Bello, and
which might perhaps more likely be Ho-
race’s ⁴ fons! The source of the Digentia,
according to this writer, is in the hius at
the north-eastern extremity of the valley,
but he says the river gets more regularly
supplied from the above little tributaries
than from its own fountain head. That
⁴ fons ¹ means the fountain of Bandusia, as
some say, has been disproved in the Intre-
duction to C. iii. 13.

See notc on v. 8 os
De Chaupy says of the

‘ fonte Ratino' that the purity and cool-'
ness of its waters were equal tc those of
Bandusia, which he had visited.

15. dulces, etiam εἰ credis amoma] A
place may be ‘ dulcis ' from association or
other causoe: it can only be ‘amoenus'
from its climate. its beautiae, and so forth.
Bentley's conjecture, “et (jam si medis)
amoenae '' is very bad, in my opinion. Aa
to ‘ Septembribus horis ' see S. ii. 6. 18, n.,
and for ‘audis' see note on v. 2⁰ of the
same Satire.

24. pudor malus] See C. ii. 3. 39, n.
He says it is a salse shame that would in-
duce a patient ω conoeal his sores from the
physician3 and so it isfor a man tohidc
hisdefecm rather than bring them to the
wisc to cure. Τ1ιο idea contained in vv.
22, sq. is expanded by Persius in his power-
ful manner (S. iii. 88, sqq.)

Quintius had no doubt seen service3 but,
says Horace, if any one were to speak of
your campaigning in such lang-uage as this
(then he quotoe two lineS, said by the
Scholiasta to be taken from Varius’ pane-
gyr-ic on Augustus, referred to on C. i. 6.
ll), you would recognize it as meant not
for you, but for Caesar. But if you allow
yourself to be called wisc and correct, does
your life correspond to that nameany more

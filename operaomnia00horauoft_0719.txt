EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 2.

Lento Samnites ad lumina prima duello.

Discedo Alcaeus puncto illius;
. Quis nisi Callimachus? Si plus adposcere visus,

ille meo quis!
100

Fit Mimnermus et optivo cognomine erescit.

Multa sero ut placem genus irritabile vatum,

Cum scribo et supplex populi suffragia capto;
Idem, finitis studiis et mente recepta,

Obturem patulas impune legentibus aures.

105

Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina3 xverum
Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur, et ultro,
Si taceas, laudant quidquid scripsere beati.

At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema

Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti;

110

Audebit quaecunque pamm splendoris habebunt
Et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna‘ferentur
Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant
Et versentur adhuc intra penetralia Vestae.

Obscurata diu populo bonus eruet atque

115

Proseret in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum,

the ments that rich men had at their
dinners were gladiatore who fought with
blunt wenpons; and here the oontsgst is said
tobeprohaaed(‘'lento)tillthe lights
ame in. It was a long trial of· skill.

99. puncto illium] ‘In his judgment
or by his vote! When an election took
place, ‚there were certain persons called
³ custodes ’ appointed to take the votes and
prick off the number given for each candi-
date. From this process votes oeme tobe
called ‘ puncta! See A. P. 343, n.

101. Fet Mimnermus] See Epp. i. 6.
65, n. Horace seems to think him superior
to Callimachus, who Quintilian on the
other hand says ¹⁴ elegiae princeps habetur '’
(x. 1. 58). He was a grammarian and
voluminous prose writer as well as a poet, a
native of Cyrene, and established at Alex·
andria in the reigns of the Ptolemies, Phila-
delphus and Euergetes, in the third century
ΕΟ.

-optt‘vo] This word, signifying‘ desiredss
ἵ does not occur elsewhere. But it was ap-
’ plied in later times to those‘ tutores' “qui
ε ex oEptione {uxgprenturf 'which is explained
· on . 1. . .

103? impune leqentibus] He says when
he hm done writing and recovered his
(which was the same thing), he
should stop his ears, and they might recite
without sear of reprisals. Compare ‘⁰ nobi-

lium scriptorum auditor et ultor,” Epp. i.
19. 39, where see note.

110. Cum tabulis animum censoris]
Dobree (Adv. 406) thinks this may be imi-
tated from Demosthenoe’ advice to the
δικασταὶ (de Cor. 298. 6), καὶ παρα-
λαμβάνειν γε ἅμα τῇ βακτηρίᾳ καὶ τῷ συμ-
βόλῳ τὸ φρόνημα τὸ τῆς πόλεως νομίζειν
ἕκαστον ὑμῶν δεῖ. The likenaes of the
two passages is not great and only verbal.

113. Verba movere Ioco‚] The notion
of the censor is kept up. See note on S.
i. 6. 20.

114. Et versentur adhuc] This is a.
way of saying that the verses, though they
may be expunged, still are kept in the
author's desk, because he has a regard for
them and cannot make up his mind to
destroy them. Porphyrion explains ⁴ pene-
tralia Vestae' thus: “Id est, domi3 per
quam metaphoram ostendit, quae in animo
nostro fixa versentur, tamen excludenda.
essess’ The san of Vesta could only
be entered by her own priestoeses.

116. speciosa vocabula rerum‚] ‘Ex-
pressive terms ς’ words which make them-
selves intelligible at once: “quae* prima
specie probantur ” (Forcell.). So in A.P.
319 a play is said to be ‘speciosa locis,'
that is ⁴ plainin its points,’ its common -plaooe
or sentiments clearly put.

222 HORATII FLAGGI

Grata carpentis thyma per laborem
Plurimum circa nemus uvidique ἕο
Tiburis ripas operosa parvus

Carmina fingo.

Concines majore poeta plectro
Caesarem quandoque trahet feroces
Per sacrum clivum merita decorus 35

Fronde Sygambros,

Quo nihil majus meliusve terris
Fata donavere bonique divi,
Nec dabunt quamvis redeant in aurum

Tempora priscum.

Publicum ludum super impetrato

the Anio. Bentley changes it to ‘rivos'
(See C. iii. 25. 13, n.) ‘Operosa' de-
scribes, I should think, the process by
which nearly all Horace’s odes were pro-
duced. No great poet is more artificial,
and few more skilled in concealing their
art and giving it the appearance of nature.
‘Fingo’ corresponds to πλάττω, which
word the Greeks used especially with refer-
ence to the making of honey. Bentley
joins ‘plurimum' with ‘nemus.’ It be-
longs to ‘laborem' He rather wishes to
substitute ⁴ floreum.’

33. Goncines] ΤΙιθ pronoun though em-
phatic is omitted, which is not uncommon.
(See C. iii. 17. 5.) ''Concines’ sounds bet-
ter than ‘tu caneS,' and it has particular
force in expressing a chant in which many
voices are joined.

34. seroces] The Sigambri had earned
the epithet of cruel by their treatment of
the Roman officers who, having gone to
collect their tribute, were taken by them and
hanged. See Introduction.

35. sacrum clivum] Martial mentions
this ascent (i. 71. 5.) ι

“ Inde sacro veneranda petes Pallatia clivo.'’

Becker, on the walls of ancient Rome, says
it was a slope in the Appia Via from the
Forum to the arch of Titus. He is quoted
by Orelli, who also refers to the statement
of Bunsen on the Roman Forum (Annali
dell’ lnst. viii. 238): “Le ‘clivus sacer’
montait au Palatin longeant a l'extremite
du Forum le flanc droit du sanctuaire de
Vesta.'' Fea, who appears to have given

great attention to the subject, has the fol-
lowing note on Epod. vii. 8: “As oue
entered the Sacra Via opposite the amphi-

theatre of Flavius between the templa of

Pax and Venus, where now stands the
church of New St. Mai-y, he desoended
gradually to the temple of Antonine and
Faustina, and then asoended gradually to
the arch of Septimius Severus. (This road,
he says, he saw in 1809 when an excavation
was being dug in front of Antoninus’
temple, about 9 feet deep and laid with
flint.) Passing from the Gneo of Triumph
over the Campus Martius, the Velabrum,
Circus Maximus, aud the spot where now
stands the arch of Constantinus, the victora
went in processioa down this ⁴ via,’ with the
prisoners before their chat-iota, to the site
of Severus' arch, and thence the prisona-s
were dismissed to the prison hard by called
Tullianus, while the victors asoeuded the
Capitoline hill, bending to the left, tiu they
arrived at the Capitol.” He then refers ω

Cic. in Verr. ii. 5. 3⁰ ε “ At etiam qui flium· -

phant, eoque diutius vivos hostium duces
reservant ut his per triumphum ductis pnl-
chen-imum spectaculum fructumque vic-
toriae populus Romanus percipere possit,
tamen, quum de foro in Capitolium cur-rum
flectere incipiunt, illos duci in carcerem
jubent, idemque dies et victoribus imperii
et victis vitae finem facit.''

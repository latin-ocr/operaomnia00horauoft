234 HORATII FLAGCI

Ille, mordaci velut icta ferro

Pinus aut impulsa cupressus Euro,

Procidit late posuitque collum in
Pulvere Teucro.

Ille non inclusus equo Minervae

Sacra mentito male feriatos

Troas et laetam Priami choreis
Falleret aulam3

Sed palam captis gravis, heu nefas heu,

Nescios fari pueros Achivis

Ureret flammis, etiam latentem
Matris in alvo,

Ni tuis victus Venerisque gratae

Vocibus divom pater annuisset

Rebus Aeneae potiore ductos
Alite muros.

Doctor argutae fidicen Thaliae,

Phoebe, qui Xantho lavis amne crines,

Dauniae defende decus Camenae,
Levis Agyieu.

Spiritum Phoebus mihi, Phoebus artem

Carminis nomenque dedit poetae.

Virginum primae puerique claris
Patribus orti,

23. ductos] Aen. i. 423: “Pars ducere
muros.'’ The Greeks would say τοίχους
ἐλαύνειν. To follow 811 the 3811383 to which

this word ⁴ ducere' is applied, and to tneo
them to their radical sense, is not easy.

17. captis] From the variation of the
oldest MSS. in this word it has been gene-
rally given up as a genuine reading, while,v
in the absence of a better word, it has been

usually received into the text. Ι do not
think it would be profitable to repeat all
that has been said on the subject, and have
no means of suggesting a better reading.
It must be understood therefore that none
of the editors defend ‘ captis’ as if it were
the word Horace wrote, and that it is only
adopted for want of a better. A similar in-
3181188, 111 which the oldest known MSS. are
supposed to be at fault, is found in Epp. ii.
2. 199. The Scholiasts give us no help in
the matter. ¹ Victis’ and ‘victor ' are among
the various readings of the old and good
MSS. for ⁴ captis ;' and, as these cannot be
mere errors of transcription, it may be as-
sumed that the real word' 13 lost. For this
reason the word‘ cap tis’ is usually printed
111 a different type from the rest.

21. Ni tuiep victus] ‘Flexusst which
Bentley adopts on little authority ’for‘ vic·
tus,’ is an evident gloss.

Th0se who wish to attempt the task will
find amp 18 materials' 111 the examples given
in Forcellini' s Lexicon.

25. Doctor aryutae] Some MSS. have
‘'ductor (corresponding to μουσηγέτης),
others ‘Argiuae’ some both ‘ductor' and
‘Argivae' Bentley thinks ‘Argivae' the
best reading(as “ Graiae Camenae? C.ii.16. “
38), supposing Horace meant to oppose the
Greek to the Roman muse, but he does not
sufficiently trust his own arguments to ad·
mit that word into the text. Jaui says
‘Argivae’ is “haud dubie unice vera lec-
tio.” I have no doubt ⁴ argutae ' is right.
The river Xanthus here mentioned wasin
L cia.

y27. Dauniae] See C. iii. 30. 1⁰, 11.
The Greeks gave this name (ἀγυιεύς) to
Apollo as worshipped in and protocting the
streets of cities.

(v. 87.) me mre what you say ofothas, and to whom you say it. The inquisitive is a
babblcr3 avoid hin: he will repeat what you say, and once said it cannot be re-
anea. Cast not a longing eye on your patron‘s slaves. He may put you off with
oue asa present in satisfactionof your elaims,or he maybe churlish about it aud
unnoy you. Take care whom you introduce, for you may be brought to shame by the
buln of another. If you have ever found a man deceive you, get rid of him, and keep
yourinssueuce for those who are falsely maligned, for may not the same come upon
yourself? Your house is in danger when your neighbour’s is on fire, and you had
better get it under in its beginning&

(v. ⁸8.) Thone who have never tried it think attendance on the great a mighty pleasant
thing. 110 who has is afraid of it. But ss you are embarked take thoee hints for your
guidance. 'nm light-hearted like not the solemn, nor the active the slothful. nor the
alothful the active, nor the drinkers the sober. Put the cloud from your brow: the
modest is liablc to be counted resen-ved, and the silent sour. And withal study wisc
books and leam the seoeets cf a quiet life, and to examine your own condition3 leam
the sources of virtue, the reliefs of sorrow, the means of aelf-oontennnent, and inno-
cent nanquillity.

(v. 1⁰4.) When Ι retire to refresh myself by my own cool aucam, what, think you, arc
myreflecfions and my defirae? That 1 may get no more than 1 have, that 1 may live
for myself, with a good stock of books and a well-stored barn, and a mind calm and
steady. Nay, but this Ι will make for myself3 for the rest 1 will pray to Jove, for

- S1 bene te novi metues, liberrime Lolli,
Scurrantis speciem praebere professus amicum.
Ut matrona meretrici dispar erit atque
Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.
Est huic diversum vitio vitium prope majus, 5
Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,
Quae se commendat tonsa cute, dentibus atris,
Dum vult libertas dici mera veraque virtus.
Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum.
Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi 10
Derisor lecti sic nutum divitis horfet,
Sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit,

EPISTLE VII.

On some occasion Horace, having gone into the comm-y for change of air on account
of h'u health, at the beginning of August, was tempted to stay away the whole mouth ς and
u he had promised Maecenas to return in a few days, he had perhaps got a letter from

, his ffieud reminding him of that promise, and begging him to come back. Maecenas wan

a valetudinaria, and had probably some of the querulous selfishnoes that usually attende
on that condition. We may infer as much from that ode (ii. 17), which begins “ Cur me
qua-elis exanimas tuis?” and he very likely felt the want of Horace’s society at this
time. We can only gather the tone of his letter or moesage from the character of Horace's
reply. He says he has no mind to risk a return of his sicknaes by going back during
the autumn to Rome3 indeed that he meant to be absent at some warm place on the
ooestthmughthewinten thathewas no lougerasyoungand cheerful as he had been3
that he was sure Maecenas’ liberality was bestowed upon him in a genereus spirit, and
that he did not mean to compromise his independenoe ; for if he could suppose such was
the case, he would give up every thing he had ever received rather than forfeit his liberty.
He illustr-ates his position by two moriem—one that of the fox who got into a vessel of
corn aud grew so fat there that he could not get out again (which Horace was determined
ω prove was not his case), and the other a splenetic trick played by L. Philippus upon a
worthy man whom he seduced into leaving his home and vocation and settling on a farm
iu the country, the result of which unnatural change was the total destruction of his
peace and independence. To this too Horace means to say he will never let himself be
brought. .

There is nothing disraepeetfiss or angry iu the Epistle, though it might appear stom a
bare outline like the above, or from a superficial reading, that there was. It was written
aster many years of intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the influence Horace had acquin-ed
with his patron; for though Horace was not perhaps of a servile disposition, as servility

“ was then reckoned‚ he would not have taken this tone if he had not been sure Maecenas

would not take offence at it.
When this Epistlewas written there is no evidence to prove. It is generally attri-

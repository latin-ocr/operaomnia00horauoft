more patrum] Cic. (Tusc- i. 2) tells us
that in the Origines of Cato it is stated that
it was the custom of old to sing songs at
their meals upon the virtues of great men.
Valerius Maximus (ii. l. 10) refers to the
same custom: ‘⁴ Majores nostri in conviviis
ad tibias egregia superiorum opera carmine
comprehensa pangebant, quod ad eas imi-
tandas juventutem alacriorem redderent?
The practice may have been partially re-
vived in Horace's day. The conclusion of
this ode recalls C. iv. 5. 31, sq.

30. Lydis] Plato (de Rep. 3. 10, p. 398,
E) tells us that the Lydian and Ionian
melodies were best suited to delicacy and
feasting, the Dorian and Phrygian to war3
and Aristotle (Polit. vii. 8. 7) that they (the
Lydian) were most suitable to the tender
age of boyhood, as harmonizing the mind
and training it to good. There is no par-

ticular force, however, here in the word
⁴ Lydis! It should be observed, that when
‘ tibia' appears in the plural number (C. i.
1. 323 Epod. ix. 5) it has reference ω two
of these instruments played by one .
Their pitch was different, the low-pitched
tibia being oelled ‘dextra,' because it was
held in the right hand3 the high ⁶ sinistra?
because it was held in the left. The pipo·
used by the Lydiam themselves are called
hy Herodotus γᾷ. 17) αὐλὸς ἀνδρὴἳος and
αὐλὸς γυναικήἳος, as representing the
voices of a man and a woman respectively.
This interpretation has been doubted, how—
ever, and it is the opinion of some that the
pipes w‘ere so called as being played one by
a man and the other by a woman. (809
Mr. Blakesley' s note on the above passage.)
The family of Anchises, the grandfather&
Iulus, are mentioned here, because Augustus
belonged to the Julian family, of which
Iulus was the reputed founder.

Institui; currente rota cur urceus exit-3
Denique sit quidvis simplex dumtaxat et unum.
Maxima pars vatum, pater et juvenes patre digni,

Decipimur specie recti: brevis esse laboro,

Obscurus 11ος sectantem levia nervi

Deficiunt animique3 professus grandia turget ;
Serpit humi tutus nimium timidusque procellae3
Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter unam,

Delphinum silvis appingit, fluctibus aprum.

In vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte.
Aemilium circa ludum saber unus et ungues
Exprimet et molles imitabitur aere capillos,
Infelix operis summa quia ponere totum

Nesciet.

Hunc ego me, si quid componere curem,

Non magis esse velim quain naso vivere pravo,
Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque capillo.
Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus et versate diu quid ferre recusent,

Quid valeant humeri. Cui lecta potenter erit res,

Nec facundia daeeret huuc nec lucidus ordo.
· Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor,

Introduction. Horace W on to say that
thee are thosewho are led into error by
some ahndard of correctam& that they have
set themselves, some rule to which they ad-

, the right thing, another smoothness of ver-

ἑῦαϋοη, another grandiloquence, another
anfion. another vanity, and to avoid the
opposites of these they run into the excaes
ofthem. For ‘ levia’ Bentley reads ‘ lenia’
from one MS„ and fiuishoe a long argument
with‘ ‘Quid ergo? satis jam opinor super-

longs to ‘ variare.

32. Aemilium eirca ludum] This illus·
uates the case of those who can invent
details, 11111 cannot compose an entire poem
Porphyrion says the ‘ Aemilius ludus,' near
which this artist lived, 1133 3 gladiator's
school, built by Aemilius Lepidus, but by
which of those who bore that name is un-
known. There were many celebrated persons
socalled. SeeDict. Biog. The school is said
fio have beon in the eighth region, in or
near 1110 Forum Romanum. The reading

of nearly all the MSS. and all 1113 editions

name of the ‘aes-arius,' while Porphyrion says
it means the farthest corner of the ⁴ ludus,’
which is inconsistent with ⁸ circa! ⁸ Imus ’
has no meaning, and Bentley has done well

S. i. lo. 42, ‘⁸ unus vivorum Fundani ;”

Orelli, and Fea quote a few MSS. in favour

can be no doubt it is the true reading.

‘Imus’ and‘ unus' have been confounded
in another place (S. i. 4. 87). In au

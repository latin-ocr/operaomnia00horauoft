HORATII FLAOGI

Permixtas capiet commotus habebitur, atque

Stultitiane erret nihilum distabit an ira.

210

Ajax immeritos cum occidit desipit agnos:
Cum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanes,

, Stas animo et purum est vitio tibi, cum tumidum est, cor?
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agnam,

Huic vestem, ut gnatae, paret ancillas, paret aurum,

215

Rufam aut Pusillam appellet fortique marito
Destinet uxorem3 interdicto huic omne adimat jus
Praetor et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos.
Quid? si quis gnatam pro muta devovet agna

Integer est animi? Ne dixeris.
Stultitia hic summa est insania;

Ergo ubi prava
qui sceleratus,

220

Et furiosus erit ; quem cepit vitrea fama,
-Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis.

211. cum occidit desipit aquom] This
is a clumsy collocation of words; but >it is
not mended by the commas by which ⁴ de-
sipit ¹ is usually preceded 81111 followed.

212. C'um prudens] Here Bentley 1188
substituted ‘ tu ' for ‘ cum,' which he intro-
duces before ‘ admittis! But the MSS. are
unanimous in favour of ‘cum,' and the
pronoun is not wanted. (See below, v.
234, 11.) For ‘admittis' some MSS. have
⁴ committis,' which was Porphyrion's read-
m .

ἕ214. Si quis lectica] Τ118 ‘lectica’ of
the Romans and φορεῖον of the Greeks
were introduced from Asia, and differed
very slightly from the ‘ palankeens ⁷ in which
from time immemorial the Asiatics have
been carried. For full particulars the reader
may consult Becker (Gall., ‘Exc- on the
Carriages’) and Dict. Ant. The principal
points are mentioned in Mr. Long's note
on Cicero, in Verr. ii. 5. 11: “ lectica octo-
phoro ferebatur!

216. Rufum aut Pusillam] These names
commonly occur 111 inscriptions, as Bentley
1188 shown by quoting several. Other
names have been substituted, and 118 has
Posillam for Pusillam.

217. interdicto huic omne adimat jus]
The law of the XII tables assigned the
charge of persons who were ‘furiosi' to
their relations 111 the male line, ‘agnati,’
and the praetor in later times chose the
person who should act as ‘ curator ' to t-he
insane person. The same law applied tn
‘ prodigi,' notorious spendthrifts. (See
article ‘ Curator ’ in Dict. Ant„ 81111 below
Epp. i. 1, 102, sq.). The story of Sophocles

brought before an Athenian jury hy 1118
sons, and reading the celebrated chorus in
his Oedipus Coloneus, to prove his sanity,
is told by Cicero' 111 1118 treatise on OldAge,
c. 7. Omne Jus means every legal right.

221. hic summa est insania ,·] ‘Insania’

signifies unsoundness of mind generally·

‘’furor the same, accompanied with vio-
lence. Horace’s climax of madmen 18 the
fool, the man of crime, and the ambitione
the worst of all.

222. vitrea] “Aut fragilis aut splendida”
(Porph.). It probably 11188118 the latter, the
glitter of fame. See C. i. 17. 20, where the
epithet is applied to ciroe, but probably
only 88 it is applied to ‘ ponto: in C. iv. 2.
3, 111 the sense of ‘merula’ 88 ὑάλινος is
used 111 Greek.

223. Hunc circumtonuit] This vene,
which has 8 grand Epic tone, Orelli thinks
may be taken from Ennius. But Horace
may have written it himself. He resorts
occasionally to travestie to heighten the
force of his satire. The worst stage of
insanity is represented by one whom Bellona
hovers round with a trumpet ofithunde‘r
and her bloody scourge, and on to
madness, 88 she drove the Roman soldius,
according to Silius’ description of the battle

‘of the Trasimenus (v. 220, sqq.)=

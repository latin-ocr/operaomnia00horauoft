of that virtue does not require an apology.
There are few moral qualities that can be
said to take precedence of it. It is the
basis of friendship, as Cicero says, and
without it society cannot exist. (Compare
S. i. 4. 84, ιι.) It is probable, if Plu-
tarch‘s story be true, that Horace had
heard Augustus repeat his favourite axiom.
Mitsch. quotes Callimachus (Hymn. ad
Cer 118). ·

Δάματερ μὴ τῆνος ἐμοὶ φίλος ὅς σοι

ἀπεχθὴς

εἴη μήδ’ ὁμότοιχος.
Horace seems to have imitated Euripides
(Elect. 1354)· .

οὕτως ἀδικεῖν μηδεὶς Θελέτω,
μηδ’ ἐπιόρκων μέτα συμπλείτω.

This way of speaking seems to have been pro-
verbial. Compare Aesch. S. c. T. 602, s
Theprecise character of the worship of Ceres
at Rome is not easily made out. There were
no myster-ies among the Romans corre-
sponding to the Eleusinian or any of the
other Greek Μυστὴρια. But Cicero, ana-

thematizing Verres at the close of his last
oration, speaks of the rites of Ceres and
Libera (whom the Romans joined together,

though the latter was a Latin and the for-
mera Greek divinity) as those which “ sicut
opiniones hominum ac religiones ferunt
longe maximis atque occultissimis caerimo-
niis continentur;” and, though introduced

from abroad, he, says these rites were ob-
served by the Romans in public and private
with such exactness‚ that they might appear
to have been not imported into Rome from
other countries, but exp orted to them from
Rome. He does not seem to have known
much about the matter.

28. srayilemve] ‘'Que is the common
reading, but there is no connexion between
⁴ trabibus ’ and ⁴ phaselon,' and ‘ ve‚’ which
is Bentley’s correction, is confirmed by the
oldest Berne MS. In respect to ⁶ Diespiter'
see C. i. 34. 5, n.

32. Deseruit pede Poena clauda] Blom-
field quotes this passage in his glossary on
Aesch. Agam. 57·

τῶνδε μετοίκων ὑστερόποινον
πέμπει παραβᾶσιν’ Ερινῦν.

The same expression occurs also in the

qq· Choeph. 382,

Ζεῦ Ζεῦ κάτωθεν ἀμπέμπων
, ὑστερόποινον ἄταν ,
βροτῶν τλήμονι καὶ πανούργῳ

and corresponds to ὑστερόφθοροι in soph.
Antig.1074‚

Tibullus thus expresses the same idea (i 9.

bus!

CARMEN III.

About A.1J. c. 728.

This ode, which could not have been written before anne. 727, when Augustus
received that name, commenda the virtue of perseverance by the example of heroes who
had secui-ed divine honours by it. It cannot be said that the long speech of Juno bears
very directly upon the text supplied by the two first stanzas. A prophecy of the glory
and extent of the Roman empire might have been adapted to any other exordium, or have
been introduced without any at all. But it was necessary for Horace to diversify his
homilies. The mention of Romulus is contrived to introduce the praises and power of

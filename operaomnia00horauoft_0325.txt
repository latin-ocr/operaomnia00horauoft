Thedateofthisodeisncttobemistaken. Itwaswrlttenwhen the news ofActium
was 110011, 111 September, Α.11.0. 723, immediately before the 37th of the lst Book. lt is
addi-cased to Maecenas, and it is 1111ρο3311>10 to read it and suppose he had just arrived
from Actium, where some will have it he was engaged. As to Sanadon, he thinks Horace
wrote to Maecenas while 110 was still on the other aide of the water, than which nothing
ean be more absurd.

ARGUMENT.

When shall we drink under thy tall roos, Maecenas, to Caesar the conqueror, as late we
did when the son of Neptune lost his sseet and fled,-he who threatened us all with
the chains his slaves had worn? Wiu our sons believe it? Romans have sold them·
selves to serve a woman and her eunucha, and the lnxurious gauzo hath ssuttered among
the mdnds of war. But their allies desei-ted to our side, and their ships skulked
from the fight. 10 Triumphe! bring forth the golden chariat and the sacrifice. So
great a conqueror never came from Africa before. The enemy hath changed his purple
for mourning, and hath fied to Crete or the Syrtes, or knoweth not whither to fly.

for Caesar in wine.

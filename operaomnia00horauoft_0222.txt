192 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN XXI.

Τὴθ history of L. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, of his learning and eloquence, and the
origin of his double cog-nomen, under both of which he appears in Horace's poems, ιη’
fully given in Smith's Dict. Biog. The date of this ode, which is addressed to the testa
containing the wine intended for Messalla at a supper to which he has invited himself at
Horace's house, cannot by any sort of evidence be even conjectured. Dillenbr. says it
was a song oomposed extempore at a party at which Messalla was symposia-ch In such
extemporaneous effusions Dillenbr. puts more saith than 1 can3 but the ode may have
been recited at the supper-table, and composed for the occasion it professes to have been
composed for.

ARGUMENT.

Thou amphora, who wast filled at my birth, whether thy mission be one of sorrow or joy,
of siz-ife or love or sleep, come down, for Corvinus would have my better wine.
Learned though he be, he will not despise thee, for neither did old Cato. Thon dont
sosten the inflexible, and open the heart, and bring back hope, and give strength and
cour-age to the humble. Liber, Venus, and the Graces shall keep thee company fill
the dawn of day. ,

unanimous statement of the Scholiasts3 and though it must be admitted that, without
their authority, no ingenuity would have discovered that Menas was the subject of the
Epode, and notwithstanding the appearance of another name the forgery of which it ia
difficolt to account for, in one or two inscriptions, it does not seem that a case has been
made out against that which until recently has been the opinion generally received on the
authority of the Scholiasta. The MSS. with inscriptions bearing the name of Vedius are

person intended but such as itself affords. But the vast majority of MSS„ of which Fen
has cited a large number, are headed with inscriptions to the effect that Menas is the
person attacked, though the copyists had so little respect for these titles that they were
content to take merely the substance of them, since no two MSS. exactly agreein the
words. 1 need not repeat that none of the inscriptions can with any probability he np-
posed to have been affixed by Horace himself.

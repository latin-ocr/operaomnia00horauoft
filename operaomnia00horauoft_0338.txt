HORATII FLAGOI .

Contenta Phryne macerat.

He was a graceful performer on the flute,
which accomplishment, we learn from Maxi-
mus Tyrius (quoted by Orelli), Anacreon
took delight in praising. One of the odes
falsely attributed to Anacreon (16 Bergk) is
addressed εἰς νεώτερον Βάθυλλον· and
from that we also learn that he was a
Samimu, ἣν δ’ ἐς Σάμον ποτ’ ἔλθῃς Γράφε
Φοῖβον ἐκ Βαθύλλου. Anacreon, being
driven from his native town Teos in Ionia,
lived many years at Samos under the pro-
motion of Polycrates. There is a very
graceful eulogy of Anacreon by Critias
(Socrates’ disciple), of whose verses a few
fragments have been preserved. The frag-
ments of Anacreon that remain indicate that
easy style which Horace describes, and
make us lament that the prophecy of
Critias has not been realized. Few literary
losses are so much to ‘be regretted as the
loss of the true Anacreon’s poemS.

tion. The Scholiasta all affirm that Te-
rentia is here alluded to, and there can be
little doubt of it. There was a dancer, or
pantomimus, named Bathyllus, who was a
freedmau of Maecenas, and of whom he
was very fond. Tac. (Anu. i. 54): ‘⁶ Indul-
serat ei ludicro (histrionum) dum Maecenati
obtemperat effuso in amorem Bathyllv'
Juv. vi. 63: “molli saltante Bathyllo) To
this person some have most improperly
referred the words of Horace, supposing
Anacreon's Bathyllus to have been intro·
duced with reference to this player. For
‘ quodsi’ Orelli prefers but does not edit
¹ quando‚’ which he finds (in a corrupted
form ‘miser do q' non') in his MS. B. ⁷
⁴ Quodsi’ appears to me much better, and
all the other MSS. have· it. ⁴ Quo si ’ has
been proposed; but, if that had been tho
original reading, it is very unlikely to have
been changed so universally into ‘quodsi,’
which is a common word in Horaoe.

GARMEN xv.

This is probably a composition from the Greek, and I should think a pretty close imi-⁴·
tation. It is addressed to an imaginary Neaera by the poet in his own person. He
complains of her deserting him for a wealthier rival. Horace introduces the same name
in a much later ode (iii. 14. 21), and it is used throughout the third book of Elegia
commonly attributed to Tibullus. The ode is in Ovid's style, and worthy to have been
written by him. By the same argument that is applied to Epode xi. (see Introduction)
Franke and Kirchner assign to this the date ΛΑΜ). 721. 1 need not repeat how-widely ⁵
such notions in my opinion depart from the true character of Horace's love poems.

ARGUMENT.

Remember that night when the moon was in the sky, and thou didst swear fidelity to me,
saying that so long as the sheep feared the wolf, and storms vexed the winter's sea,
and Apollo’s locks floated in the breeze, our mutual love should last. Thou shalt rae
my firmuess, Neaera. Flaccus will bear no rival. Let thy faithlessness drive him to
wrath and he will seek a true heart elsewhere. Let him once learn to hate thy bcauty
and he will be its captive no more, when grief shall have settled in his soul. And thou,

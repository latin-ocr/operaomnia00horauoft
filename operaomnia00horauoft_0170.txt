HORATII FLAGCI

ANGus‘rAM amice pauperiem pati
Robustus acri militia puer
condiscat, et Parthos feroces
Vexet eques metuendus hasta,
Vitamque sub divo et trepidis agat 5
In rebus. Illum ex moenibus hosticis
Matrona bellantis tyranni ¹
Prospiciens et adulta virgo
Suspiret, eheu, ne rudis agminum

Sponsus lacessat regius asperum

Tactu leonem, quem cruenta
Per medias rapit ira caedes.
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori :
Mors et fugacem persequitur virum,

Nec parcit imbellis juventae

1. amice] Some MSS.‚which Lambinus
and Bentley follow, read ‘amici ς’ and the
ancient title ‘ ad amicos ’ shows that the
Grammarians who first affixed that title had
‘ amici’ before them. And Acron says,
‘⁴ Oden generaliter ad amicos scribit com-
monenS,'' &c. But Horace’s advice is ad-
dressed to the young, as he shows not only
in the introductory stanza of the first ode,
but in the opening also of this. ‘Amice
ferre’ is plainly the reverse of ⁴ moleste
ferre‚' and corresponds to ‘clementer' in
Cicero’s letter to Atticus (vi. i.): “ cnaeus
noster clementer id fert'' (the loss of his
money). “ Ferendum est molliter sapienti '⁹
is another form of expression for the same
meaning (Cic. de Senect. ii. 5). This use
of ⁴ amice' is not noticed by Forcellini, who
probably read ‘ amici! I observe he chiefly
used Lambinus' Horace. ‘Militia,’ in the
next verse, may depend either on ‘ robustus’
or ‘ condiscat! Orelli decides on the latter,
I 'do not know why.

3. Parthos seroces]
nere '' (Acron).

5. sub divo et trepidis] Doering omits
‘et’ against all MSS. and editions, to the
injury of the verse and sense. ‘Et' is
wanted to couple ⁴ trepidis rebus’ with ⁴ di-
vo‚’ as ‘que’ conples ‘vitam agat’ with
‘ Parthos vexet!

“ Species pro ge-

6. Illum ex· moenibus] This picture, re-
presenting the fears of the Parthian mother
and maiden, the danger of their son and
lover, and the prowess of the Roman soldier,
has been much commended. It is notin
Horace’s usual style, and is perhaps better

suited to an ode addressed to the young
than to any other. To them it 'might be
inspiring, but hardlyto older minds. Helen,
looking out with her damsels from the walls
of Troy (Il. iii. 139, sqq.)‚ or the description
of Hesiod (Scut. Herc. 242),—

-αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἐϋδμήτων ἐπὶ

 

χάτλτέξέιιὶυνὸξὺ βόων κατὰ δ’ &phu-ronam
παρειας,

or Antigone looking from the walls of
Thebes (Em-ip. Phoen. 88), were perhaps
before Horace’s mind.

13. Dulce et decorum est] In Horace’s
mind there was a close connexion between
the virtue of srugal contentment and devo-
tion to one’s country. They are associated
below (C. iv. 9. 49, sqq.).

14. persequitur] In this word is contained
all that Bentley would gain by changing it
against the MSS. to ⁴ consequitur-l and it is
more graphic. The line is a translation
from Simonides (65 Bergk),-

ὁ δ’ αὖ θάνατος κίχε καὶ τὸν φυγόμαχον.
Horace may have seen Tyrtaeus' elegy (7
Bergk), which begins—
τεθνάμεναι γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι

πξσΟνΤα
ἄνδρ’ ἀγαθὸν περὶ ᾗ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον,
‘ Persequi’ signifies ‘ to pnrsue and over-
take.' Bentley prefers ⁴ ve’ to ‘ qne,' with
⁶ timid0,’ a change he often makes. His
reason is odd‚—that there was no need for
death to strike in more than one place: one
would be enough. ⁴⁴ Quod sane argutius!”

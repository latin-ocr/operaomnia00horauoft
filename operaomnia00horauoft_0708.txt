HORATII FLACGI

Quam per vatis opus mores animique virorum

Clarorum apparent.

Nec sermones ego mallem

‘250

Repentes per humum quam res componere gestae,
Terrarumque situs et flumina dicere, et arces
Montibus impositas, et barbara regna, tuisque
Auspiciis totum confecta duella per orbem,

Claustraque custodem pacis cohibentia J anum,

25⁵

Et formidatam Parthis te principe Romam,

Si quantum cuperem possem quoque3 sed neque parvum
Carmen majestas recipit tua nec meus audet

Rem tentare pudor quam vires ferre recusent.

Sedulitas autem stulte quem diligit urget,

260.

Praecipue cum se numeris commendat et arte:
Discit enim citius meminitque libentius illud

Quod quis deridet, quam quod probat et veneratur.
Nil moror officium quod me gravat, ac neque ficto

251. Repentes per humum] This is ex-
pressed by ⁴ pedestris! See C. ii. 12. 9, n.
252. arces Montibus impositas, ] See
C. iv. 14. 12, and 33, n. Suetonius (Aug.
21) mys, “Domuit partim ductu. partim
auspiciis suis Cantabriam, Aquitaniam,
Pannoniam, Dalmatiam, cum Illyrico omni :
item Raetiam et Vindelicos ac Salassos.
The ‘ auspicium,' or power of taking the
auspices, the emperors scarcely ever dele-
gated to any one. The, commandere of
their armies were ‘dueesss They had not
‘imperium, 'and therefore couldy not have
‘auspiciuml
255. ,Claustraque custodem pacis cohi·
bentia] That which is commonly called
the Temple of ,Janus was a passage en-
closed between two gates leading out of the
city. A statue of Janus was placed there,
and from this and the two gates the place
was called J anus Geminus. It was built, ac-
cording to tradition, by Numa (Livy i. 19).
The gates were open in war and closed in
peace, but according to Livy they were only
shut once between the reign of Numa and
the battle of Actium. Ovid makes the god
explain the practice thus (Fast. i. 279) :'—
‘⁶ Ut populo reditus pateant ad bella profecto
Tota patet dempta janua nostra sera.
Pace fores obdo, ne qua discedere possit:
Caesareoque diu nomine clausus er0.''

Horace’s explanation is that the gates were
shut during peace to prevent its guardian
from leaving the city. The first time the
gates were shut during the republic was
A.u.c. 519. By Augustus they were closed

three times (see C. iv. 15. 9, ιι.) aster the
battle of Actium and taking of Alexandria
A.U.c. 725, and after the Cantabrian war
A.u,.c. 729. The third occasion is not

known; Casaubon (note on Suetonius, Aug. '
c. 22) says it was the year of Christ’s birth,
on the authority of Orosius, which is not

’' to be trusted. They remained closed till

the defeat of Varus Λα). 9, after which they
were open for nearly fifty years, being closed
by Nero Aa). 58. They were immediately
opened again. and not closed flu am. 71
after the taking of Jerusalem. There is no
other record of the closing of these gates tiu
Α. n. 353, when, according to Ammianus
Marcellinus (lib. xvi.,) Constantius closed
them after the defeat and death of Mog-
nentius. The practice therefore remained
under the Christian emperors.

256. Etsormidatam Parthis] See Epp.
i. 12. 27, ιι.

262. Discit enim eitius] ⁴ Quis’ belongs
both to ⁴ discit’ and to ¹ deridet.' Hormo
says men are more apt to remember what
is ridiculous than that which is good and
serious3 and therefore it is not pleasant to
have one’s name associated with silly verses
or an ugly wax image, such as the admirere
of public men might think to honour them
with. Busts of literary and other distin-
guished men were put up in the public
libraries (see S. i. 4. 21, n.), and were pro-
bably multiplied for sale. They were some-
times made of wax, of which material were
made the family busts preserved in the
‘ atria’ of private houses.

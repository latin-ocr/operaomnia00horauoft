It han been dispoeed of by Kirchner (Quaest- Hor. 656, sqq.) in n wey that cannot be

Brundusium, but the people would not let him come into the harbour (according to
Plutarch), and he therefore went on to Tarentum. Negotiations were carried on between
the two rivuls (Cneeur being nt Rome) through ugente employed by both, but without
effect, till Octavia undertook to 111ch between her husband und brother, und was
finally successful in reconciling them. It has been supposed, with every probability, that
the mission which Horace accompunied was sent by Augustus to meet Antonius on h’u
expected arrival nt Brondusium on this occasion, i.e. in the spring of A.u.c. 717. 'rh-t

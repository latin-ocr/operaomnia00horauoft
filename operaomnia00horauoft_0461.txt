SATIRARUM I. 10. ·

Ut nemo Varius ducit ; molle atque facetum

Virgilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae.

Hoc erat, experto frustra Varrone Atacino
Atque quibusdam aliis, melius quod scribere possem,

Haerentem capiti cum multa laude coronam.

At dixi fluere hunc lutulentum, saepe ferentem
Plura quidem tollenda relinquendis.

Nil comis tragici mutat Lucilius Acci?

Orelli does, referring to the description 111
ι118 next Satire, vv. 30, sqq. (see below,
v. 65.) Accius was born a.c. 170, and was a
writer of tragedies, chiefly from the Greek,
but some ‘praetextatae-¹ Cicero calls him
“gravis et ingeniosus poeta'’ (pro Plane.
c. 24), “summus po'eta'' (pro Sextio, c. ¹
56). Quintilian' s judgment will be found
inthe noteonEp p.ii. l. 56. Horace
speaks elsewhere (A. P. 259) of‘ ‘Acci
nobilibus trimetris,” where, as in the
above E pistle, he is referring more to the
popular pjudgment than giving his own.
Gellius (xiii. 2) relates how he read to Pa.
ouvius one of his early productions (Atreus,
a tragedy), and that the old man said,
‘sonora quidem esse quae scripsisset et
grandim sed videri ea tamen sibi duriora
paullum et acerbiora.’¹ Accius acknowledged
it was so, but hoped tomend his style as
he grew older. Gellius finishae his account
of Roman authors (xvii. 21) with “Q.
Ennius et juxta Caecilius et Terentius ac
subinde et Pacuvius, et Pacuvio jam sene
Accius, clariorque tunc in poematis eorum
obtrectandis Lucilius.'' Porphyrion has a
note here, ‘⁴ facit autem hoc cum alias tum iu
tertio libro et nono et decimo Satirarum.”

de se loquitur non sic dicit quasi melior sit
illis poetis? ’which interpretation of Acron' s
—the true one no doubt—1 give because
some editors, including Doering and Hein-
dorf, make another question of this verse,
and translate it thus: “ When he speaks of
himself, is it not as one superior ιο those he
finds fault with ?’'——which is contrary to the
spirit of the passage altogether. Horace
seeks in Lucilius a precedent, not sor com-
mending himself, but only for noticing 111 a

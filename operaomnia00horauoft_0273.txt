'CARMINUM IV. 9.

Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
obliviones. Est animus tibi

Rerumque prudens et secundis

Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, et abstinens
Ducentis ad se cuncta pecuniae,

Consulque non unius anni

Sed quoties bonus atque fidus

J udex honestum praetulit utili,
Rejecit alto dona nocentium
Vultu, per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sua victor arma.

ertia’ (the ablative), aa is Horace meant
‘ inertia celata,' hidden through the neglect
osthepoeta. Butthereisnoneedfor
such a conjecture. The text is much better
as it stands on the authority os all the MSS.

31. eilebm] Many MSS. and editors have
¹aileri,¹ but ‘silebo' is equally well sup-
portedandreadsbctter Ithink. So C. i
12. 21 ε “ Neque te silebo, Hber.” Bent-
ley tuke- more credit than he is enti-
tled to for restoring that reading, since
Lambinus and most of the earlier editors
have it. His arguments in support of it
have no weight‚ and he is wrong in suppos-
ing ‘sileri’ to have been a late interpre-
tation, for Cruq uius’ commentator, whoever
he may have been, had that word before
him when he wrote thus: “Non eqo te:
non patiar tuam virtutem silentio obscu-
ran)

32. Totae tuos patiar labores] These
lines seem to have reference to the unpopu-
larity of Lollius in connexion with his
defeat, which appears to be alluded to in
the word ‘dubiis ’ below. He may also
have been the object of slander in respect
to his personal character, which Horace
here warmly defends. There seems to be
naother way of acoeunting sor the earnoet-
neas with which he declares his innocence
of the vice of avarioe, for instance, than to
suppose that fault had been laid to his

34.’ Bet uiuimus tibi]‘ Rerum prudentia'
is aknowledge of the world. The Scho-
liastscallit ‘ philosophia,’ and so it is, of the
mrest sort, the philosophy of common
sense and obseryation. “Cato multarum
rerum usum habebat'' (Cic. de A.m ii. 6)
¹expressos the same kind of experience.

‘Rectus' means ‘erect,' not stooping or
bowed down, as “Pana deos habuere rec-

tos” (C. iv, 4. 48). Fea quotes Boethius
(de Cous. i. 4) :-—·

‘⁸ Quisquis composito serenus aevo
Fatum sub pedibus dedit superbum ς
Fortunamque tuens utramque rectus
Invictum potuit tenere vultum.”

See also Ennius, quoted by Cicero (de Se·
nect. c. 6)ss ‘Quo nobis mentes, rectae quae
stare solebant Antehac, dementes sese
flexere viai!

37. abstinens—pecuniae,] For similar
Graedsms see C. ii. 9. 17. ιι.

39. consulque nen unius anni ,] Compare
C. iii. 2. 19. Lolliuswasoensulamc 733,
but Horace says that an upright judex' is al-

ways on a level with the highest magistrates,
and such ever was Lollius, besieged like
others with tennptations to corruption, but
msting them all, and so overooming the
enemiesg who encom him, and de-
livering himself by his virtue from their
calumnies. This 1 take to be the meaning
of ‘obstantes catervas,’ δια, though these
two stanzas are by no means free from ob-
scurity. Doering thinks Lollius was consul
when this was written. objections have been
raised to the construction of the sentence,
by which ‘ consul’ is referred back to ‘ani-
mus, ’ which is mere trifling. His heart
was the beart of a consul, which could
hardly have been exproesed more plainly
thau it is here. Lambinus, Cruquius, Bent-
ley, and others, adopt ⁴ et ’ aster ‘ utili’ and

‘vultu.’ Orelli says that all the exisfing
MSS. except oue omit the coujunction, and
he does so. Forcelliui does not notice the
use of‘ explicare’ in this passage. lt ia

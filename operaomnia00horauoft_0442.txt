HORATII FLACGI

Maxima formid03 nam fures dextra coercet ,
Obscoenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus3 5
Ast importunas volucres in vertice arundo

Terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis.

Huc prius angust-is ejecta cadavera cellis

Conservus vili portanda locabat in arca.

Hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum,

Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque nepoti:
Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum

more severe than Horace’s “incertus scam-
num faceretne Priapum maluit esse deum.”

Not much less in the same strain is that
address of Martial (viii. 40) 2—ss

“ Non horti neque palmitis beati
Sed rari nemoris, Priape, custos,
Ex quo natus es et potes renasci,
Fui-aces moneo manus repellas,

Et silvam domini focis reserves.
Si defecerit hoc et ipse lignum esss’

The figures of Priapus were generally busts
like the Hermae, but sometimes they were
full length of the kind Horace describes.
Usually they held a sickle or a club in
their right hand by way of frightening
thieves, and a wisp of straw, or something
of that sort, to frighten the birds. Priapus
also symbolized the fertility of nature in the
later mythology of the Greeks as well as
the Romans. In Agostini’s collection of
gems (part ii. pl. 13) there is one represent-
ing a sacrifice to Priapus, where he stands
at full length on a high pedestal, with a
thyrsus in one hand, resting on his shoulder.
The offerings are a goat’s head and fruits,
which a woman is laying on a rude altar,
while a man is bringing up a basket on his
head containing more fruit and ‘phalli,'
which formed a feature in the worship of
Bacchus as well as of Priapus. These two
were honoured alike as presiding, the one
over vineyards, the other over gardens : this
accounts for the thyrsus in the figure, which
is a combination of the two divinities.

6. importunas volucres] Virgil applies
the same epithet to destructive birds:
‘⁴ Obscoenaeque canes importunaeque volu-
cres ” (Georg. i. 470). Cruquius explains
the word thus: “ Quod sine ulla Dei reve-
rentia quovis tempore essent molestae. '’
The word is used with a variety os mean-
ings, to reduce which to one character
we must know more of its etymology
than Forcellini tells us on the authority
of Festus.

7. Huc prius anqustiis] Outside of the
walls in front of Mons Esquilinus lay the

Campus Esquilinus, in which were buried
the poorest of the people in ill-dag graves,
which had the name ⁴ puficuli,’ whether ss
the diminutive of ‘ putei,' or from the putre-
faction of the corpses and the stench themby
occasioned, Varro hesitates to decide. The
manner of their funeral is here stated with
painful satire. The poor wretch is neg-
lected by his master3 and a fellow slave,
out of his ‘peculiumss goes to the expense
of hiring (⁴ locabat ')‘ vespillones’ (common
corpse- -,bearers νεκροφόρους) to carry him
out on a bier to the public burial- ground.
where his corpse was ptossed naked into a

pit into which other corpses had been tossed ,

before. This scene could not have occurred
in all its particulars very often, since every
master was bound by law ω bury his slave,
and if any one did it for him he was entitled
to recover the eost of the funeral stom the
master of the slave (Dig. ll. 7. 31, quoted
in Dict. Ant. p. 874). The ¹ vilis arca’ was
called ‘ sandapila, ' whose narrow, dimen-
sions are referred to in an epigram of Mar-
tial (ii. 81), where he says of the stout
Zoilus :—
“ Laxior hexaphoris tua sit lectica licebit
Dum tamen ,haec tua sit, Zo'ile, sanda-
pila est.

And again, speaking of a mistress whose
extravagant demands were reducing her
lover to poverty (ix. 3),—

“ Octo Syris suffulta datur lectica ,puellam
Nudum sandapilae pondus amicus erit.”

Suetonius, at the end of his life of Domi-
tian, says, “ Cadaver ejus populari sanda·
pila per vespillones exportatum.”

11. Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque
nepoti .·] As to these persons, see note
above on S. i. 101. In consequence of their
extravagance Priapus foretells they will
come to a pauper's funeral. We need not

understand them as already dead and bui-iod

in the Esquiliae, as Comm. Cruq. qsays.

burial- -ground was 1000 feet m breadth and

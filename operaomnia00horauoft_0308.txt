HORATII FLAOOI

Aut herba lapathi prata amantis et gravi ”

Malvae salubres corpori,

Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,

Vel haedus ereptus lupo.

60

Has inter epulas ut juvat pastas oves
Videre properantes domum,
Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves

Collo trahentes languido,
Positosque vernas, ditis examen domus,

6⁵

Circum renidentes Lares !
Haec ubi locutus fenerator Alphius,
J am jam futurus rusticus,
Omnem redegit Idibus pecuniam,
Quaerit Kalendis ponere.

The ‘ attagen’ is usually said to be the
moor-fowl. Martial says it was one of their
most delicious birds (xiii. 61) :—

⁴⁴ Inter sapores fertur alitum primus
Ionicarum gustus attagenarum.’'

It is repeatedly mentioned by Aristophanes.
Aristotle, in his History of Animals, num-
bers it among κονιστικοὶ ὄρνιθες, birds
which do not fly high.

57. Aut herba lapathi] Both the ‘ lapa-
thus’ and the ‘ malva ' were gently pur-
gative. See Sat. ii. 4. 29 and Mart. x. 48.

“ Eiippteliilatturas ventrem mihi villica malvas

59. caesa Terminalibus] The Termi-
nalia took place in the early spring (23
February), about the time of lambing, and
lambs were offered to Terminus. Plutarch
says that sheep rescued from the jaws of the
wolf were thought to be better flavoured
than others. The thrifty would eat them
sor economy. That is the idea Horace
means to oonvey. Martial introduces the
same dish to make a plain meal (x. 48.

 

Una ponetur coenula mensa
Hoedus inhumani raptus ab ore lupi.”

Porphyrion explains Horace's meaning by
saying “ factus gratior 'ex perdit0.”
61. utjuvat] See v. 19, “ ut gaudet.'’

65. vernae, ditis examen domum] “ Tur--

baque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni ''
(Tibull. ii. l. 23). ‘Verna' was a slave
born in the owner’s house. There was a
hearth near which the images of the Lares
were placed, in the centre of the ‘an-ium:
the entrance-mom, and round it the slaves

had their supper. Columella (R. R. xi. 1.
19, quoted by Cruquius) says: ‘⁴ Consuescet
(villicus) rusticos circa Larem domini fo—
cumque familiarem semper epulari.” llar-
tial (iii. 58. 22) has :- ’

“ Cingunt serenum lactei focum vernae
Et larga festos lucet ad Lares sylva,”

which favours the notion that ‘ renidentes'
means shining by the light of the fite, al-
though Orelli says it does not. ⁴ Choerful'
is the sense. Rutgersius refers the wond to
‘ vernas,’ and Doering partly appi-oves. , 11:
includes both ‘ Lares' and ⁴ vernas! Tire
sense derived from J uvenal’s desoeiption
(xii. 88), “simulacra nitentia oerassf does
not suit this passage.

67. Haec ubi locutus] Mancinum, who
was an acute as well as learned⁴ man, sup-
poses Horace to mean, that on hearing him
declaim upon the charms of the country
the usurer determined to be a fal-mer, and
he understands ⁴ sum ' aster ‘ loeutus:
Though no doubt he is wrong, he saw that
ἓεὲἳιῗῑῖ ‘153ss ffasshssssssssi‘ssig‘iomfifflu'imii‘
Stephens notiees the same interpretation.
An usurer of this name is mentioned by
Columella (de R. R. i. 7. 2, quoted by 211
the Commentators) as an authority on the
subject of bad debts. ‘ Redigere ' (not
⁴ religere,' as the Scholiasta and some of
the older editors have it) is the techniml
word for getting in money out on loan, aud
⁴ ponere’ for putting it out, as καταβάλλειν,
βάλλειν, τιθέναι. The settling days at Rome
were the Kalends, Nones, and Ides. See
Cicero, Div. in Q. Caecil. 17; also in Verr-
act. ii. 1. l. c. 57), ⁴⁶ Nemo Rabonio moles-
tus est neque Kalendis Decembribus neque
Nonis neque Idibus.''

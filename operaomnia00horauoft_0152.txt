and power cannot remove care from the dwelling. Thea-nablum. why
do we aim at so much happiness in this short life, and run away from home? We

cannot fly from ourselves and mre. We should be cheerful sor the present, and not
expect perfect happiness. One man lives many days, another has few. Ι may have

opportunities of happiness which are denied to thee; and yet thou hast ample posses-
sicus, and 1 but a humble farm, a breath of the Grecian muse, and a contempt for the

vulgar.

l. patente] I have adopted Bentley's
termination, though nearly all the MSS.
have ⁴ patenti' (see note on C. i. 2. 2).
Servius, on Virgil (Georg. iv. 42), “Depren-
sis olim statio fidissima nautis,” says that
‘ deprensus' was a nautical term for a ship
overtaken by a storm. This, as well as the
weight of MS. authority, gives the prefer-
ence to ‘ prensus’ over ‘pressus,' which
several MSS. have, and Gesner approves.
¹ Prensus‚’ written with the usual mark
‘ presus,' would easily pass into ⁴ pressus ;’
and J ani says the copyists often interchange
these words. ‘In patenti' has been changed
into ⁴ impotenti,' a oommon epithet for the
winds and waves (see C. iii. 30. 3. Epod.
xvi. 62). But the MSS. and old editions
all have ‘in patenti‚’ either as one word or
two. The stoi-ms of the Aegean are men-
tioned C. iii. 29. 63 : ‘⁴ Tutum per Aegeos
tumultus‚” διο.

10. Summovet] This is the properword
to express the lictor's duty of clearingthe
way. The word ‘laqueatus’ is fully ex-
plained by Foreell.

14. calinum] See note on S. i. 3. 13.
‘ Cupido‚' when it refers to the love of
money, is always masculine in Horaoe.

17. jaculamur] See C. i. 2. 3, n.

18. Quid terras alio calentes] Virgil
has the same expression ι “ Ataeiue alio
patriam quaerunt sub sole jaoentemss'

19. Patriae—exeat] This is another
Graeciam, πατρίδος φυγάς. Ovid uses the
same construction (Met. ix. 409) : ‘⁴ Exsul
mentisque domusque.” There is a passage
in Lucretius (iii. 1071, sqq.)‚ which may
aptly be compared with this, where he com-
plains that men—

-“ Quid sibi quisque velit nes-cire et quaerere

CARMEN XXXII.

This ode has caused the commentatore a good deal of trouble. whether ‚it was meant
to be an introduction to some poem Horace wrote or intended to write on one of the
events of the day, or what sort of song he was asked for and by whom, are all questions
that have been freely discussed. The question turns in the first instance on the word
with which the ode begins. The Scholiasta read ‘ Poscimurss on which Acron's com-
ment is ‘ poscebatur dicta sua edere ς’ Porphyrion’s ‘ Exigitur a nobis ut canamus! But
a large number of MSS. have ‘ Posdmus: which Bentley adopts aster hmbinus md an
the older editions. (Cmquim, however, following his Blandinian MS„ reads ‘ Posdmurl)
With that reading the ode becomes a mere invocation of the Mune, which would mit any
poem or any subject. With ⁴ Poscimur,' which I have followed most of the modern,
editors in adopting, there is still no clue whatever to the occasion of the ode, and the
Scholiasts’ remarks do not help us. 1 see no grounds for Dillenbr.'s snpposition that 011
some important occasion Horace was asked to write a poem, and wrote this short ode to
deprecate such a demand, and to show that his muse was not suited to such themes-
There is nothing in it of that sort. 1 have no doubt ⁴ poscimur ’ is the true reading, md
it may mean merely that the poetic ‘ afflatus ¹ was on him. The abruptnessof the opening
favour-s that notion. See note on v. 2. ·

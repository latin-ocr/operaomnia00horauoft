Donec non alia magis 5
Arsisti neque erat Lydia post Chloen,
Multi Lydia nominis
Romana vigui clarior Ilia.
Me nunc Thressa Chlo’e regit
Dulces docta modos et citharae sciens,
Pro qua non metuam mori
Si parcent animae fata superstiti.
Me torret face mutua
Thurini Calais filius Ornyti,
Pro quo bis patiar mori
Si parcent puero fata superstiti.
Quid si prisca redit Venus
Diductosque jugo cogit aeneo,
Si flava excutitur Chloe
Rejectaeque patet janua Lydiae?
Quamquam sidere pulchrior
Ille est, tu levior cortice et improbo
Iracundior Hadria,
Tecum ¹vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.

5. alia] Some MSS. have ‘aliam‚’ which
Bentley adopts, thinking it more likely the
copyists would have omitted the ⁴ m ’ in con-

sequence of the same letter coming imme-
diately afterwards, than that they should
have inserted it. Orelli thinks just the re-
verse. Either construction is correct ,(888

g. 11. 4. 7, 11.). 011 “multi nominis,' see
i.36. 13.

12. Si parcent animae] Cic. ad Fam.
(xiv. 14);1ν “Vos meae carissimae animae
quam saepissime ad me scribite.'’ Since
⁴ metuam' here and ‘ patiar' below (v. 15)
are the present subjunctive, ⁴ parcent,' fol-
lowing those words, should, in strict Lati-
nity, be ‘ parcant! But the same construc-
tion occurs above (C. iii. 3. 7) 2-—

“ Si fractus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinae,”

where, however, some MSS. have ‘ illabetur)
Why Chloe should be 3 Thracian, and Orny-
tus a Sybarite (Thurium was formerly Sy-
baris) is not worth questioning. The reading
Cressa is properly rejected as harsh, and

Ornithi, which could only be derived from
ὄρνιθος. of which the penult is long. Both
seem to have got into the Scholiast& text
only through the error of transcribere.
‘¹ Cressa, Thraciass' is Acron’s note in As-
censius’ text.

17. prisca] Forcellini gives other 111-
stances of this use of‘ priscus, 'where‘ ⁴
tinus' is more usual. ‘JDeductos the read-
ing of the oldest Berne and 0118 Leipzig
MS. quoted by Jani, could only be taken
with jug0‚’‘ and signify ‘withdrawn from
the yoke,’ which might be admitted by 3
double construction of ‘ jugo’ with ⁴ deduc-
tos’ and ‘ cogit! I have given 1118 common
reading, but the other hardly desei-ves Orel-
li' s strong condemnation.

19. ementitur] Bentley understands‘ j-a -
nua’ from the next 11118, yfollowing Ain-on,
who says, “Excutitun pro expelliturl’
Orelli says it is a metaphor taken from a
horse that throws its rider. The English

“cast off'' expresses the meaning best.
On the meaning of‘ improbus' as a word
expressing‘ excess, ’see below (C. iit24. 62).

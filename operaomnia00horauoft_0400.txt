HORATII FLACOI

Quis manus insudet volgi Hermogenisque Tigelli:
Nec recito cuiquam nisi amicis, idque coactus,

Non ubivis coramve quibuslibet.
Scripta foro recitent sunt multi quique lavantes z
Suave locus voci resonat conclusus.

in which case the titles of the books for
sale within were hung upon the columns
(‘pi1ae’) 111 front. Horace alludes to this
when he says (A. P. 372)z “Mediocribus
esse poetis Non Dii. non homines, uon cou-
cessere columnae‚'’ which means that in-
different poets would not be patronised by
the booksellers. Martial advises his friend
Lupercus ιο go and buy a copy of his Epi-
grams at the shop of one Atrectus, which
he describes thus z

‘⁴ Contra Caesaris est forum taberna,
Scriptis postibus hinc et inde totis,
Omnes ut cito perlegas poetas.''(i 118)

The price of his book he says was five
‘ denarii’ (about three and sixpence).
How much he had then published does
not appear. Becker (Gallus, Exc. on the
Booksellers) assumes that it was the first
book, containing 119 Epigrams, which
he im plies would be very cheap at that
rice3 pbut as this Epigram is 0118 of the
lla, Becker must be mistaken. ‘’Habeat

73. Nec recito cuiquam] Some MSS„
known only to Lambinus‚had ‘nec recitem,'
which Bentley adopts to maintain unifor-
mity in the verbs ‘ sim,' ⁴ habeat,‘ and ‘ reci-
tem! All other known MSS. have ‘nec
recit0‚' excepting four of Lambinus’, which
had ‘ non recit0,' the received reading 111 his
day. From one Oxford MS. (Magdalen)
Bentley reads ‘quicquam' for ‘cuiquam,’
the reading of all the other MSS. Τ118
example said to have been set by Pollio
(C. ii. 1, Introduction), of reading his works
to a circle of friends for their criticism and
amusement before they were published, may
have already beguu to be imitated by other
writers. The practice grew to be 811 111-
tolerable nuisance in the course of time, as
we guther, among others, from Persius (S. i.
15, sq q.) Juvenal (i. l, sqq. 3v1i. 403 xiii.
32),Martia1 (ii. 27, &c.). Persons who had
money and dabbled in literature inflicoed
their productione upon their clients and

others whom they bribed ιο listen aud ap-
plaud them. The author οῙ ι118 Dislogue
de Oratore, attributed to Tadtus (c. 9),
speaks with contempt of one Saleius Bassus,
a poetaster, mentioned by Juveml (vii. 80),
who went about praying people ιο listen ιο
his recitatious, and went to the expense of
hiring and preparing a room for the pur-
pose. But if Pollio was the originator of
this practice, as he is said to have been, it
could hardly yet have grown 111ιο ι110 sys-

‘ scholae ’ were spaces sor people to sit or
walk on round the baths generally, not

bath of small dimensions attached ιο the
principal hot-batha (see Becker’s Gallus,

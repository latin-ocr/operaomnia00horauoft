GARMINUM ΙΙ. 13. 113

Num tu quae tenuit dives Achaemenes,
Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes
Permutare velis crine Licymniae,

Plenas aut Arabum domos?
Dum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula 25
Cervicem aut facili saevitia negat,
Quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,

Interdum rapere occupet.

CARMEN XIII.

A.n.c. 728 (ἓ).

The date of this ode is fixed with some confidence by Franke A.u.c. 728, by Dillenbr.
729, because it was written the year before C. iii. 8. (See Introduction to that ode, and
111. 29.) The invitation to Maecenas was written evidently for the first anniversary of the
accident referred to in this ode. Lachmann (Ep. to Franke, p. 240) considers it to be one
of Horaoe’s earliest, in consequence of the metre of v. 27, 44 Alcaee, plectro dura navis ;'’
and for similar reasons he puts C. iii. 8 at an early date. But such conclusions have been
already notioed. There is nothing in them, as 1 believe, whatever. The latter part of

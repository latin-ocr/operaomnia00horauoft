67. Metello] Q. Caecilius Metellus,
who had the cognomen Macedonicus given
him for his successes against Andriscus, the
pretender to the throne of Perseus, was a
political opponent of Scipio3 but it need
not be supposed it was on this account that
Lucilius satirized him. Horace’s way of
mentioning the subject is against that sup-
position. He means to say Scipio aud
Laelius were not offended at Lucilius' wit,
nor feared it might turn upon themselves,
when they saw him attack Metellus. But
if Lucilius had done so because he was an
enemy of Scipio, that alone would be a suffi-
cient guarantee against his exercising his
wit in an offensive way upon his friend,
and Horace's argument would mean no-
thing. And Metellus’ opposition to Scipio
in public life was conducted without acri-
mony, as Cicero says (de Off. i. 25. 87),

“fuit inter P. Africanum et Q. Metellum
sine acerbitate dissensio? (See the notice
of his life· ιιι Dict. Biog. ‘Metellusss No. 5.)

68. Lupo] Who gLupus was is not
certain. His name appears in many of the
fragments of Lucilius. and Persius writes
(S. i. 114), “Secuit Lucilius urbem Te,
Lupe, te Muci, et genuinum fregit in illis.”
The Scholiasta speak of him as P. Rutilius
Lupus, who was consul A.u.c. 664. But
Lucilius died, according to the most pro-
bable account, in asi-c. 651, and in one of
his fragments speaks of Lupus as dead3
and evenis we suppose that Lucilius lived
longer than the year 664, his attacks on Ru-
tilius Lupus could not well have begun ιιι the
life- time of Scipio, who died forty yyears
before the consulship of Rutilius. Τὴθ
most probable person, ¹),therefore as Torren-
tius suggests, is L. Cornelius Lentulus
Lupus, who was consul ΛΑΜ). 598. What
he had done to provoke Lucilius’ satire we
do not know, but Cicero has preserved a
verse of his in which Lupus is mentioned.
‘⁶ Quid de sacrilegis, quid de impiis per-

Quidquid sum ego, quamvis
Infra Lucili censum ingeniumque, tamen me

jurisque dicimus?” asks cicero, and he
proceedsz

“ Tubulus si Lucius unquam,
Si Lupus, aut Carbo, aut Neptuni filius,

ut ait Lucilius, putasset esse Deos, tam
perjurus aut tam impurus fuisset .’'’ where,
if Lucilius' verse was in accordance with
Cicero’s argument, Lupus is classed with
the perjured and profligate.

Atqui Primores populu] ⁴ Atqui,’ which
is a form of ‘ at quin,' means ‘but he did,
did he not? ¹ ⁴ Tributiml throughout
all the tribes: he attacked the optimates
and plebeians, and all without distinction.
‘ Aequus ’ means ¹ favourable to!

72. Virtus Scipiadae] On this form
see above, v. 17. See also S. i. 2. 32, ιι.
ou the expression ‘virtus Sdpindness. and
compare Juv. iv. 81, “Venit et Crispi ju-
cunda senectus. ” Laelius, as above men-
tioued, had the cognomen Sapiens given
him, and any one who reads Cicero' s
treatise that bears his name will understand
Horace’ s epithet ‘mitis-⁹ It would have
been worth while to have been present at
the scene Cruquius’ Scholiast relatas of
Laelius running round the dinner-table,
and Lucilius pursuing him with a napkin to
flog him. Lucilius was born a-u.c. 606,
and Scipio died A.u.c. 625. Hewas there'·
fore but a boy when he thus played with
these friends; and if, as Horace's language
implica, he wrote satires in Scipio's life-
time, they were probably the mere intem-
perate sallies of youth. But Horace may
be mistaken. Τ1ιε fare of these great men
was of the simplest kind. (See note on
S. i. 6. 115.

75. Infra) Lucili censum] Horace had
before intimatcd (v- 34, ιι.) that he, a
poor man' s son, born in a provincial town,
was not to be compared with Lucilius, a
Roman citizen, who was rich and had a
fine house in tlie Forum.

Quid accidit? Cur dira barbarae minus
Venena Medeae valent?

Atqui nec herba nec latens ιιι asperis
Radix fefellit me locis.

capable of various renderings. Orelli says
she had smeared the couch he slept οιι with
drugs, to make him forget all women but

My own opinion is divided between this
interpretation and the following: ‘ he is
sleeping on his drugged couch, in forgetful-
ness of all women,' including herself, as if
she suddenly had seen him in that position.
I incline on the whole to Orelli’s version.

the later Suburra, which was not one of tha

Those who are not satisfied with either of
these interpretations will find a new one in
nearly every commentator they may con-
sult. The Scholiasts' notion that Canidia
was a seller of perfumes has a little more
show of foundation (in v. 59, 60) than the
same as applied to Virgilius (C. iv. 12,
Introduction); but it is in all probability
derived from this passage only. Acron' s
reading, ‘Jsuburbanae in v. 58, shows the
cantion with which the Scholiasta are to be
followed. Inv. 60 the oldest MSS. vary
between‘ laborarint' and‘ laborarunt, and
it is hard to decide between them. Both
have an appropriate sense. the one de-

the other that she never could have

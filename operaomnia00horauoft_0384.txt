Cum mea compenset vitiis bona 3 pluribus hisce

Si volet : hac lege in trutina ponetur eadem.

Peccatis veniam poscentem reddere rursus.

Denique, quatenus excidi penitus vitium irae
Cetera item nequeunt stultis haerentia, cur non
Ponderibus modulisque suis ratio utitur, ac⁰res
Ut quaeque est ita suppliciis delicta coercet?

Si quis eum servum patinam qui tollere jussus

Semesos pisces tepidumque ligurierit jus
In cruce suffigat, Labeone insanior inter

tators. The Scholiasts interpret ‘ cum ’ as
a preposition. Some editors take it as a
conjunction. Bentley, Heindorf, Orelli,
and Dillenbr. follow the Scholiasts, 1 think
with good reason. Fea, Meineke, Duentzer
are on the other side. The last says with
much confidem-e that Horace would have
put the substantive next to ⁵ cum ' if he had
meant it for a prepositiou ; but he probably
preferred bringing together the words that
are opposed to one another, ⁴ vitiis ' and
⁴ bona! There is no more abruptness
arising out of the absence of a conjunction
between ⁸ bona' and ‘ pluribus' than the
character of the discourse renders natural.
Heindorf takes ‘hac lege' with‘ amari 31
volet! 1 do not see any particular objec-
tiou to that punctuation3 but the common
way is at least as good. ‘Compensare’ is
a legal term. ‘Compensatio' is a‘ set· off!
See Smith’s Dict. Ant.

72. trutina] This word applies equally
to the ‘libra,’ a balance with two scales
(¹ lances ’), and to the ‘statera,’ or 31331-
yard, both of which were in common use
among the Romans. ‘In trutina ponetur
eadem,’ he shall be weighed in the same
balance, is another, but not very exact way
of saying, he shall be tried by the same
standard, his character shall be estimated
in the same way.

74. iqnoscet] The MSS. vary
the future indicative and the present sub-
junctive. Perhaps the future is more after
Horace’s style.

as (C. iii. 24. 30) the vice of passion and all
other vices that cleave to-us fools cannot be
entirely eradicated! An were fools with the

of the editions, and all the MSS„ are said
to have two ‘r’s ’ς and Heindorf, on their
authority, adopts that way of spelling the
word. Mr. Long (cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 76)
prefers the sing le‘ r.' ‘Pisces patinarii'
were boiled {ishg served up with sauce in 811

open dish. See Plautus (Aaim' 1. 3. 26, sqq.)· .

“ Quasi piscis itidem est amator lenae: ne-
quam est nisi recens
Is habet succum, is suavitatem, 311111
quovis pacto condias
Vel patinarium vel assum; vorsus qno

82. In cruce suffiyat] Cicero has the

place he has the construction‘ ‘damnatis
crucem servis fixeras.” See ΜΓ. Long’s
note on the first of the above
Dict. Ant„ art. ‘ Crux,' for an account of
the punishment by crucifixion. ’

Labeone insanior] The Scholiasta una-
nimously speak of ‘Labeo' as M. An-
tistius Labeo, a lawyer of eminence, who
had attacked Augustus very freely, and
was therefore set down 83 8 madman by
Horace to please his patron. Marcus Labeo
was the son of Quintus, and both were
eminent jurists. The father was of the
party of Brutus and Cassius, was present at
Philippi, and put himself to death after the
battle. Tacitus (Anu. 111. 75) writing of
the year Α. υ. c. 775, about sixty years aster

EPISTOLARUM Ι. 14.

Nec vicina subest vin'um praebere taberna

Quae possit tibi, nec meretrix tibicina, cujus

Ad> strepitum salias terrae gravis: et tamen urges
J ampridem non tacta ligonibus arva bovemque
Disjunctum curas et strictis frondibus exples;
Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,

⁴ Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato.

Nunc age quid nostrum concentum dividat audi.
Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli,
Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,
Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni,

Coena brevis juvat et prope rivum somnus in hcrba;

Nec lusisse pudet sed non incidere ludum.

the farm he did not think worthy of the
name. That Horace made his own wine,
and that it was not too bad to put before
Maecenas, we know from C. i. 20. Pepper
the ancients must have got through some
channel from India. ‘ Thus ' 01· ⁴ tus' (see
Porcell.) ⁸ olibanum,’ which is a gum resin,
attracted from a tree called now the Bos-
wellia Thurifera, was brought chiefly from
Arabia. See Virgil (Georg. i. 57) ι “ India
mittit‘ebur, molloe sua tura Sabaei.''

25. meretrioe libionem] As to ‘tibial
aee C. iii. 19. 19; iv. 15. 30. It was
played by women as well as men.

26. et tamen τιν-903] This is said with a
sort of mock compassion: ‘and yet, poor
man! (though you have none of these com-
forts to help you on your way) you have to
go on turning up the rough soil, feeding
the oxen, looking out for floods, and all
that) ‘ Jampridem non tacta ’ implies that
Horace's property had been neglected be-
fore it came into his possession. Maecenas
had probably never resided there, and per-
haps he had not been long owner of it
(however he got it, which is not known),
when he gave it to Horace. One of the
duties the ⁴ villicus' had to attend to was
looking to the banks of the river (Digentia),
which it was apt to burst or overflow when
the rains came down heavily. Horace has
‘ docere ’ again in this connexion (A. P. 67):
‘⁴ Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus
amnis Doctus iter melius.”

31. quid nostrum concentum dividat]
⁸ What disturbs our harmony,' or prevents
us from agreeing in opini0n; which is,
that whereas 1 can look back upon my
pmt enjoyments with pleasure, and am glad
to quit them now that my time of life re-
quires it to retire to the country, where 1

am free from jealonsies and vexations, you
are longing to get back to your former lise,
and give up the country, which many a poor
slave in the town envioe you. So the ox
enviae the horse, and the horse envies the
ox, but my judgment is that each should do
the work he is best fitted sor.

32. tenues decuere toque] The toga was
generally made of a thick woollen cloth,
but there were lighter and finer sorts for
summer. These were called ⁸ rasae,’ be-
cause the nap was clipped close. See Mar-
tial (ii. 85) :—

“Dona quod aestatis misi tibi mense De-
cembri
Si quereris,rasam tu mihi mitte togam.”

‘Nitidi capilli ’ refers to the anointing of
the head at meals. The Romans in their
degenerate days carried the use of perfumoe,
111 the shape of fragrant oils and ointments
for the body and hair, to great lengths.
Scipio oounted the man a coxcomb and
something worse, “qui quotidie unguen-
tatus adversus speculum ornetur, cujus
supercilia raduntm-ss’ &c. (Gell. vii. 12.)

33. immunem Cinarae] Though Cinara
loved money, and he had none to give, yet
she was fond of him. As to this woman,
see C. iv. l. 3, 11.

34. media de luce] ⁴ Soon after noon ’
(see S. ii. 8. 3, n.). It need not be taken
too literally. Tbeir'drinking was not un-
commonly earried on from three or four
o 'clock till past midnight, but with idle

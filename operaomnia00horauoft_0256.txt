226 HORATII FLAGGI

mention of his part in the 1181· had he joined it when the ode was written. Bentley's
notion that Drusus only attacked and defeated the Vindelici and Tiberius the Raeti is ·
ridiculous. He is led to it by v. 18 of this ode and 10 sqq. of C. 14, and by the state-
ment of Velleius (ii. 95), “ Uterque divisis partibus Raetos Vindelicosque aggressi,” which
merely means that they divided their forces, and attacked the tribes in different quarters,
as Livy (xliv. ll) says of the taking of Cassandrea, “Divisis partibus oppugnare adorsi
praetor et Eumenes.’' Τ118 two tribes and the minor tribes connected with them were united
in one 1888118, and the idea of the Vindelici being attacked in or near the ωτι-1101188 of the
Raeti (¹⁴ Raetis sub Alpibus '’), while the Raeti themselves looked on and waited, 88 Jeui

says, for Tiberius’ arrival, is absurd. Ι 8111 surprised 11181 Franke adopts this notion on
a literal interpretation of Horace's words.

ARGUMENT.
Like the young eagle just darting on its prey, or the young lion fresh from its dam, was
Drusus when he met the rude Vindelici, and made them feel what hear-ts¹ could do

trained under the eye of Augustus. The 111-818 give birth to the breve. The 81881· and
- the horse have the blood of their sires, and the eagle gives not birth to the dove. But
education brings out the seeds of virtue. What Rome owes to the Nerones let the
Metaurus witness, and the day which saw Hasdrubal defeated and drove the clouds and
the fierce African from Latium. Our strength has grown and our gods have returned
from that day, and Hannibal was foroed to cry, ‘⁴ As the deer might pursue the wolf we
are pursuing those we should fly. Like the shorn osk they gain strength with every
blow, as the Hydra or the monsters of Thebes. Sink them in the deep, they riae more
glorious than ever, and overthrow their victor in his strength. No more shall 1 send
messengers of victory to Carthage31'allen, fallen are our hopes, and our fortune, for

Hasdrubal· 18 gone. ν’ The hand of a Claudius prospers, for Jove and his own sagecity
deliver him from danger.

QUALEM ministrum fulminis alitem,

1. Qualem] The apodosis of this long
opening (which however 881118 power 88 11
proceeds) is to be found in the sixteenth
verse. The best way to render it will be by
changing the cases in ‘ministrum’ and
‘ juventas :' ⁴ 88 11181 bird, the minister of
the thunderbolt, by the impulse of youth
from its nest is driven, and by the breezes
of spring is taught, ’ &c. Virgi ‘l calls the
eagle‘ ‘Jovis armiger’ ’(Aen. v. 255), which
Pliny (N. H. x. 3, 4)saysishisconven-
tional title. Pindar calls him ἀρχὸς οἰω-
νῶν (Pyth. i. 7), βασιλεὺς οἰωνῶν (01.
13. 21). ‘'Vaga as an epithet applied to

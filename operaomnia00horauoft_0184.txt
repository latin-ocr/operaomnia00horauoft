'154 HORATII FLAOGI

put away his wife and his children3 and fixed his eyes upon the ground; strengthened
the wavering minda of the fathers3 and departed among weeping friends a noble

exile. And though he knew the tormenta that awaited him, he put aside his troops of

friends as calmly as if he were going down to his home at Venafrum or Tarentum.

OAmo Tonantem credidimus J ovem
Regnare: praesens divus habebitur -
Augustus adjectis Britannis
Imperio gravibusque Persis.
Milesne Crassi conjuge barbara 5
Turpis maritus vixit et hostium,
Pro curia inversique mores !
Consenuit socerorum in armis
Sub rege Medo Marsus et Apulus,
Anciliorum et nominis et togae 10
Oblitus aeternaeque Vestae,
Incolumi Jove et urbe Roma?

1. Caelo Tonantem] Orelli does right
to take ‘regnare ' with ⁴ caelo,’ making ‘ To-
nantem ' absolute. ‘ Credidimus ’ has the
common force of the aorist. ⁴ Praesensss
which Dillenbr. takes in the sense noticed
on C. i. 35. 2, is obviously ‘ praesens in ter-
ris,’ as opposed to ‘ caelo!

3. adjectis] This means ⁴ when he shall
have added. ' It cannot mean. as some under-

stand it, who place the date of the ode after
‘the recovery of the standards from Phraates,

‘because he has added) That would be a
direct assei-tion that Augustus had invaded
and subdued Britain, which he never did,
though Strabo says (iv. p. 138) that many of
the native chiefs had sent to offer their
territories to the acceptance of the Romans,
οἰκείαν σχεδὸν παρεσκεύασαν τοῖς Ῥω-
μαίοις ὅλην τὴν νῆσον. Horace’s object
seems to be to divert men’s attention from
the Parthian prisoners and past defeat to
new objects of hope and ambition‚ under
the guidance of Augustus.

5. Milesne Crassi] It was about twenty-
eight years since the disastrous campaign of
Crassus, when about 10,000 Roman soldiers,
and several eagles, were left in the hands of
the Parthians. Orelli says Horace does not
allude to M. Antonius' losses in the same
quarter eighteen years afterwards, partly
because it would have been indelicate to-
wards Augustus, and partly because of his
affection for his son L. Antonius.

-— conjuye barbara— maritus] Ovid
uses this construction (Heroid. iv. 134),3

“Et fas omne facit fratre marita soror!

Vix-gil exclaims with the same horror of
Antonius, “Sequiturque (nefas) Aegyptia
conjux' '(Aen. viii. 688). The disgracelay
in their intermarrying with those who not
only had not‘ connubium’ with Rome, but
were her enemies.

7 . Pro curia inversique mores Ι] Orelli
gizzyrsejproli ‘gssgssggirgnsssmggz inmizdignafi-
according to circumstances. It is follow
by the nominative or accusative. In uie
common exclamation ‘¹ pro deum hominum-
que fidem !’' the accusative is always-used.
(See the explanation of that phrase in Mr.
Long' s note on Cic. Divin. in caecil. 3.)

3. in armw] Jani quotes one MS.
which has‘ arvis) This reading Bentley
adopts after Tan. Faber, and Heinsius. But
there is nothing to prevent our snpposing
the Roman prisoners served' m the Parthian
armies. As slaves they would be forced to
do so, and they might do it willingly, aa
Labienus did, who was not a prisoner. It

is Horace’s purpose at least to make it ap- ‘

pear they did so.
10. Aue-iliorum] This genitive, from
⁶ ancile.' is anomalous. Forcellini points
out a similar irregularity in¹ ⁴ Saturnaliorum,’
and Orelli adds ⁴ sponsaliorum! Horace
collecta the most distinguished objecta of a
Roman's reverence, his name, his citizen-
ship (togae), the shield of Mars only to be
lost, and the fire of Vesta only to be extin-
guished, when Rome should perish. Florus
(iv. ll. 3) says of M. Antonius, that hewas

‘patriae nominis togae fascium oblitus.”

HORATII 111.ΑοοΙ

Ηο0 amat et laudat. “ Matronam nullam ego tango?

Ut quondam Marsaeus, amator Originis ille,

9111 patrium mimae donat fundumque laremque,
‘⁴ Nil fuerit mi,” inquit, “ 011111 uxoribus unquam 011α115.” ,

Verum est cum mimis, est cum meretricibus, unde

Fama malum gravius quam res trahit.
Personam satis est, non illud quidquid ubique

Officit evitare. ²

Rem patris oblimare, malum 051 ubicunque.

Est in matrona, ancilla, peccesne togata?
Villius in Fausta Sullae gener, 1100 1111501· 1100

Nomine deceptus, poenas dedit usque superque

9110111 satis est, pugnis caesus ferroque petituS,
Exclusus fore eum Longarenus foret intus.
Huic si mutonis verbis mala tanta videntis

Diceret haec animus :

Magno prognatum deposco consule cunnum

Quid responderet? “ Magno patre nata puella 0515.”

55. Marsaeus, amator Oriqinis] Origo,
the mima, is referred to above (v. 2, n..)
Of Marsaeus, her lover, we know nothing
even from the Scholiasts. As Estre observes,
the name is 1101 Latin. It appears to be a
fictitious name.

62. oblimare‚] Forcellini derives this
from ‘lima,’ and rendere it to waste or
wear away. The word does 1101 000111· 10
11115 sense elsewhere. Its more probable
derivation is from ‘limus,' and its signi-
fication to bury in the mud. ‘'Ubicunque
means ‘wherever you do it!

63. aneilla peccesne toycam] While
women of birth wore the ‘'stola and

‘instita’ mentioned above (v. 29), freed-
women wore the‘ stola’ without the‘ in·
stita‚' and ‘meretrices' wore a ‘toga' in-
stead of a ⁴ stola,’ which explains the text.

‘Ancilla' is a female slave, and I do not
think Orelli 15 right in taking it with‘ to-
gata.¹ There are three persons, 1110*ωο-
trona,' the ‘ancilla,’ and 111οΗ108010 or

‘meretrixss Cruquius’ Scholiast relates that
ladies divorced for adultery were compelled
to exchan ge the‘ stola' for the‘ tog 0, ’the
only difference between them and common
prostitutos being that they wore a white,
while the latter wore a dark- coloured

‘toga’ This is confirmed by v. 36, and
Martial, ii. 39: —

‘⁴ Coccina famosae donas et ianthina
ἯΞῖῗῘι-ξωςυω meruit munera? mitte
gam.

Also‘ ‘matrisque togatae filius” (Mart. vi.
64. 4). See Becker’s Gallus (1.0. on v. 29).

64. Villius in Fausta Sullae ymen]
The preposition is here used as in Tacitus
(Ann. iii. 24), ** D. Silanus in nepti Augusti
adulter. '’ Fausta was the daughter of Sulla,
and a woman of infamous character, like
her mother Metella (see 8. 11. 2. 239, n..)
The husband of Fausta was Annius Milo,

and the Scholiast Acron say s that Villius· 15

put for Annius, as Malthinus for Maecenas ’

(500 above, v. 25), Licinia for Terentia (500
C. ii. 12, Introduction). But, as Bentley
rightly observes, Horace is not speaking of
husbands here. He adds also, that if any
name were to be supposed concealed under
Villius it would be Fulvius, for Macrobius
(Sat. 11. 2) relates that Fausta had a lover
of that name. Cicero (Α11 Fam. 11. 6) speaks
of 0110 Villius, an infimata friend of Milo' 5.

Horace calls him ironicall) Sulla’s son· in-

law, because of his intimacy with his
daughter. Longarenus may be any body.
The Scholiasts’ notion that Milo was
meant is absurd. ¹ Fore ' is the ablativo of
‘fotiel

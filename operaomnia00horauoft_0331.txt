EPODON LIBER, 11.

Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti 5
Inachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.

Heu me, per Urbem—nam pudet tanti mali—

6. Inachia] This is another of those
names from the Greek which Horace in-
variably adop ts in his merely poetical com-
fflgs, stiffi Ibelievethis odetobe (stgi

by one of the editors, and is supporiied by
the double construction with‘ ardere‚’ but
the MSS. are nearly all in favour of the
ablative.

honorem decutit] This expression is
used by virgil, who either borrowed it from
Horace, or from some common original

Θεοῖς. ii. 404): “Frigidus et silvis Aquilo
honorem. ” Some of course will
lave it that Horace copied virgil, and
therefore that this ode was written after the
publication of the Georgica, which is fixed
too confidently in A.t1.c. 724. See C. i.
17. 16 : “ Ruris honorum opulenta.’'

(See For-cell.)

13. meree-andus deus] When Horace
means to discourage hrawling over wine, he
callsBacchus‘ verecundus’ (C.' 1. 27. 3). The
bost works of artreproeent this god as young
and effeminately beautiful, with longhair like
Apollo, as the emblem of eternas youth. It
is a coar-se modern notion to reproeent him
as ι j011y round- faoed boy, or a drunken
sot. This character belongs to Silenus,
who is always drunk. “We have readily
retained thatys idea of this attendant of Bac-
chus in our northern drinkingpart of the
world, and so have mixed up the youth of
Bacchus with the plumpness and sottishneas
of Silenus; and to finiah all, instcadof an
asswesethimusually „uideam”
(Spence, Polymetis, p. 131, fol. edit). 1
may take this opportunity of adding to the
note on C. ii. 19. 30, that Bacchus had
horns assigned him as the son of Juppioer
Ammon, called Corniger, and that Alex-
ander took this emblem because he too
affected to be the son of Ammon, and
brother of Bacchus. “Eodem nempe quo
frater Bacchus instituto; cui ideo cornua
adscribit Diodorus (lib. iii. p. 2⁰6) quod
Cornigeri Ammonis aeaet silius” (
de Numism. Dissert- vii.). ἐβούλετο δὲ καὶ

ιι..) Βιι1 there canbe no doubt that he who
first putanactorupon the stage,ifhe, as most
suppose, gave him various parts to sustain,
must have employed masks suited to the
different characters. There were symbolical
masksfordiffeoentagoeanddasses,and
there were descriptive masks for different
personS, representing peculiarities by which
they would be known. Gellius (v. 7) derives
the word from‘ per-sono,' conceiving that>
they were contrived so as to assist the
voice. But that etymology will not do, if
it were only for the quantity of ‘soum'

Miiller says, “originated in the mte for
mumming and disguisoe of all sorta preva-
lent at the Bacchic festivals. They not
only conoealed the individual features of
well-known actors and enabled the spec-
tators entirely to forget the performer in
his part, but gave to his whole aspect that

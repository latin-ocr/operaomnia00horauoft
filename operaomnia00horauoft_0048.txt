18 HORATII FLAOGI

τῇ θεῷ καὶ ταῖς καλάνδαις ἐστεφανωμέναι αἱ γυναῖκες μυρσίνῃ λούονται. The question
whether April was so named from ἅφρος 18 honour of Venus, or from ‘ aperio ' asopening v
the pores of the earth, is here decided in favour of the goddess, and so by Ovid, Fast. iv:
61, sqq„ but the latter is the more probable derivation. The 8110181118 were bad etymo·
logists.

ARGUMENT.

Τ118 winter is thawing3 the spring is returning3 the ships are being launched ; the herds
quit their stalls and the ploughman his fireside, and the meadows are no longer white
with frost. Venus and the Gracae are leading the dance, and the Cyclops’ forge is
burning. Let us bind the head with myrtle or the earth's first flowers, and 88011608
8 lamb or kid to Pan. Death calls on rich aud poor alike. Life is short, O Sentius!
and our hopes we must contract. The grave awaits thee, aud when there no more
shalt thou preside at feast or sigh for the fair young Lycidas.

SOLVITUR acris hiems grata vice veris et Favoni,
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas,

Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus aut arator igni ;
Nec prata canis albicant pruinis.

J unctaeque Nymphis Gratiae decentes

Alterno terram quatiunt pede, dum graves Cyclopum
Volcanus ardens urit officinas.

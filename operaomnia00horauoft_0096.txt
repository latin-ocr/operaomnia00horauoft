CARMEN XXIX.

In the year of the city 730 an army was sent into Arabia Felix by Augustus under
Aelius Gallus, who was governor of Egypt. The force chiefly consisted of troops stationed
in that province (Strabo, xvii. ι Γάλλος Αἴλιος μέρει τῆς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ φρουρᾶς εἷς τὴν
Ἀραβίαν ἐμβαλὼν, nea-A.) · but the prospect of wealth the expedition held out, from tho
indefinite knowledge then possessed of the country, atu-acted young mem at Rome and
induced, it would seem, Iccius, a man of studious habits, to join it. The expedition was
attended with nothing but disaster, and the greater part of the force perished. But lodus
survived‚ and we find Horace writing to him a few years later as Agrippa's mvn-d in
Sicily (Epp. i. 12). Beyond this nothing is known of Iccius. Much has been said about
his being avaricious, and it will be found that that is the opinion of the author of his life
in the Biographical Dictionary usually referred to in these notes ς who says, that both in
this ode and the epistle “ Horace reprehends pointedly but delicately ixi-Iccius an inor-
dinate desire for wealth.” I do not think this idea would have presented itself to so
many minds if the Scholiasts had not made such remarks aa these ε “ Ad ledum ouibit
quem miratur philosophiae intermisso studio repente se ad militarem vitam centulam
cupiditate divitiarum.’'—“ Parsimoniam laudat cum mordacitate ” (Acron). “ Per quod
videtur concupiscere divitias Arabum.’'—“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui per svn-iem
philosophiae studium militia mutavit '’ (Porphyrion). Such remarks prove nothing tud
throw no light upon Horace’s meaning, of which we must judge for ourselven. Tho
point is not worth discussing as respects the unknown Iccius; but the character os tho
ode is lost in this view of it. It is a piece of good-temperati jocular- irony, of which the
point lies in the man of books going forth as a conqueror ω subdue fierce nationsumamed
before, and to return laden with the spoils of the East. Iccius may have beenof a rootless
character and not easily satisfied with his position, if we may judge by the langnage of
the epistle; but that scarcely affecte the spirit of this ode, in which there does not appear
to be any thing serious expressed or intended. Later times have seen young and clxiv-lma
men hastening to an El Dorado in ‚expectation of wealth and distinction, and finding

nothing but disappointment, and such appears to have been the case on the occasion of ,

this expedition into Arabia.

Jacobs has discussed these two poems in his Lect. Venusinae, Art. i., reprintsd stom
the Rhein. Mus. 1828. As the expedition was some time preparing, it is not cleu· whether
this ode was written A.u.c. 730, the year of the expedition, or a year or two earlier.

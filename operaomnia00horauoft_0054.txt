24 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN VII.

Munatius Plancus, who followed Julius Caesar bothin Gaul and in his war with Pompey,
aster Caesar’s death attached himself to the republican party, but very soon asterwards
joined Augustus3 then followed Antony to the east, and A.u.c. 722, the year before
Actium, joined Augustus again. It is supposed that about this time, perhaps at the
suggestion of Augustus, who was anxious to secure Plancus and to keep him from
leaving Italy, Horace wrote him this ode while his mind was perplexed and he was per-
haps meditating retirement from Rome to Greece.

Ι think all this is very doubtful, and with Estre (p. 308) Ι cannot but think it uncer-
tain whether this Plancus is intended at all. It may have been his son, who is probably
the Munatius referred to in Epp. i. 3. 31, or some other Plancus. But even if the father
be the man, Ι cannot see any such serious purpose in the ode as the above theory
implies, nor do I believe Augustus attached any such value to the renegade’s assistance.
He appears to have been a contemptible person. That the temple of ,Ianus was not
closed at the time is true (v. 20); but that does not fix the date before the battle of
Actium. Ι think the name of Plancus is again used more as a convenience than any thing
else, though there is perhaps a little more individuality given to this ode than the fourth.
The story of Teucer has all the appearance of a Greek origin.

Munatius Plancus, above referred to, was consul in A.u.c. 712. See C. iii. 14. 27,

“ Non ego hoc ferrem, calidus juventa,
Consule Planool’

ARGUMENT.

Let others sing of the noble cities of Greece, and dedicate their lives to the celebration
of Athens and all its glories. For my part 1 care not for Lacedaemon and Larissa,
as for Albunea’s cave, the banks of Anio, and the woods and orchards of Tibur. Τὶιθ
sky is not always dark, Plancus—drowa care in wine, whether in the camp or iu
the shades of Tibur. As Teucer, though driven from his father's home, bound
poplar on his head and cheered his companions, saying, ‘⁴ Let us follow fortune, my
friends, kinder than a father: despair not while Teucer is your chief 3 Apollo has pro-

mised us another Salamis : drown care in wine, for to-morrow we will seek the deep
once more.'’

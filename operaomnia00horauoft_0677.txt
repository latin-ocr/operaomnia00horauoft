Dum studet urbanus tenditque disertus haberi.
Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile; quodsi
Pallerem casu biberent exsangue cuminum.

Ο imitatores, servum pecus, ut mihi saepe

Bilem, saepe jocum vestri movere tumultus!

Libera. per vacuum posui vestigia princeps,

-N on aliena meo pressi pede.
Dux regit examen.

Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus

Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben.

Ac ne me foliis ideo brevioribus ornes

Quod timui mutare modos et carminis artem,
Temperat Archilochi Musam pede mascula Sappho,
Temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit quem versibus oblinat atris,

18. biberent extatque cuminum] The
fruit of this plant, which is a pleasant con-
diment, is desoeibed hy Pliny (xx. 15)oe
giving a pallid hue to the complexion.
Poesius ,also speaks of‘ ‘pallentis grana
mmini’ '.(S v. 56). ItisaplantofEastern
origin. We are familiar with it through
the proverbial nse ofthe name by our Lord
in his denunciation of the Pharisees, who
gave tithes of mint, anise, and cummin,

’ but neglected the weightier matters of the

law. It was used to express littleuess or
meanneoe in any shape. Horace says, if
he to look pale by any chance,
his imitators would,eat cummin seeds to

23. Parios ηομ-ἑπτα iambos] The iam-
bioe of Archilochus of Paros, who flourished
in the first half of the seventh century
nc. (See A. P. 79.) As to his attacks upon
Lycambos, see Epod. vi. 13, n. His daugh-

26. ne me foliis] “Ne minore corona ⁷
me decores* (Comm. Cruq..) Horace says
he is not to be blamed for imitating Archi-
lochus ιιι his measure and the structure of
his verse, for Alcaeus and Sappho did the
same3 they tempered their Muse with the
measure of Archilochus. The iambioe of
Archilochus are imitated by Horace in the
Epodes. Other measures of his he has
imitated in the Odae. It is not so easy to
see from the fragments that remain of the
three poets wherein Sappho and Alcaeus
imitated Archilochus, who flourished more
than halfa century before them. There is
little lefl: of Archilochus but his iambia.
A greater variety of meu-os is found in the
fragments of the other two3 but how far
the different measuroe were invented or
modified by them it is impossible to say.
Aloeens wroteverses inwhat is ealledthe
Sapphic metre, and Sappho in the Alcaic.
The style of Sappho’s frag-ments shows the
reason why Horace calls her ‘mascula'
There is avigour about the language and
illustrations which goesbeyond the ordinary
power of female passion, the delicacy of
which nevertheless is not lost in the bold-
ness of its expression. It is impossible not
to see the working of intense feeling in
some even of the shortest fragments. (See
C. ii. 13. 24, n.

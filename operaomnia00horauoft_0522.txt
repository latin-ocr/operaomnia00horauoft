Oaule suburbano qui siccis crevit in agris

HORATII FLAGOI

Dulcior ; irriguo nihil est elutius horto.
Si vespertinus subito te oppresserit hospes,
Ne gaHina malum responset dura palato,
Doctus eris vivam mixto mersare Falerno;

Hoc teneram faciet.

Browne disposes briefly of these notions:
44 That the sex is discernible from the figure
of eggs, or that cocks or heus prooeed from
long or round ones, as many contend, ex-
periment will easily frustrate '' (V ulg. Er.
iii. 28). ‘Callosa' signifies ‘ tough,' and
belongs in sense, though not in construc-
tion, to the yolk.

15. Caule suburbano] The reading of
nearly all the old editions and the best
MSS. is 4 cole! Acron too had that read-
ing, and says: “Cole: hoc est caule, ut
clode pro claude, Sorices pro Saurices3 coda
pro cauda.'’ The same variation appears
in Clodius and Claudius, Plotius and Plau-
tius, &c. Artificial streams and fish-ponds
were commonly introduced into the gardens
of rich people. Hence Catius says the
vegetables grown in the suburbs were not
so pleasant as those grown in the country
on drier soil. ‘Elutius ' Forcellini inter-
prets ‘infirmius ad alendum! Perhaps
Horace only means that they were insipid
from the quantity of water they imbibed.
“ Suburbano: quia suburbana loca rivis
abundant¹' (Acron); for the above reason
1 suppose.

17. vespertinus subito te oppresserit]
On ‘vespertinus’ see Epod. xvi. 513 and
for examples of 4 opprimere,' to overtake or
come upon one suddenly, see Forcell.

18. malum responset] ‘Responsare' is
used by Horace several times in the sense
of resistance. See below, S. 7. 85: 44 Re-
sponsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores;”
and v. 1⁰4 ε “ animus coenis responsat opi-
mis ;” and Epp. i. l. 68: “fortunae te
responsare superbae Liberum et erectum
praesens hortaturff’ Here it may be taken
in a similar way, or in the ordinary sense of

‘respondere, ’ according as we understand
‘.malum’ It may only mean ‘ill suitsss or
‘’malum may strengthen‘ responsat' as
‘male rauci' (S. i. 4. 66), ‘'responset

signifying to disagree with. Jacobs proposes
to read ‘ malum' as an expletive (malum !)‚
leaving ‘responsare’ to speak for itself in
the latter sense. “ Responset: resistat3
reluctetur in faucibus '' (Acron).

19. vivam mixto mersareFaternm] The

MSS. all have ‘mixto' or ‘mista’ and

Pratensibus optima fungis

nearly all editions till Bentley's. Landinus
is said by those who have seen his original
edition (I suppose) printed at Florenee in
1482, to have edited 4 mulso! The Vene-
tian edition of the following year, which is
said to be a reprint of the Florentiae, has
‘mixtos but ‘mulso' is the reading as-
sumed in Landinus' commentary printed in
that edition. Bentley edits 4 musto' for
‘misto ς’ and though this is a plausible
conjecture enough, there is no reason in my
opinion for altering the reading of the MSS.
‘ Mixto,' without any other word, would
naturally mean mixed with water, in spite
of what Bentley writes on the subject.
Catius’ rules, as we have already seen, if (aa
he says) they are new, are not very accu- .
rate, and it is fruitless to conjecture whether
he advised ‘mustum ’ or wine and water
for the steeping of fowls. If the question
is to be treated seriously, it may be doubted
whether the steeping in the diluted liquor
might nothe more advisable than in strong.

20. Pratemibus optima finffie] He
says the ‘fungi’ that grew in the open
meadows were more to be n-usoed than
others—that is, those which grew in the
shade. Truffles and different kinds of mush-
rooms were much eaten by the Romans as
they are still by the Italiam. Of the latter
there were and are great varieties. For-syth
(Italy, p. 81) mentium an astonishing
variety of mushrooms, all natives of Vallem}
brosa, a collection of which (painted) he
saw in the monastery of that place, with
this absurd motto, of which the author
asks, rather unnecessarily‚ whether it ia
correct in its etymology.—

“Naturae fetus mirare, sed aufuge fungos,
Namque 8 fungendo funere nomen

habet.''

'rba mushroom most highly esteemed was
the boletus, which was cultivated in gar-
dens and kept for the eating of the rich.
See Juvenal (v, 146): “Vilibus ancipites
fungi ponentur amicis, Boletus domin0;”
and Martial (iii. 60. 5): ‘⁴ Sunt tibi boleti,
fungos ego sumo suillos ;’' andi. 21. 2: 44 So·
lus boletos, Caeciliane, voras.’' The Libyan
mushroom was counted the best of the wild

460 HORATII FLAGGI

liasts tell us he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school. Damasippus calls him
(v. 286) ‘⁴ sapientum octavus.” His books, if he ever wrote them, have not reseued him
from oblivion. Horace mentions him again in Epp. i. 12. 20 as the representative of
the sect. Estre suggests that he may have been the Stertinius mentioned by Quintilian
(iii. 1. 21) as the author os a treatise on omtory, though, as he says, the Stoics troubled
themselves less with rhetoric than with dialectic.

The discourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every man in the world, high
or low, is mad except the sage (see note on v. 46). Cicero has argued the same doctrine
of the Stoics in his Paradoxa (iii. ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται), but he does not go very
deep into the subject, or throw much light upon it.

ARGUMENT.

You write so seldom‚ and destroy what you have written, and are angry with yourself
because you are too lazy to write any thing worth speaking of. What do you mean
to do ἓ You acknowledge you came to this retreat to escape the noise of the Satur-
nalia. Well, then, begin : let us have something suited to your intentions. It's of no
use to find fault with your pens and beat the wall. Where are all your promises?
What have you brought out all your books for? Do you mean to avoid odium by
shirking your duty? Men will only despise you for your pains. ”ris nothing bnt
sloth. Flee from the Siren, or be content to forfeit all you have earned in better
days.

(v. 16.) Heaven reward you, Damasippus, with a barber for your good advice. But how
came you to know me so well?

Since the usurers robbed me of all my money, I have taken to managing other people’s

affairs. 1 used to be such a successful driver of bai-gains in all sorts of property, that '

people called me every where the ward of Mercury.

1 am aware of that. How did you get rid of that mania? You seem, however, only to
have exchanged it for another, as a pain in the head is transferred to the stomach, or
aa the patient in a stupor suddenly falls to fighting his doctor. Only don’t follow his
example, and you may have it all your own way.

(v. 31.) My good friend, you need not deceive yourself. You, and all fools 1 may say,
are mad, if there be any truth in Stertinius, who saw me one day as 1 was ready to
throw myself into the river; and ‘¹ for shame,'' said he: “ why should you mind
being called mad when all are so? For what is madness? Folly and blindignorauea
of the truth. All are mad from the highest to the lowest, except the wise. As in a
wide wood where all lose their way, though all go in different directions, so is it with
fools. One is afraid where there is no fear3 another wantonly rushes into dangu,
and is deas to the voice of warning. You, Damasippus, have a madness for buying old
statues. But is the man who trusts you less mad? 1f 1 were to beg yon to accept a
present from me, would you be mad if you accepted it, or not rather mad if you refused
your good luck ? ‘ This rascal, get what security you will from him, tie him fast in a
thousand knots, like Proteus he will still get out of them ς’ but, friend Peffllius, if he
is mad for mismanaging his affairs, you are much more so for lending him money.

(v. 77.) “ Come listen to me, ye ambitious, ye avaricious, ye luxurious, ye superstitious,
and Ι will prove you all to be mad.

(v. 82.) “ The avaricious are the worst, almost past cure. Staberius would have the
amount of his fortune engraved upon his tomb. Why? Because he believed poverty
to be the greatest possible disgraoe3 and if he had been dying an as poorer, he would
have considered himself a worse man in that proportion: he thought that virtue, fame,
every thing gave way to wealth, and that its possessor was noble, brave, and just.
What, wise too? Aye, and a king to boot or any thing else. ⁴ But which is most mad

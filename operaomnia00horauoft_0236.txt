Away with sighs. Bear thy noble destiny, for one half the world shall take its ‘name

if it is akin to χαροπὸς, as Forcellini and
others say, belongs properly to the eolour
or appearance of the eyes. Horace applies
it to a wolf or a lion (Epod. xvi. 33), in the
latter case imitating perhaps Homer's χαρο·
ποῖ λέοντες (odyss, xi. 611). But what
does Homer mean? Etymology does not
help us, for χαροπὸς, except in a derived
sense, can only mean glad-eyed, and there
is nothing in the colour of a wolf or a lion
corresponding to that notion. The wolf is

not ⁴ rumpit,' as Bentley reads after
Graevius' MS„ is Ι believe the reading
which the sense requires. Bentley appears
to have mistaken the meaning of the pas-
sage. Τ118 image of the snake shooting
across the road recalls Jacob's prophecy in
respect to his son Dan: ‘⁴ Dan shall be a
serpent by the way; an adder in the path
that biteth the horse’s heels, so that his rider
shall fall backwards '¹ (Gen. xlix. 17).

butro speak of itasaddressed to ‘toneof

once. There is nothing of passion in this
or any other part of the ode, such as we find
in the elegies of Ovid and Propertius,
noticed in the introduction. ‘ Vetat' is the
reading of Lambinus and Bentley after 0118 of
the Vatican MSS. But ‘ vetet ' is requiredby
the sense and the reading of nearly every
MS. besides. The woodpecker was 8 bird
of ill omen. But why should ⁴ laevus' con-

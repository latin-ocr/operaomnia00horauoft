'drawing the wine from the ‘ diota’ (which
is the same as the ‘amphora’ ¹ testa,’ or
⁴ cadus ¹) into the crater or bowl in which
it was mixed with water. Here it means the
latter. The name of the wine is applied to
thevaesiel containing it here, as in ‘Graeca

a swect wine, and probably aster four years'
koepingwas in its prime. Horace calls it
elsewhere (C. i. 20. 1) ‘⁴ vile Sabinum,''
but that was as compared with Maecenas'
more expensive sorts. Of the other Italian
wine· that Horace mentions thebestwas from
the Caecubus ager in the south of Latium, at
the head of the bay of Amyclae ι the second
in rank was the Falernian, of which there
were several varieties, in connexion with
which he mentions an inferior sort from

(S. ii. 8. 16). sse wine of the Massic range
was apparently of delicate flavour (S. ii. 4.
54). Among the costly winoe of the rich
he mentions the Calenian from Cales, now
calvi, in Campania, and that of the Formian
bilis (C. i. 20. 9, ll). The worst wine he
’ speaks os (S. ii. 3. 143) was from the neigh-
bourhood of Veii, a red wine (Mart. i. 104.
9, “Veientani bibit-ur faex crassa 5ubelli'’).
There were other wines of different qualities
grown in Italy, which Horace does not hap-
pen to mention, the best of which, and placed
by Augustus above Caecuban, was the Seti-
nian from Setia in the Volscian territory,
now Sena (Westphal says a good wine
is still grown there). The Romans had
also imported winoe from the Aegean and

Asia Minor, of which Horace mentions
those from the islands of Cos, Lesbos, and
Chios. Of these the first was 'a white wine,
the second seems to have been the least

powerful, the third was most highly valued.
He speaks of Mareofic wine from the
neighbourhood os Alexandria (C. ἰ. 37. 10),
the vine producing which Virgil mentions
(Georg. ii. 91). But it does not appear
that that was drunk at Rome. Further
details will be found in Smith's Dict. Ant.

not agree altogether with Pliny's. But
there is ιιο article of commerce that under-
goes more variations in the course of a few
years than wine.

distinguishes ⁴ Fors’ from ‘ Fortuna’ thus:

(S. i. 1. 1). Nevertheless the Scholiasta Acron

said of things gained without our own
effort, according to Forcellini' sexplanation.

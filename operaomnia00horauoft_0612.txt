HORATII FLAGOI

Qui fodicet latus et cogat trans pondera dextram

Porrigere.

the guests the names and qualities of
the dishes, and parasites sometimes took
this office upon themselves, as we have
seen in S. ii. 8. Pliny mentions that in
his time the number of slaves in a house·
hold was such that it was necessary to
keep a ‘nomenclator ’ to tell the master
their names and offices (xxxiii. 1): ‘⁶ Hoc
perfecere mancipiorum legiones, et in domo
turba externa, ac servorum quoque eausa
nomenclator adhibendus.'’ For these rea-
sons women also had servants of this class,
as we read in Suetonius, who speaks of a
‘ nomenclator ¹ belonging to the wife of
Telephus having formed a design on Au-
gustus (vit. Aug. c. 19). Women had their
throngs of courtiers as the men had.

50. laevum Qui fodicet latus] As to
‘laevum latus? see S. ii. 5. 17, 11. Α great
many MSS., including all the Parisian and
all the old editions, have ‘saevum,’ which
appears to me to have no meaning, though
some persons defend it in the sense of
‘ durum,' and support it by the word ‘cogat,'
as if the candidate were reluctant. But the
reverse is implied. The man who should

about shaking hands with any one. ⁴ Cogat'
merely expresses the energy of the ‘ nomen-
clator.’ All the old editions, all Lambinus'
MSS., and many others, have ‘ fodiat!
Torrentius has that reading, but quotes
⁴ fodicet ' from three MSS., in one of which
there was this note ι “ fodicare est leviter ac
superficie tenus fodere,’' which is con
to its meaning iu Cicero (Tusc. iii. 16), 81111
Plautus, Bacch. i. l. 30 (quoted by Forcel-
lini), and Cas. ii. 6. 9, “ stimulus ego nunc
sum tibi ε Fodico corculum.'’ in all of which
places it expresses 8 deep impression on the
mind. Here it means a hearty thrust cor·
responding to ‘ cogat!

51. trans pondera dextram Porriyere.]
The meaning of ‘ trans pondera' has been
doubted. Orelli understands ‘ pondera' to
mean the weights standing in front of a shop,
so that the man when he came to the shop of
any one who could command votes was to

” stretch his hand over them to greet the

shopkeeper. 1 do not think this is right.

understand the man to 110111 out his hand to
help the other over 811 obstruction. It is
rather to shake hands with him. Obstruc-
tions were common 111 the narrow streets of
Rome, such 88 Horace describes Epp. ii. 2.

date for the aedileship, shaking hands with

humouredly “ if he walked on his hands,”
they were so hard.

52. Hic multum in Fabia παρή] Servius
Tullius, as is well known, divided the Plebes
into thirty tribes, of which four were of the
city and twenty-six were of the couno-y..
Of these twenty-six ten appear to have been
swallowed up by the conquesta of Porsenna,
and of the remaining sixteen the Fabia was
one. The number was gradually incre-sed
from sixteen to thirty-oum buit it was not
till A.u.c. 51 l, towards the end of the first
Punic War, that the Quirina. and Velina
were added, being eomposed⁴ of ns
belonging to Cures and Velinus iu the
Sabine territory (Liv. Epit. xxx.). These
were the last tribes that were formed.

53. hic fasces dabit] On the ‘fasoes,'
see Dict. Ant. The ‘ sella curulis,’ or 011811·
of state, was ornamented with ivery, sud‘
expressions like Horace's are common.- It
was called by the Greek writers ἐλεφάν-
τινος, δίφρος. Ovid (ex Pont. iv. 9. 27)
says,—

“ Signa quoque in sella nossem formata
curuli,

Et totum Numidae sculptile dentis

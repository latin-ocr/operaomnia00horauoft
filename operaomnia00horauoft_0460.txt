HORATII FLAGOI

certain from that passage that he still
retained these duties. The Scholiasts give
other conjectures respecting this allusion to
Tarpa, but the above seems to be the true
explanation. The meaning of ⁴ aede'
cannot be so readily determined. Comm.
Cruq. says it was “Aedes Apollinis seu
Musarum‚” and Bentley on Epp. ii. 2. 92,
says it was either the library attached to the
Palatine temple of Apollo, or the temple
called ⁴ Herculis Musarum‚' rebuilt by
Philip, the step-father of Augustus, and
called from him ‘ Porticus Philippi. But the
former temple was not built till the autumn
of ΛΑΜ). 726. (C. i. 31. Int). The latter
(though this has been denied, see Estre,
Prosop. p. 209) was probably the same
temple, restored and beautified, as that
erected to the Muses by Fulvius Nobilior,
about A.u.c. 575. Temples of Apollo and
the Muses are referred to by Juvenal (S. vii.
37) as the resort of poets, and there can be
no doubt that other temples besides (see
Ovid. Trist. iii. l. 69) had buildings at-
tached where men of letters assembled. In
one of these, therefore, or some building
especially consecrated to the Muses (for
‘ aedes' in the singular number cannot sig-
nify a private house, nor does the context
admit of that interpretation, which Masson,
Franke, and others give it) poets who had
plays they wished to get represented recited
them, probably in the presence of Tarpa.
Comm. Cruq. says that this duty was com-
mitted to Tarpa in conjunction with five
others. It had previously formed part of the
functions of the aediles, and it was not till
political allusions became common, and
the position of affairs too critical to bear
them, that this special censorship was
created.

42. Unus vivorum, Fundani :] Of this
Fundanius, who Horace says was the only
man of the day who could write a comedy
in the style of Menander and that school,
nothing whatever is known, and conjectures
are useless. Because he is mentioned with
Pollio, who gave up arms for, letters,
Weichert (Poet. Lat. p. 51, n. 41) conjec-
tures he may have been C. Fundanius, an
eques who, we are informed by the author
of the Bellum Hispanicum (c. ll) deserted
Sext. Pompeius and went over to Augustus
(see Dict. Biog.). But this is not a very

good argument. He is mentioned with
Pollio because the one wrote comedies and
the other tragedias. Fundanius is the
narrator of the scene in S. ii. 8, the supper
of Nasidienus. 1 think it probable Horace
exaggerated his merits as well as Pollio's
out of affection for the men. As to Pollio,
see C. ii. l. Int., and v. lo, ιι. “Pollio's
political greatness might easily dazzle the
eyes of his contemporaries as to the true
value of his political works,’' is Schlegel's
opinion (Drama, Lect- via), and he thinks
that though “we cannot exactly estimato
the extent of our loss (in the tragedias of the
Augustan age) to all appearance it is not
extraordinarily great.” ‘Regum‚¹ such aa

significations of‘ ducere’ are so various, as
observed before (C. iv. 6. 2), that it is hard
to follow them. As applied to a poem it is
supposed by some to be taken from the pro-
cess of spinning, which receives support
from Epp. ii. l. 225: “tenui deducta
poemata filo.” See S. ii. l. 4: ‘⁶ Mille die
versus deduci posse.'’ Others suppose itto

Whether Virgil had at this fimo pu lishad

” his Georgics or not is quite uncertain, from

the doubt that hangs over both the date of
this Satire and the publication of those
poems. But at any rate Vir-gil had them' m

Scholiasts say that Virgil ap ppws to have
written the Georgi ω and Bucolic's3 but

they only gather this probably from *the
text. The Bucolics had been published
some time, and they seem to have bean well
thought of, though until the Aeneid had
made some progress we have no reason to
suppose that Virgil was classed by his con-
temporaries with poets of the first rank.
Certainly his Eclogues do not daeerve a
higher place than is due to polished versifica-
tion, and will bear no comparison with the
Idylls of Theocritus—⁴ Facetum' significa

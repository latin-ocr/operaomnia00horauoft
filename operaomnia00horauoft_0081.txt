CARMEN XXI.

'rho year aster Angustus returned to Rome from the taking of Alexandria, that' is
Am. c. 726, he dedicated a temple to Apollo on the Palatine hill (C. i. 31), and instituted
' qmqneunial games in honour of Apollo and Diana, and called them the‘ Ludi Actiaci!
For their first celebration Franks supposes Horace to have written this ode, and Cru-
quius’ §choum bears him out by a remark which, though by some confusion it has got
transfer-redte the saecular ode, belongs plainly to this. The scholiasts and some commen-
morollowing them believed this ode to be an introductiou to the mcular. Sanadon, on
whom our translator Friincis pinned his saith, held that opinion, aud placed them together,
md ao does the translator. Franke's opinion is rendered doubtful by the word ⁴ principe '
(v. 1⁴), for Augustus did not get that title till the idos of January, A.u.c. 727, aud there-
fore aster the first celebration of the Actian gemes. Others refer this ode to a later year,
731, when, as we learn from Dio Cass. (liv. l), Rome was visited by pestilenoe and
famine. It is more likely, as Orelli remarks, to have been an exorciso from fancy sug·
gested by some such festival as that of 726. It has not the dignity or pretensions of
‚an ode written for such a special occasion.

ARGUMENT.
Siug, ye damsels, of Diana3 sing, ye youths, of Apollo and Intona dear toJ ove, of Diana
who rejoioes in the streams and woods of Algidus, or Erymanthus, or Cragus. Praise
,ο no lua Tempe aud Delos Apollo's birth-place, and the shoulder that is grnoed with

the quiver and the lyre—-that in answer to your prayer he may turn the griefs of war,
, familie, and plague from Rome and her Prinoe upon the heads of her enemies.

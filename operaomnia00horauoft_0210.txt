180 - HORATII FLACGI

CARMEN XVI.

Horace here dwells on his favour-ite theme,—contentment and medentium—which he‘
is able to illustrate by the example of Maecenas as well as his own. The ingenuity which
has discovered the occasion that gave rise to this ode will hardly throw any new light on
the meaning of it, which is very plain. Whether therefore Horace's friends had urged
him to make more than he had done of his opportunities with Maecenas for the purpose
of enriching himself or not may very well remain doubtful. Ι confess the idea would not
have occurred to me. The anch editors suppose it to be an ode of thanks to Maecenas
for the gift of the farm, which it certainly is not ; and one editor, J. F. Schmid, suspects
Horace meant gently to hint to his patron that he should be glad of an extension of his
liberality, a species of εἰρωνεία which it is to be hoped does not represent the principles
of the person who suggests this notion. There is no clue to the date of the ode further
than that it was written after Horace came into possession of his farm.

ARGUMENT.

A siout prison and savage watch-dogs might have kept Danae from haring but Jove and
Venus smiled‚ for they knew that the god need but change himself to gold, and the
way would be clear before him. Gold penetrates through guards3 gold shall burst
rocks; thereby fell the house of Amphiaraus3 thereby the Macedonian won ἀίξας
thereby stern admirals are ensnared. And as it grows the desire for more grows too.
A high estate Ι dread. Maecenas, thou good knight, the more a man denies himself
the more the gods will give him. Ι fly from the rich to the contented, and am more
independent than any poor rich man in the world. My stream, and my little wood,
and my trusty field, are a happier portion than all Africa. I have no honey of Cala-
bria, nor wine of Formiae, nor Gaulish fleece, yet poverty doth not pinch me; aud is 1
wanted more thou art ready to give it. My small income will go further by the re-
sti-icting of my wants, than if I had all Lydia and Phrygia for my own. who ask
much lack much. It is well with him who has enough.

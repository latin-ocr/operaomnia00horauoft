EPISTOLARUM Ι. 8.

Ouso gaudere et bene rem gerere Albinovano

Musa rogata refer, comiti scribaeque N eronis.

Si quaeret quid agam, dic multa et pulchra minantem

Vivere nec reete nec suaviter3 haud quia grando

contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus, 5
Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris;

Sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto

Nil audire velim, nil discere, quod levet aegrum;

Fidis offendar medicis, irascar amicis, ·

Gur me funesto properent arcere veterno ;

10

Quae nocuere sequar, fugiam quae profore credam ς
Romae Tibur amem ventosus, Tibure Romam.
Post haec ut valeat, quo pacto rem gerat et se,

Ut placeat juveni percontare utque cohorti.

Si dicet, Recte, primum gaudere, subinde

Praeceptum auriculis hoc instillare memento:
Ut tu fortunam sic nos te, Celse‚ feremus.

(C. i.33. 3), ‘cohorti’ (S. i.7. 23).

Po, have been referred to before (C. iii. 16.
35; Epod. i. 27). The levying of a tax on
flocks fed on the southern pastures, referred
tointhelntterofthosenotes, hasbeen
continued to modern times. At the town
of Boggia in Puglia (Apulia), Swinburne
mysthereis“aregiste·r0fficeknownby
the name of‘ Tribunale della dognna della
mena della pecore di Puglia' (the custom-
house for the tollof the sheep thatpassto
and from Pugna). It is managed by a
governor, auditor, and two advocates, and
has the distribution of a fixed assment
upon all sheep that descend in autumn from

the mountains of Abruzzo into the warm
plains of Puglia, where they yean, and in
May return to the high country. '’ “This
dogana' is one of the richest mines of wealth
belonging to the crown of Nep les, and is
capable ofgreat increase. At present (1777)
the net profit arising to the king from the
letting of the poetures is about 40,000
duoetsff’ The reading ‘arvis' which ap-
pears in some editiongs and MSS. is inad-
missible. That word is used for arable
land. ‘Ager’ appliae to that and pasture
and other lands too.

mind, and his faithful physicians are the
friends who would cheen- and ronse him,
though we may take the word ‘medicis '
literally and suppose he was under medical
treatment. His feelings probably arose out
of the state of his health.

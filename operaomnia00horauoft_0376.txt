346 HORATII FLAGGI

SATIRE III.

Horace appears to have brought enemies npon himself by the last Satire, and perhaps
by others, which have not been published. His amiable temper was not very well qnali-
fied for that sort of writing, and we may infer from the present poem that he wished to
clear himself from the imputation of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right with
Maecenas and his friends. The connexion between the two Satires is seen in the opening
of this, in which Tigellius is again introduced and the peculiarities of his character de-
scribed, for no other reason, as it would seem, bnt to serve as a text for the discourse

that follows, on the duty of judging others charitably as we wish to be judged our-
selves. In the course of his remarks on this subject Horace comes aoeom two of the

Stoic absurdities: one that all faults are alike (v. 96, sqq.), which he meets by the
Epicurean absurdity that expediency is the foundation of right; and the other that every

wise man (that is, every Stoic) is endowed with all the gists of art and fortune from the Ι

skill of the mechanic to the power of a king. With a jest upon this folly the Satira
closes.

The character of Tigellius is happily described (“ Not one, butall mankind's epitome”),
and a tone of good feeling runs throughout the Satire. The language is gunial, and
the sentiments amiable. ΤΙιε style is Horace's own, as we may suppose. 'l'hat of
Lucilius, it is clear, was more after the fashion of the second Satire, in which his
freedom of speech and licentious language appear to me to be aimed at without the
power which he possessed of giving them point and severity. No one who reads this
Satire would wish to see Horace in the disguise of the other. ν

If there is between the two the connexion above supposed, the third Satin-e must have
been written at no great distance of time after the other. But it appears from v. 63
that he was now well acquainted with Maecenas, though not on the terms of intimacy
which afterwards grew up between them. On these grounds it seems probable that the
Satire was written about the end of A.u.c. 716, as Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMENT.

Singers have all one fault—that they will never sing to their friends when they are asked,
and never leave off when they are not. This was the case with rligellius, the most
inconsistent manin the world. Caesar himself could not induce him tn sing unless
he chose; when the fit was on him he would keep it up from the first course to the
dessert3 one moment in a hurry, another absurdly slow; now with 200 slaves, now

with but ten; one while talking big, another all humility; one while content with a ·

little, another squandering millions; up all night, snoring all day.

But what, have you no faults? Yes, but perhaps not so bad as his. And yet Ι am
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbour’s faults, coolly declared he
made excuses for his own. Why should a man be blind to his own defecta and have
an eagle’s eye for his fellows'? He may presently find them turning the tables upon
him. Your friend we will say is a little hasty, and sensitive, and perhaps not very
polished3 but he is a good man, and kind to you, and a man of genius withal. In
short, examine yourself, and see what faults nature or neglect has sown in your own
breast before you pass judgment on others.

Let us think of this, how the lover overlooks or even loves the deformities of his miza-as.
So let us err in friendship and not be too fastidiens3 even as the fond father finds

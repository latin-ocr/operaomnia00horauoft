HORATII FLAOOI

Beluis nec te, metuende certa

Hunc equis, illum superare pugnis

Defluit saxis agitatus humor,

Concidunt venti fugiuntque nubes,

Et minax, quod sic voluere, ponto

Unda recumbit.

21. Proeliis· audax] It will be readily
seen that Horace confounds the Latin divi-
nity Liber with the Greek Dionysus or
Bacchus, whose Indian wars and contest
with the giants (ii. 19. 21) are here alluded
to. Bentley puts a stop after these words
and applies them to Pallas.

waters that in their fury covered the rocks
flow back to their bed. Torrentius com-
paring Epp. i. 2. 42, ‘⁴ Rusticus expectat
dum defluatamnis‚'’ renders ‘defluit,' ⁴ cemes
to flow down the rocks! Theocritus’ de-
scription of a calm produced by the influ-
ence of the Twins should be compared with
this (xxii. 19).

34. superbos Tarquini fasces] It has been
much disputed whether this refers to Tar-
quinius Priscus or Superbus. But for the
epithet applied to ⁸ fasces' there could
be no doubt. The Scholiasts suppose Pris-
cus to be the person alluded to, and more
editors hold that opinion than the other.
Those who contend for Superbus quote
Cicero, Phil. iii. 4, where comparing this
king withM- Antonius he makes him out to
‘be better than history draws him. But Cicero
spoke for a purpose, and his statements are
chiefly negative. On another occasion he
wrote differently, saying, “ Quis est qui—

Tarquinium Superbum — non οδω-ἥγ’

(De Am. 8). It may be admitted however
that the propriety of all the names in this ’
catalogue of worthies is not obvious. Why
for instance among so small a number the
Scauri should appear, of whom the best,
M. Aemilius, who was consul A.u.c. 638,
and who had good qualitiea mixed up with
many that were bad (see his Life in snith’s
Dict. Biog.), was not worthy of so gie-t a
distinction, nobody has attempted to ex-
plain. It is certainly only necessary to
suppose Μ. Aemilius Scaurus alludad ιο
here as in Juvenal, xi. 90, where heia intro-
duced in similar company, and in the plu-1
number, on which point see S. i. 7. 8, ιι. =

Et (31:03ng et Fabricios, postmno severos
Censoris mores etiam collega timeret. '³

The place in which Cato’s name is mm-
tioned is also an offence to some, and
Bentley wishes to sweep him out altogether,
and substitute Curtius, reading ‘ anne Curti’
for ‘ an Catonis!
converts, and does not adopt his own con-
jecture, it is not necessary to meddle with
his argument. We must be content to take
the names Horace has given ua, and as to
Tar-quin the reader must judge for himself.

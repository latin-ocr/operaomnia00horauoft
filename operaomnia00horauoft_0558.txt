“ Non dices hodie, quorsum haec tam putida tendant,

Fortunam et mores antiquae plebis, et idem

Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat usque recuses,

Aut quia non sentis quod clamas rectius esse,

Aut quia non firmus rectum defendis, et haeres
Nequicquam coeno cupiens evellere plantam.
Romae rus optas, absentem rusticus urbem

Tollis ad astra levis.

Ad coenam laudas securum olus ac, velut usquam

Vinctus eas, ita te felicem dicis amasque
Quod nusquam tibi sit potandum. J usserit ad se

is better off, 81111 1888 miserable than the
other. Some MSS. have 4 acrior illo!

21. Non dices hodie‚] ‘ Hodie ' is equiva-
lent to ‘ statim,’ ‘this moment! Doering
interprete ‘ this day of the Saturnalia,’
which destroys the force of the word alto-
gether. ‘ Furcifer ⁹ is explained by Donatus
on Terence (Andr. iii. 5. 12: “ Tibi ut ego
credam, furcifer ?’') as a slave who for some
slight offence was obliged to go about with
a‘furea’ round his neck,a sort of collar
shaped like a V, in which the hands also
were inserted. The master begins to see
that Davus is 8181183 a stroke at him, and
is getting angry.

23. antiquae plebia] 4 Plebs' has not
its distinctive meaning in this place. (See
C. iii. 14. l, 8.) Horace is 8ο doubt
touching his own infirmity here. He was
fond of praising the simplicity of the olden
time, but he was not the man to extricare
himself from the degenerata habits of his
own day (‘ nequicquam coeno cupiens evel-
lere plantam,' which is taken from the Greek
proverb ἐκτὸς πηλοῦ πόδα ἔχειν). Η8 had
been but lately perhaps writing the praises
of 8 country life and sighing for his farm
(in the last Satire); but when there we may
believe he felt dull enough, and missed the
society and elegancies of the city. What-
ever his ordinary fare may have been, he
had no objection to the tables of the rich,
8811 was proud to be invited to the Esq ui-
liae. It is this good-tempered 18111811 of

himself that makes some of Horaee's writ
ings so agreeable, and the man himself
appear 80 amiable. There is much humour
in this part of the satire. He 18 su
to be congratulating himself upon being
suffered to dine quietly at home when he
gets an unexpected invitation from Mae·
cenas to a late dinner. He immediately
shouts for 1118 lantern, seolds the servants if
they keep him waiting a moment, and runs
offas fast ashe oan,lesvingin the lui-ch
some persons to whom he had promised a
dinner, and who go away disappoinoed and
muttering abuse.

331»αὸ lumina prima] ‘Immediately
after the lighting of the 181888.(888
Epod. ii. 44, n.) The ordinary 1118881·-
hour was earlier (888 C. i. l. 20, n.), but
Maeoenas' occupationspro tracted his ‘ soli-
dus dies‚’ at the end of which he was glad
enough no doubt to geta achaei-ful oom-
panion like Horaoe to dine with him.

‘’Blatero is to bawl, or more commonly to
babble and talk 80888888. (888 romu.)

‘Mulvius' may be any body, one of the
numerous tribe of parasitos. ‘Non mse-
renda precati,’ uttering cumes which the
servants heard but must not repeat. See
last Satire, v. 30st ‘iratis p.recibus¹'
observes (p. 441). ‘Habuit parasitos quo-
que suos Horatius. Quid mirum. ³ Pasoebat
Diogenes mures. (Diog. Laert. lib. vi. c.
40). Colloeandos autem censemus infin
servos.”

SATIRARUM II. 6.

Aridum et ore ferens acinum semesaque lardi

Frusta dedit, cupiens varia fastidia coena

· Vincere tangentis male singula dente superbo ;
Gum pater ipse domus palea porrectus in horna
Esset ador loliumque, dapis meliora relinquens.

Tandem urbanus ad hunc.

Praerupti nemoris patientem vivere dorso. ²
Vis tu homines urbemque feris praeponere silvis. ⁹

Carpe viam, mihi crede, comes; terrestria quando
Mortales animas vivunt sortita, neque ulla est

„ Aut magno aut parvo ‘leti fuga:

Dum licet in rebus jucundis vive beatus3

Vive memor quam sis aevi brevis?

Agrestem pepulere domo levis exsilit; inde
Ambo propositum peragunt iter, urbis aventes

Moenia nocturni subrepere.

Nox medium caeli spatium cum ponit uterque
In locuplete domo vestigia, rubro ubi cocco
Tincta super lectos canderet vestis eburnos,
Multaque de magna superessent fercula coena,

Quae procul exstructis inerant hesterna canistris.

‘ Quid te juvat? inquit,‘ amice, 90

quo, bone, circa, 95
Haec ubi dicta

Ergo ubi purpurea porrectum in veste locavit

editors adop t ‘ille.’

The‘ avena ’here is εὔφραινε σαυτὸν, πῖνε, τὸν καθ’ ἡμέραν

tho cultivatled oat, and ‘longae’ describes βίον λογίζου σὸν, τὰ δ’ ἄλλα τῆς τύχης,

its grain. Τ110 wild oat virgil distinguishae
from thisby the epithet‘ sterilis’ (G. i. 153),
and couples it with the‘ lolium‚' or tare,
with which the host on this occasion satis-
fied himself.

87. male] This goes with ‘tangentisl
and is equivalent to ⁴ vix!

89. Esset ador loliumque,]
was that coarse kind of

Τ110 ‘ ador '
grain which was
called ζεία by the Greeks, but the name
was applied to grain in general, and in the
form‘ adorea’ signified the supply of corn
given to soldiers after a victory ‚and hence
was used as 571101171110115 with victory itself.
(See C. iv. 4. 41, 11.)

93. mihi crede,] Τ11050 words are pa.-i
renthetioel, 05 Ovid (Am. ii. 2. 9): “S
sapis ο custos odium, mihi crede, mereri
Desine.” The language that follows is very
like that of Hercules in Euripides’ play
of Alcestis (782, sqq.).

βροτοῖς ἅπασι κατθανεῖν ὀφείλεται,

κοῦκ ἐστι θνητῶν” eoric ἐξεπίσταται

τὴν αὔριον μέλλουσαν εἰ βιώσετ αι. -
ταῦτ’ οὖν ἀκούσας καὶ μαθὼν ἐμοῦ πείρα

98. pepulere] Τ1115 15 115011 absolutely
in the sense of‘ movere.¹

100. nocturna] Seec. i. 2. 45,11.

103. canderet vestie eburnam] On the
‘stragula vestis’ 500 S. 3. 118, 11. Τ110
sides of the coucheswere sometimae veneered
with ivory. Fire is said ‘candere,’ and
the flaming drapery of the bed is 11010
described by the 501110 770111, which is not
applied in this sense elsewhere. ‘ Fercula’
was the name for the different 00111505, of
which the ⁴ coena ' usually consisted of three,
called ‘prima,’ ‘secundass ‘tertia coena!
The word, like ‘ feretrum,' contains the root

‘fer ’ of ‘ fero‚' and so its first meaning 11107
11070 been the tray or dish on which the
71011115 were brought. It seems here to
mean the viands themselves; ‘many course·
were left' would mean nothing. ‘ Procul’
signifies ‘hard by,' as in Epp. i. 7. 32.
Τ110 remains of the evening ’s ‘coena’ had
been collected and put into baskets and left
in the ⁴ triclinium ’ till the morning, and the
purple coverings were still exposed waitingtill
the servants should cover them (S. 4. 84, 11.).

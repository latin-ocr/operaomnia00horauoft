Septimius Severus, close to which, under the
east side of the Mons Capitolinus, was the
Carum* Tullianus or Mamertinus, the great
prison built, as tradition said, by Servius
Tullius. At the above spot the oeptivoe were

Samnite general was, and usually strangied

of which any map of the city will enable
the student to follow the triumpbsl proces-

the Campus Maximus was tramea, the
distance passed over must have been not

the Templum Pacis and the Forum.

12. Unquam] Some of the old editions
have‘ nunquaiu.¹ So it is in that of 1483,
where for ‘dispar' we have‘ disparibus‚’
showing a careless copyist, and therefore
not to be trusted. That the same reading
should have been found by Bentley ιιι the
edition of 1490 is not wonderful, since it is
a mere reprint of the other, and that of the
florentine edition of the previous year,
which Fea says hm the sanie reading. It
was easilyperpetu ated as being at the first
glauce inore intelligible. Butg there is no
MS. authority for‘ nunquam, 'and the only
objection to ⁸ unquam ' is the somewhat re-
dundant character-of the word ¹ feris,' which
Orelli excuses on the score of the author-'s
youth, but Dillenbr. and others think a

says, to θεοῦ βία, θεοβλάβειας and it is κο
explained by Gaius with reference to such
a visitation of God as a storin, earthquake,

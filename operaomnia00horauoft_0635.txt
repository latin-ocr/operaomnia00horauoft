direct question, is rare, and perhaps li-
mitad in the best writers to ‘necne.'”

the true reading, ‘'fama must be followed
by a note of interrogation.

5. Attalicis ea· urbibus] One of the
towns of the kingdom of Pergamum be-
queathed by Attalus 111. to the Roman
people, and constituted a Roman province
on the defeat of Aristonicus, A.u.c. 625.
The forta-ess of Pergamum in Mysia was
antrusted by Lysimachus to his officer Phi-
letaoeus, who made himself independent,
and held the town and its vast treasures, of
which he had charge, for twenty years, be-
ginning nc. 283. His successor, Eumenes
I., defeated the army of Antiochus the
Great near Sardes, and added some of the
surrounding country to his ‘ons to
which his successor Attalus 1. added more
by the conquest of the Gallo-Graeci, and he
first took the title of king of Pergamum.
nis successura, adhering to the alliance of
tho Romans, got the benefit of their suc-
cesses against Antiochus ; and the kingdom
of Pergamum, when it was handed over ιο
the Emmaus, included Mysia, Lydia, Ionia,
and part of Caria, the principal cities of
which (μητροπόλεις) were Ephesus, Perga·
mum, Sardes, Smyrna, Lampsacus, Cyzicus.
Other large towns were Tralles, Adramyt-
tium, Thyatira, &c., nearly all of which are
shown by the ruins that remain to have
been built and ornamented on a magnificent
scale.

6. An Lebedum laudas] Lysimachus,
aster the battle of Ipsus (n.c. 301). when
he became master of the western part of
Asia Minor, destroyed the towns of Lebe-
dus and Colophon in Ionia, and transferred
their inhabitants to Ephesus. Lebedus never
seems to have been rebuilt so as to recover
any of its former importance, and the ruins
of the old town probably helped to cause
the desolate appearance described by Hc-
race. There are some ruins still in ex-
istence, marking the spot where this town
stood, now called Ecclesia, or Xingi
(Cramer). Horace writes as if he knew
Lebedus, but did not know the other places
he refers to before. He must have seen
ᾗ place, if at all, in his campaigning with

Gabii was an ancient town of Latium, an

Alban colony, 100 stadia from Rome, which
excavations, made about the end of the last
century, show ιο have stood on a place
now called l'Osteria del Pantano (Cramer).
In Cicero's time it was a municipium (Pro
Plane. c. 9). During the civil wara it fell
into ruins; so that Lucan says,

Gabios, Veiosque, Coramque
Pulvere gxi, ιὲῧιὲιῗ poterunt monstrare rui-

Propertius mentions its desertion and for-
mer greatness in one line,—
“ Et qui nunc nulli maxima turba GabiJ’

Juvenal mentions it as a place of rssort for

people in humble circumstances, as—

“ Quis timet aut timuit gelida Praeneste
Aut ι,ριῖοιέἰὶιῖἰιξἰιοιιιονιοειι inter juga Volsiniis,
simssiigibus Gabiis?’' (iii. 190).

jam celebres notique poetae

Balneolum Gabiis, Romae conducere furnos
Tentarent ” (vii. 3).

In Horace’s time, while cold bathing was
the fashion under the advice of Antonius
Musa, it appears Gabii was resorted to.
Horace may have been there himself. See
Epp. 15. 9. The town was restored under
the Emperors Antoninus and Commodus,
and recovered some importance. There
was a temple of Juno at Gabii, of which
some remains are said to exist still. Several
statues and inscriptions were found when
the excavations took place.

Fidenae was about five miles from Rome,
in the Sabine territory, of which remains are
still in existence near Castel Giubileo
(Cramer). In A.u.c. 329 the town was
destroyed by Aemilius Mamercus (Liv. iv.
9). Previous to this it had been one of
the most tmubloeome of the Roman pos-
sessions, making many efforts to recover
its independence. According to tradition
Romulus found it a large town and con-
quered it (Dionys. Halic. ii. 23), but it
seems never to have risen to any great im-
portance again. It appears from Tacitus
(Anu. iv. 62) that Fidenae was a muni-
cipium in the time of Tiberius. He relatos,
in his own style, a dreadful accident by the
falling of a temporary amphitheatre‚ by
which he says 50,o00 persons were killed

HORATII FLA 001

Vulgavi fidicen ; juvat immemorata ferentem
ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector

Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus?
Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor ‚
Impensis coenarum et tritae munere vestis;

Non ego nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor

Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor:
‘⁶ Spissis indigna theatris

Hinc illae lacrimae.

“ Non ante vulgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis ;”

and 3. 23: “Romanae fidicen lyrae.'’
‘C Irlgpcgoossglli refers to Alcaeus, comparing

I do not
feel certain about it. Forcellini only meu-
tions one other example of ⁴ immemoratus '
from Ausonius. ⁴ Ingenuis' Orelli thinks
is opposed to ‘libertinis,’ of which class
Horace’s chief detractors, the grammarians,
were. (See below, v. 40, n.) But Horace
may have had many friends who, like his
father, were not ‘ingenui' in this sense.
(See S. i. 6. 6, n.) Ι think he means
candid or uncorrupted.

35. inqratus] I suppose he means that
the reader is ungrateful who gets gratifica-
tion from his poems at home, and yet
abuses them abroad 3 so that ‘ ingratus ¹ in
fact belongs to the second clause as well as
‘iniquus’ The reason Horace gives is,
that 110 does not go about seeking the good
opinion of vulgar critics, giving them dinners
and cast-off clothes, and so 011, but keeps
himself to the company of respectable
authors, listening to their writings and
getting them to listen to his own. The
language is taken from the notion of ean-
vassing for votes at an election-

38. Impensie coenarum]
imitated this (S. i. 54):

Calidum scis ponere sumen ε
Scis comitem horridulum trita donare la-
cerna.

It may refer to Archilochus.

Persius has

 

39. auditor et ultor] These words 810
reciprocal. The man who listens to a prosy
recitation has his revenge when he recites
in return. Here it is meant in a good-
humoured way. Juvenal's first Satire be-
gins “ Semper ego auditor tantum? nun-
quamne reponam ?'’ As to the practice of

40

recitation among friends and in public, see
C. ii. l, Int., and S. i. 4. 73, n.

40. Grammaticus ambire tribue] Those
who made a profession of literature were
called ‘ literati,' ‘eruditi,' or ‘ grammatici!
The last name was applied principally to
those who kept schools or gave lecturos, of
whom there were a great many at this time
at Rome. Inferior writers would give 8
good deal for their favourable opinion,
which would help their books into demand
among their scholars. Suetonius has given
a short notice of the prineipal teachers, of
whom he says the first was Crates of Mallos

(a city of Cilicia), who was seut on 811 0111- >

bassy to the senate by Attalus, king of
Pergamum, between the second and third
Punic warS. He broke his leg, and during
the confinement this accident caused 110
gave lectures, ἀκροάσεις, which example
was followed by others. At first, Suetonius
says, they took the wo'rks of deceased
writers and commented upon these.. Aster-
wards they came to writing themselves aud
descanting upon their own works, then
upon those of their contemporaries. The
name applied probably to all who kept
schools, even for children, in which grammar
(that is, literature either Greek or Roman,
ancient or modern) was taught, 83 opposed
to the teachers of rhetoric, music, &c. But
there were others whose lecturos were atae
tended by youths who had left school and by
grown up persons. Some of them, Sueto'-
nius says, made a great deal of money.
Those that 110 mentions were with few
exoeptions freedmen. (See above, v. 32, n.)
Horace calls them ‘critici ' elsewhere (A. P.
78). ⁴ Pulpitum ' meant any raised plat-
form from which speeches were delivered.
Here it applies to that from which the
teachers delivered their lectures.

41. Hinc illae lacrimae] This became
8 conventional way of speaking after Te-
rence (Andr. i. l. 99)= ‘⁴ Atat hoc illud est:
Hinc illae lacrimae, haec illa est miseri-
cordia.’' Cicero, who was very partial to

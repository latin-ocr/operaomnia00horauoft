HORATII FLAGGI

ARGUMENT.

Tin now I have fought and won. Now 1 hang up my arms to Venus. Here, here hang
my torches, my bars, and my bow. Ο 111011 queen of Cyprus and of Memphis, do but

once lay thy rod upon the proud Chloe.

lel puellis nuper idoneus
Et militavi non sine gloria ;
Nunc arma defunctumque bello
Barbiton hic paries habebit,
Laevum marinae qui Veneris latus 5

Custodit.

Hic hic ponite lucida

Funalia et vectes et arcus
Oppositis foribus minaces.
O quae beatam diva tenes Cyprum et

Memphin carentem Sithonia nive,

10-

Regina, sublimi flagello
Tange Chloen semel arrogantem.

1. idoneus] Orelli’s interpretation, ‘when
I was of an age to love,' quite alters the
true meaning, I think. The words would
be suitable to a youthful lover under the
chagrin of a first disappointment. Ovid
says love is a wal-fare, “Militiae ‘species
amor est, discedite segnes’ '.(A A. ii. 233).

“Militat omnis amans et habet sua castra
Cupid0” (Am. i. 9. l). The arms this
lover proposes to hang up in the temple of
Venus on the left wall, as being most pro-
pitious (see Cic. Divin. ii. 39. 82. “Nobis
sinistra videntur, Graiis et barbaris dextra,
meliora, '——but see also next ode, v. l5, ¹¹5⁹)
are the torch that lighted him to his mis-
tress, the crowbar that broke open her door,
and the bow and arrows which, 1 suppose, 118
carried as emblems of his passion. The last
two words, ‘ et arcus,' Bentley would change

into ⁴ securesque‚⁷ because we hear that
young rakes carried hatchets to break down
their mistresses’ doors if neces

baveno authority for their m'gb'ffot:

and arrows, and probably they did not; but ’

Horace makes his hero hangup his bow, and
that is all we know about it. All the MSS.
agree, and the old commentators take no
notice of the word. Orelli quotes a gloss
111 1118 MS. of Queen' 3 College, Oxford, on
‘zarcus “quibusJ 'anitores terrerent-’³

10. Memphin] Herodotus (ii. 112) speaks
of a temple at Memphis 10 Etiam ’Δφροδίτη,
built by Proteus on the occasion of Paris
and Helen being driven upon the coast of
Egypt, according to a 10881 legend, which
makes him think that Helen herself was the
Ἀφροδίτη” 111 question. When-e Horace got
his notion it 13 1101 easy to say.

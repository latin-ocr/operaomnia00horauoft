was not, as far as 1 am aware, one of the
functions of that goddess. ⁸ Commotus ' is
used for different degi-ees of mental excite·
ment. See v. 209, where the meaning is
the same as here, ⁴ mad.’ Agrippina, who
was of a hasty temper, is called ‘ commotior'
by Tacitus (Ann. i. 33). ‘ Cognata voca·
bula’ means words which may differ in
sound, but are one in sense. ⁸⁸ Diversa

281. Libertinus erat,] The next folly
noticed is superstition. Stertinius tens, by
way of illustration, a story of an old ⁴ liber-
tinus‚’ who went from shrine to shrine

erected in the ‘ oompita‚' spots where two υ

or more streets met, praying to the Lares
Compitales (for whom altars were built in
such placem see above, v. 26, n.) that they
would grant him immortality. This he did
early in the morning, quite sober, and with
hands washed as became a serious wor-

shipper. Now this man was sound in hear-

ing and sight, but, says Stertinius, if his
former master had ever wanted to part with
him, in putting him up for sale he would have
cautioned purchasers that he was not in his
right mind, unless he wanted to get into an
action to'rescind the bargain on the ground
of fraud. It was necessary for a person
selling a slave to inform the buyer of any
bodily or mental defect inhim. See Cicero
de Off. iii. 17 : ‘⁴ In mancipiorum veu-

ditione venditoris fraus omnis excluditurz
fuga, de

qui enim seire debuit de sanitate, de
furtis praestat edicto Aedilium.”

Dig. 21, Tit. l: “Qui mancipia vendunt
certiores faciant emptores quid morbi vitiive
cuique sit, quis fugitivus errove sit, noxave
solutus non sit. eademque omnia cum ea
mancipia venibunt palam recte pronun-
cianto. Quod si mancipium adversus ea

venisset quod ejus praestari oporterediaetur
emptori omnibusque ad quos ea res per-

tinet judicium dabimus ut id mandpium
redhibeatur? On‘ hatis manibusss Comm-
Cruq. says, “quia solebant precaturi deos
manus et pedes abluere. '' The practice
was followed by the Greeks according ω tho
rule stated by Hes-od (Op. etDi. 724, sq.·)

Μηδέποτ* ἐξ ἠοῦς δεῖ λείβειν αἴθοπα οἶνον

Hector likewise says (11. vi. 266).-

For‘ quid tam magnum ' (with which oom-
parePers„ S. v. 120, “thuidtampar-
vum?' '), the old editions and some only
MSS. have ‘quiddam magnum! ‘Quid
tam’ is supported by good MSS„ aad
Cruquius has it in his text· Turnebusamd had
previously sanctioned that reading (⁴⁸⁸
tam' quodinlibro antiquo vidimallem
quam quiddam’ '), and Bgutley and others
have adopted it. ‘Quid. ³ tam
is Heindorf's punctuation, which makes the
words ironical, and rather insolent. Of
Menenius nothing is known, except that
Porphyrion speaks of “Meneniae stul-
titiae vel ineptiae” as a p.roverb

⁴ Illo die ' Porphyrion explains to mean ‘die
Jovis! The Jews fasted on 'I‘hursdays and
Mondays (⁴⁸ Ι fast twice in the week,'' Luke
xviii. 12) in commemoration‚ it is said, of
Moses’ ascent into the Mount on the fisth
day of the week, and of his return on the
second. The practices of the Jews were the
best illustrations of superstition in the eyes
of Horace and men of the world, and their

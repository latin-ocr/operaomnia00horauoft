20 HORATII FLAGGI

Nec tenerum Lycidan mirabere, quo calet juventus
Nunc omnis et mox virgines tepebunt. 20

will always be thus with thee, and will timidly wonder when the tempest ariseth. 1
pity those who have no experience of thee3 for my part Ι have escaped out of the

QUIS multa gracilis te puer in rosa

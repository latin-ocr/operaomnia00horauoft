SATIRARUM Ι. 5.

Tendimus hinc recta Beneventum, ubi sedulus hospes
Paene macros arsit dum turdos versat in igni ς
Nam vaga per veterem dilapso flamma culinam
Volcano summum properabat lambere tectum.

Convivas avidos coenam servosque timentes

Tum rapere, atque omnes restinguere velle videres.
’ Incipit ex illo montes Apulia notos

Ostentare mihi, quos torret Atabulus et quos

Nunquam erepsemus nisi nos vicina Trivici

71. Beneventum] The Appia Via took
a north-east turn from Caudium for ten
miles till it came to Beneventum (Bene-
vento), a very ancient town, by tradition
said to have been founded by Diomed, aud
the name of which was originally, wheb the
Samnites had it, Maleventum, or some name
that sounded so like Maleventum to a Latin
ear that the Romans thought fit to change
it (for good luck) to Beneventum. In 110
town but Rome are there so many remains
of ancient art found as in Benevento. Nearly
au the walls are built of altars, tombs,
columns, &eq and the arch of Trajan, erec·
ted pmbably 111 commemoration of his con-
struction of the road from Beneventum to
Brundusium (since the same year, aa). 114,
appears on the arch that is found ou the
milliarycolumns along the rond), still re-
mains in pretty good preservation. Thither
the party proceeded next day, and put up
at an inn, when the host nearly set fire to
his house through carelessness in roasting
some indifferent thrushea for their dinner.
‘Hospes paene arsit,' the host nearly got
himself on lire, means that he nearly burnt
the house down, as the context shows. The
expression is the same as in Aen. ii. 311 :
“Jam proximus ardet Uealegon.” The posi·
tion of ‘macros' is a little careless3 aud
Inmbinus, followed by most of the editors
of his time and by Fea, transposed ⁴ macros'
and ‘arsitf on the authority of one MS„
the value of which is not known. Bentley
found that arrangement in another of 110
weight. The rest have 011ι Paene macros
arsit!

78. quoe ίαν-01 Atabulus] This Gellius
(ii. 22) reckons among local winds- and
Seneca mentions it (Q. N. v. 17) as infest-
ing Apulia. ‘Atabulus Ap uliam infestat,
Calabriam Iapyx, Athenas Sciron, Galliam
Circius, '¹ Pliny likewise says (N H. xvii.

'‘Flatus Apulis proprius est Atabulus·
111ίο si flaverit cirea brumam exurit frigore

arefadensutnullis solibuspostearecreari

possit.” This may explain‘ torret,' a word
which applies to the effect of cold aa well as
heat.1t is generally interpreted by the
commentatore by‘ 00110000,’ a hoty land
wind. But it came directly off the sea from
the east, and Pliny speaks yof it as a winter
wind. Τ110 Scholiasts all derive the name
ἀπὸ τοῦ τὴν ἄτην βάλλειν, which is an
impossible etymology. Cruquius' Scholiast
says the vulgar corruption of the name was
‘Atabm' which eomes near to the modern
name ‘ Altino!

79. Nunquam nep-remus] This is 0110
of the many abbreviated forms Horace uses.
SeeC. i. 36. 8, n.‚ andtotheexamplesthere
given add the present, and also‘ surrexe,

‘divissest ‘evasti.' ‘Vixet,' in Aen. xi.
118, is a like conti-action of the same tense
as ‘erepsemus.’ Horace says that theywould
never have got out of 111050 111110 (the range
that borders Samnium and separata it from
Apulia) had they not found an inn at the
town of Trivicum, described by Swinburne
(vol. i. p. 130) as ‘a baronial town on an
eminence, and still called Trevico, a mar-
quisate of the Loffredi, a family of Lombard
or Norman origin,'’ at which they were able
to put up for the night. He means the next
stage, which was twenty—four miles further
on, would have been too long a journey.
Horace had been familiar with these moun-
tains in his early childhood, for they over-
looked his native town. ‘ Notos ' refers to
these early reminiscences. ‘Trivicum' is
not mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus,
or the Jerusalem Itinerary. It was pro-
bably on a cross road (Cramer, ii. 259)
which lay between the two branches of the
Appia Via, one of which took the most
direct course from Beneventum through
Venusia to Tarentum and Brundusium, and
the other took a more nor-therly course
across the Apennines, near Equus Tuticus;
and then, striking directly eastward tiu it
arrived very near the seaaooasn near Cannae,
proceeded down the line of coast till it

28 HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN IX.

This is a drinking· -song for the winter imitated from an ode of Alcaeus, of which tho
following fragment has been preserved 1n Athenaeus (34 Bergk).

χιίμων, πεπάγασιν δ’ bada-mv· ρόαι

πῦρ, ἐν δὲ κέρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως
μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ
μάλθακον ‹ipen-1911 γνόφαλλον.

Though the obvious fact that this ode is a close imitation of a Greek writer, might well
lead us to believe that it is a mere work of art, some of the chronologists have found it a
date each according to his own views. Dillenburger thinks it was written soon aster the
battle of Philippi. when Horace’s friends were apt to dwell on unpleasant topioe and re-
quired to have their spirits kept up. J am supposes it was written at the country- -house

of one Thaliarchus, not far from Mount Soracte. Buttmann too thinks this' is a proper
name, (though of course fictitious ,') ln which Ι see no reason to agree with him.

ARGUMENT.

See Soracte stands out with snow, the woods are bending with their· burthen, and tho
sharp frost hath frozen the streams. Heap logs on the fire and draw your best
Sabine wine, feast-master, and leave the rest to the gods, at whose bidding tho fleme
winds are still and the woods have rest. Ask not what is to eome; enjoy the present

day: let the dance be ours while we are young, the Campus Martius, the promonade, ἴ

the nightly assignation, and the coy girl that loves to be caught.

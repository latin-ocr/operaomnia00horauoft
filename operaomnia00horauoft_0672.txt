HORATII FLAOOI

Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam adspice, ne mox
Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.

Fallimur et quondam non dignum tradimus : ergo-
Quem sua culpa premet deceptus omitte tueri,

Ut penitus notum, si tentent crimina, serves

80

Tuterisque tuo fidentem praesidio ς qui

Dente Theonino cum circumroditur, ecquid
Ad te post paulo ventura pericula sentis?

Nam tua res agitur paries cum proximus ardet,

Et neglecta solent incendia sumere vires.

Dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici :

Expertus metuit.

Tu dum tua navis in alto est

Hoc age, ne mutata retrorsum te ferat aura.
Oderunt hilarem tristes tristemque Jocosi‚

Sedatum celeres‚<agilem navumque remissi3

Potores bibuli media de nocte Falerni
Oderunt porrecta negantem pocula, quamvis
Nocturnos jures te formidare vapores.

Deme supercilio nubem ; plerumque modestus

Occupat obscuri speciem, taciturnus acerbi.

generous and make you happy with this
trumpery present, or be cruel and refuse it
you.’ This seems to be the meaning 3 that
is to say, the patron may take it into his
head to gratify his dependant with .a present
of the slave he admires, and then think
he has done enough for him, or he may
refuse to make him the present, and this
would give him pain.

79. deceptus omitte tueri,] ‘When
once you have found yourself deceived, do
not take him under your protection, but
reserve your influence for one you tho-
roughly know, that if need be you may be
able to shelter him from calumnyg for when
the good are slandered what do you suppose
may not happen to yourself ?’ Thce Scho-
liasts say Theon was a man of malignant
wit in Horace’s time, and Comm. Cruq.

house with the present of a ‘ quadrans,’ and

told to go and buy a rope to hang himself.
This is all we know of him.

91. Ροίονεε bibuli media de noete] This
verse is omitted in several old MSS„ in-
cluding all the Parisian, except that two of
the later ones have it as a correction. But

most MSS. have it, and all the editions.
Orelli puts it in brackets, and Bentley sus-
pects it to be an interpolation, but he sub·
stitutes ‘ liquidi’ sor ‘bibuliss and ‘luce'
for ⁴ nocte‚’ if the verse is to stand. His
emendation may be dispensed with, but the
verse must remain till a better oeube found,
for a subject is required sor {odmt’
This, Orelli says, can easily be supplied
from the context3 but there ia no reason
to suppose Horace left the antithesis in-
completa in this case when he has expressed
it so particularlyin the others. ‘ De media
nocte' is ‘after midnight,’ as ‘ media de
luce ' in Epp. i. 14. 34, of which verse this
is a repetition. orelli's explanation, ‘per
mediae noctis tempus,' is not strictly correct.
(See S. ii. 8. 3, n.) . '

93. Nocturnas—vaporem] The ma-
jority of MSS. and the oldest editions have
⁴ tepores‚’ which Bentley also edits. Most
modern editors have, Ι think rightly, on
the authority of some good MSS„ though
against the most esteemed, adopted ‘va-
pores‚' which appears in Asoensius’ edition
of 1519 and most of the sixteenth century.
Either word must be taken to signify the
feverish heats that come on after much
drinking.

CARMEN XXV.

Reddam there are two other odes (hi. 15. iv. 13), the subiect of which is the wauton·
’ nen of heled basatico, ι subject probably handled with still greater pungency by Archilo-
chus, sor it vno one his meacm would find scope in and would be likely to fasten upon.
It in impu-due to ny whethoe Horace had any individui in his mind when he wrote any
one orthae odes. Ifhe lud, we need notgo further and suppose thathe wrote as n dis-
appointed lover. For instance. Jani’u indignation at the virulenoe with which Horace can
find it in his lie-rt to attack (in C. iv. 13) tho woman he was so fond of (in C. iii. 10),
”ems to be moneant-y. But it is a fair spedmen of that matter-of-fact school of inter-
pretation. 1 have before had ooo-sion to remark, how the same principle is applied to
Lydia ‘and how many new lights she appears in (C. 13. Introduction).

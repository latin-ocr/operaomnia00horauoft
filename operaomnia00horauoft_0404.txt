HORATII FLAGGI

N ecne sit addubites, flagret rumore malo cum
Avidos vicinum funus et aegros

Hic atque ille ἓ

Exanimat, mortisque metu sibi parcere cogit;
Sic teneros animos aliena opprobria saepe

Absterrent vitiis.'' Ex hoc ego sanus ab illis -

Perniciem quaecunque ferunt, mediocribus et quis

Ignoscas vitiis teneor-3 fortassis ,et istinc
Largiter abstulerit longa aetas, liber amicus,

Porticus excepit desum mihi.

Hoc faciens vivam melius: Sic dulcis amicis

Occurram : Hoc quidam non belle : numquid ego illi

Imprudens olim faciam simile 3''

Senate and the Equites, are stated very
clearly in Mr. Long' s Excursus on the

father, es plain men ere wont, looked up
with rever-enee to the body in whom were
vested such high functions3 but the offioe
was not an enviable one, nor always most
purely exercised. See C. iv. 9. 39, n. As

129. Ea· hoc eqo sanus] Horace says
that owing ιο his father's training (ex hoc)
he had been kept in a sound end heelthy
state, and preserved from those vices which
in their worst form bring destruction, but
which in 11 moderate degree may be over-
looked. He implies that in this veniel form
he is liable ιο these feults3 but even from
that smaller measure time, the oendour of
friends, and reflection, will deduct a good
deal. Τ110 sentence is a little irregular, but
sufficiently intelligible. ‘ Consilium pro-

himself when he reviews his life, and is bent

number at Rome, end which were usually
crowded by persons of 011 sorte resorting

EPISTOLARUM II. 2.

Romae nutriri mihi contigit, atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum· nocuisset Achilles.
Adjecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae,
Scilicet nt vellem curvo dignoscere rectum,

Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum.

Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,
civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.
Unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

Decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni

42. Iratus Graiis] See Epp. i. 2. 2, ιι.

43. Adjecere bonae] The knowledge
acquir-ed at Athens, and which Cicero says
was valued not by the natives, but only
hy foreigners, who were “ capfi quodam-
modo nomine urbis et auctoritate” (de
Orat. ιιι. 11), was not only philosophy in
all its branches, but Greek literature, with
which Horace became familiar, especially
with the lyric poe-ts, whose works were
probably never taught ιιι the schools at
Rome. But he here only refers to his

. dialeclioel studies, which he pursued ιιι the

school of the A’cademy. The doctrines
taught in Horace' s day were those of the
fisth Aoedemy as it is called, established by
Antiochus of Ascalon, whose teaching
Cicero attended and whom he praises very
highly (see his life in Dict. Biog.). The
different modifications of Plato's doctrine,
introduced by Arcesilas, Carneades, Philo,
and Antiochus, who were heads of his
school at different pericds, may be learnt
from Ritter's Hist. Anc. Phil. Τιιε latest,
which Horacestudied, was an eclectio form,
ιιι which Stoic and Peripatetic doctrines
were incorporated with the Academic. The
head of the Academy at this time was
Theomnastus, whose lectum Brutus at-
tended (Plut. Brut. c. 24). Aristus suc-
ceeded his brother Antiochus (⁴ quid illa
vetus Academia atque ejus haeres Aristus. ²'

cic. Brut. c. 97), and Horace may have been
at Athens while he was teaching. But he
could not have been alive when Horace left3

for Brutus was his intimate friend (Plut.
Brut. c. 2), and would not have attended
Theomnaems if Aristus had been still
teaching. Academus was an Attio hero,
and there was a spot of ground about three
quarters of a mile from the city, on the
banks of the Cephisus, which was dedicated
to him and planted with olives, and called
asta* his name, Academia. Here Plato

taught, and from hence his school was
named.

44. curvo disy-noscere recinens] ‘ Curvum'
is used here like ‘pravum ' for ⁴ falsehood.'
Persius uses it in the same derived way
(iv. ll), ‘⁴ rectum discernis ubi inter Curva
subit vel cum fallit pede varo.''

48. non responsura lacertis. ] Not des-
tined to match the strength of Augustus.
(SeeS. ιι. 7. 85, ιι.) Inthefirstengagement
at Philippi (A. u. c. 712), Brutus defeated

the forces of Augustus and got possession .

of his camp ,while M. Antonius on the
other hand defeated Cassius, who destroyed
himself. But twenty days asterwards a
second engagement went against Brutus,
and he likewise put an end to himself.
How Brutus attached to his cause the
young Romans studying at Athens, and the
battles and wanderings he led them through
are related by Plutarch ιιι his life (c. 24,
sq‘il. Et laris et sumis]
equivalent to ‘ domus! As to the difference
between ‘ domus ’ and fundus,' see S. ii. 5.
108, ιι. Horaoe’s patrimony was of course
forfeited because he was of the republican
party. Others in his neighbourhood lost
theirs in consequence of the distribution of
lands to the soldier-s (see S. ii. 2. Introduc-

fion). He says nothing of the scribe’s
place, which Suetonius says he bought (with
what means does not appear), nor does he
mention how he got his pardon and per-

mission to return to Rome. He only says
he was driven by poverty to write verses,
which therefore he first wrote for fame,

that is to bring himself into the notice of
those who were able to relieve his wants, as
hIaecenm did. It is impossible to tell what
he wrote at first. The language of the
text does not necessarily imply that he was
paid for what he wrote; but though Horace
never appears in a mercenary character,

‘Laris’ is

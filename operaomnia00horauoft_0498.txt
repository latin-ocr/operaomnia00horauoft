tioned. The ordinary story of Polydorus,
the son of Priam, is that which Euripides
relates in the Hecuba, that he was entrusted
to the care of Polymestor, king of Thrace,
and murdered by him for his gold. Another
legend (see Dict'. Biog. ⁴ Polydorus ’) makes
him entrusted to the care of his sister
Ilione, who was wife of the above Poly-
mestor. She, for 'some reason, put himin
the place of her own son Deiphilus, and the
latter was brought up as her brother.
When the Greeks took Troy they required
Polymestor to put Priam’s son to death,
and he accordingly killed Deiphilus. On
this story Pacuvius founded a tragedy called
Ilione, and in one of the scenes the ghost
of Deiphilus is introduced in his mother's
bed-chamber, calling upon her to give his
body burial in these words (preserved in
Cic. Tusc. Disp. i. 44) :-

⁴‘ Mater, te adpello quae curam somno sus-
pensam levas,
Neqqpattlpmmei miseret3 surge et sepeli

Fufius acted Ilione, and Catienus was Dei-
philus. The former was so drunk that he
fell fast asleep, and Horace says if 200,000
Catienuses had screamed in his ear he
would not have heard them. His part was
to start up and cry to the vanished ghost,
like Hamlet,—“ Age, adsta, mane, audi,
iteradum eademmet ista mihi '' (Cic. Acad.
Prior. ii. 27). Cicero made a proverb of
these words, ‘ Mater, te appello: using them
in various illustrations. See his speech pro
Sestio, c. 59.

68. quam praesens Mercurius serm]
This notion appears to be taken from a
painting; at least the language calls to
mind that of Persius (vi. 61, sqq.) :—

“Qui prior es cur me in decursu lampada
Sumptiliiclliercurius: venio deus huc ego¹
Pingiltiirlile An renuis? Vin tu gaudere
, relictis?”

It is common, in ancient works of art, to
see Mercurius represented with a 'purse in
his hand, and his wings on his cap or feet,
offering the former as in haste to some
figure by him. In Montfauoon's collection
(vol. i. pl. 76. 2) he is represented, on a
gem, offer-ing his purae to For-tune, who
has her hands fun (a cornucopiae in one
and a rudder in the other, as usual), but
shows by her face that she is ready to take
it. Spence has an engraving fromanancient
picture (Polymetis, Pl. xv. 4). in which
Mercurius offers his purse to Minerva, and
she, with the discretiori that belongs to her,
is taking only a little of the money it con-
tains; while on a gem, of which a copy is
given in the same plats, he is offering it to
a female, who, Spenoe suggests, may be
Pudicitia, and who rejects the ‚offer nith
disdain. The last gem, in which the god ia
evidently in the act of taking his departure
hastily‚ illustr-ates the text very well. ‘ If
I offer you a purse of money as a free gift:
says Stertinius, ‘ are you mad if you accept
it ? Is not he the fool who rejects the trea-

sure that Mercurius in his bounty offers, ¹

seeing he may never be so kind again ?'

69. Scribe decem Nerio ;] This is a
difficult passage. In the first place it may ·
be doubted who is the speaker of these ,
words. They appear to me to be meant for
an invective of the money-lenden· Pei-illiue

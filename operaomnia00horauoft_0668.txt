14. partes mimum tractare secundam]
‘Secundas agere' is a phrase taken from
the stage. On the Greek stage there were
only three actore, who were called πρωτα-
γωνιστὴς, δευτεραγωνιστής, τριταγωνισ-
τής respectively. (See A. P. 192, n‚). In the
Roman plays and ‘ mimes' there was no such
specific distinction3 but as on our own
stage there is always one principal actor
that takes the lead, while the rest act parts
more or less subordinate, so it was with the
Romans; and ‘ secundas agere,' though it
sometimes applied to a particular actor
if there were any more prominent than
the rest, was applied to au except the
chief, especially in the mimes, which con—
sisted chiefly of dumb show, and in which
the inferior parts were all arranged, and
the actors played, so as to support the
principal character. In most cases one of
the parts was that of a parasite. Torren-
tius quotes the following story from Sue-
tonius (Calig. 57), which illustratos this,
and shows that ‘secundae' was applied to
the inferior parts generally: “ Cum in
Laureolo mimo, in quo actor proripiens se
ruina sanguinem vomit, plures secundarum
experimentum artis darent, cruore scena
abundavit.'' Here the man who played
the principal part is called simply ⁴ actor!
The subordinates were also called ‘adju-
tores' (See S. i. 9. 46. n.)

⁴15. de lana saepe caprina,] This is
plainly equivalent to ‘ nothing at all! The
Greek proverb corresponding to this, and
usually quoted in this place, is περὶ ὄνου
σκιᾶς μάχεσθαι, founded upon a story told
in court, according to the Scholiast on
Aristophanes (Vesp. 131), by Demosthenes.
A man hired an aSS, and in the heat of the
day lay down iu the shadow of the animal,
whereupon the owner turned him out of
his place, saying he had hired the ass, but
not his shadow; and on this they went to
law.

else, and boldly bark out what 1 knowto be
true! Why if you would give me my life
over again Ι would not accept it on such
conditions! , ,

19. Castor sciat an Dolichos plus ,·]
This is the same sort of gossip that Mae-
cenas is represented as discussing with
Horace (S. ii. 6. 44, sqq.). The Scholiasta
say that these persons were players or, as
others say, gladiatore. Comm. Cruq. has
the name Dolichos, and cruquiua was the
first to adopt it on his Scholiast's authority
and that of three MSS„ which have never
since been confirmed. Most of the modern
editions have Dolichos. Bentley retains
Docilis, the reading of Porphyrion and all
the *old editions. Orelli says this name
occurs in inscriptions as that of a freedman,
but he prefers the other. 1 feel no eer-
tainty about it. If Dolichos be right, the
name is that of a Greek slave, derived stom
Doliche, a town of Thessaly.

20. Brundisium Minuci] “The northern
part of Samnium was naver-sed by a road
which communicated with the Velm-ian,
Latin, and Appian ways, and, aster urossing
through part of Apulia. fell into the Via
Aquilia in Lucania. There is reason for
arrabea ...mh
be difficult from this description to follow
the road, and the writer’s map does not
help us. It is only once more mentioned
by any classical writer (Cic. ad Att. ix. 6:
“ Cohortesque sex quae Albae fuissent ad
Curium via Minucia transisse”), and all
we leam from that is, that the rond pas-ed
by Alba, which lay between the Via Latin·
and Via Appia, about half-way between
Tusculum and Aricia. Continuing in that
direction it would fall into the Via Latina
at 'reanum in Campania, a little above
Capua, from which place the Via Appia
was continued to-Brundisium. If this were
the line of the Via Minucia (it is impossible
to say any thing about it with certainty), it
would be a more direct route than the Via
Appia, but it was probably a worse road.
The MSS. and editions vary between the

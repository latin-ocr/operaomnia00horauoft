336 HORATII FLAGCI

SATIRE II.

This Satire appears to have been written on the death of Tigellius,a musician of great re-
pnte, who, as we leam from the opening verse of the next Satire, was on terms of familiar
intimacy with C. Julius Caesar. The Scholiasts who call him M. Hermogenes Tigellius
say that he afterwards became a favour-ite with Cleopatra, and then again with Augustus.
Acron says Horace quarrelled with him because he found fault with the rhythm of his
verses. Itis probable that this Tigellius is miscalled M. Hermogenes, and that this
name belongs only to another Tigellius who was also a singer mentioned in S. 3. 1293
4. 72ς 9. 25; 10. 18, 80, 90. These persons had never been separated till Dades·
distinguished between them. Heindorf adher-es to the old opinion, which I think has
been satisfactorily disposed of by Kirchner in his treatise “ De Utroque Tigellio ”
(Quaest. Hor. p. 42, sqq.). The Tigellius of this Satire is called Sardus, a Sardinia, in
the next (v. 3). It appears from the Scholiasts that he was attacked by Licinius, from
whom they quote this verse: ⁴⁶ Sardi Tigelli putidum capnt venit.” He was probably
therefore a libertinus. Cicero had a quarrel with this person, whose influence with
Caesar was such that it made him rather anxious, though he affects in some of his letters
to hold the man cheap. Compare Epp. ad Fam. vii. 24. Ad Att. xiii. 49, 50, and 51.
He too alludes to Licinius' verse, and calls Tigellius “ hominem pestilentiorem patri.
sua (the climate of Sardinia was counted very bad) addictum jam dudum Calvi Licinii
Hipponacteo praeconio ’' (Ad Fam. 1. c.). The character of Tigellius is drawn cleverly
in the opening verses of the next Satire.

The statement of the Scholiasts on v. 25 of this Satire, that some supposed (so Porph-
and Comm. Cruq. put it; Acron says at once “Maecenatem tangit'’) that, under tha
name Malchinus, Horace means to satir-ize Maecenas, seems to me unworthy of the least
credit. But it has had warm defenders, and upon this assumption the date of the Satin-e
is fixed, both Kirchner and Franke placing it in A.u.c. 714, in order to allow sufficient
time between the composition of the libel, and the introduction of Horace to his panon.
I will not trouble the reader by going into the argument, except to say that, if the libel
was keen enough to offend, it is as improbable Horace would have pnblished as that he
would have written it, after his introduction·to Maecenas3 and if (as appears to me) there
is nothing to offend in the verse, it was as probably written after as before their acquaint-
ance began. But I do not believe Maecenas had any thing to do with the verse at au.
An early date must be assigned to the Satire, because it certainly preceded the 4th, and
that again was composed before the 10th of this Book. Whether the coarseness of the
ideas and language, and the want of artistic arrangement and connexion, may not be au
argument for an early date, deserves consideration. (See >Introduction to S. 4.) It is
without exception the coar-sest of all Horace's Satires, and, with reference to the point
it professes to turn upon, the least to the purpose. I can trace no connexion between
the text which is contained in v. 24 (“ fools trying to avoid one class of vices run into
their opposites ”) and the licentious language and advice contained in the latter half
of the Satire, which in brief amounts to this: ‘ do not let a false ambition lead you
into intriguing with married women, but make yourself happy with prostitutas! The
examples which appear to bc to the purpose are not so in reality. Tigellius, we may be
sure, did not give his money to harlots and impostors in order to avoid the character of
a miser 3 nor did Fufidius drive hard usurious bargains, cheat young men with good ex-
pectations, and deny and torment himself, in order to avoid the charge of extravagance.
If one man wore his tunic down to his ancles it was because he was slovenly or effeminate;

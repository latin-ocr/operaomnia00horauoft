212 HORATII FLAOOI

ARGUMENT.

Come, Maecenas ; the wine, and oil, and the flowers are ready. Stay not for ever gazing
from a distance at the pleasant fields of Tibur, buried in the magnificence and the
uproar, the wealth and the smoke of the city. The rich man often likes to sup at the
poor man’s table. The days of drought are come back; the shepherd seeks the shade,
the flock seeks the stream, not a breath is on the river-banks: but thou art distracting
thyself with imaginary dangers. Heaven has wisely hidden the future from man, and
does but smile at his fears. Live for the present ; all else is like the stream that now
flows in peace, now is swollen to a flood and sweeps all with it to the sea. He lives
happy who lives to—day and leaves to-morrow to Heaven, seeing that Jove himself ean-
not undo what is done. As to Fortune she is fiekle, and changes from day to day. If
she stays with me I am glad, if she flies I am resigned. If the storm rages 1 have no
merchandize to sear for, and can put out into any sea with safety 111 my little bark.

TYRRHENA regum progenies, tibi
Non ante verso lene merum cado
Cum flore, Maecenas, rosarum et

Pressa tuis balanus
J amdudum apud me est.

Ne semper udum Tibur et Aesulae

Declive contempleris arvum et
Telegoni juga parricidae.

Fastidiosam desere copiam et

Molem propinquam nubibus arduis;

Omitte mirari beatae

Fumum et opes strepitumque Romae.
Plerumque gratae divitibus vices,
Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum

l. Tyrrhena reyum proyenies,] Com-
pare C. i. l. l. ‘ Verso’ is equivalent to
‘moveri’ in “moveri digna bono die ''
(C. iii. 21. 6). Τ110 ‘balanus' was an
oleaginous nut of some kind, and is here put
for the 011 expressed from it.

5. Eripe te morae ,·] On this use of the
dative see Key's L. G. 978.

6. Ne semper udum] The MSS. vary
between ‘ne‚' ‘nec,’ and ‘nou.' Orelli
prefers the abrupt form, which Dillenbr.
says is ‘ing-ratum! Ι rather agree with
Orelli, though ‘nec' would do very well.
Horace uses it in prohibitions (C. i. 9. 15; 11.
2; 111. 7. 29). It appears that Maecenas
was sighing for the country all the time he
was detained at Rome. Telegonus, son of
Ulysses and Circe, was the reputed founder
One of the
legends of Ulysses’ death attributes it to
this son. Aesula was probably a town be-

of Tusculum and Praeneste.

tween Praeneste and Tibur, but no tmoes
of its site remain, and Pliny says that it no
longer existed in his time (iii. 5). See Cra-
mer (It. ii. 66).

10. Molem] This significa Maeeenas’ pa-

lace on the Esquiline hill at Rome. It is
mentioned in Epod. ix. 3.
ll. Omitte] This is the only instance
in this book of an iambus at the beginning¹
of the third verse. It occurs four times in
the first book and twice in the second. It
does not occur in the fourth.

15. aulaeie et ostro] Τ110 meaning of
‘ aulaeis ' is explained 111 Sat. ii. 8. 54:
‘⁴ Interea suspensa graves aulaea ruinas
fecere,'' where Porphyrion tells us it was
usual to spread tapestry to catch any dust
that might fall from the eeiling. ⁴ Aulacia
et ostro ' may form one subject, or ‘ ostro’

may mean the coverings of'the couches.

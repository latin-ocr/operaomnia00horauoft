rooms in the upper story of houses which
went by the name of ‘ insulae,' the inhabit-
ants of which were called ‘coenacularii,’
and they who kept them were said ‘ coena-
culariam exercere! In such a room Vitel-
lius lodged with his wife and children.

according to Suetonius (in vit. c. 7), and
Martial lived up three pair of stairs (i. 113):

“ Scalis habito tribus sed altis.” Other
distinguished literary men lived in garrets
then as they have since. Suetonius tells us
of Orbilius a celebrated grammarian, that
he was so lodged: ‘¹ namque jam persenex
pauperem se et habitare sub tegulis quodam
scripto fatetur'' (de illust. Gram. c. 9); and
Valerius Cato we learn from the same
treatise (c. ll) passed the latter years of a
long life in the same sort of abode. Sue·

tonius quotes some bitter lines of Furius
Bibaculus (see S. i. 10, Exc.), in which he
describes Cato as one—-

‘⁴ Quem tres cauliculi et selibra farris,
Racemi duo tegula sub una,
Ad summam prope nutriant senectam.”

It seems to have been usual for annual
tenants to change their lodgings on the
Kalends of J uly. Martial describes the flit-
ting of a poor family with all their property,
which he enumerates in an amusing way.
The Epigram (xii. 32) begins—

“ O Juliarum dedecus Kalendarum
Vidi, Vacerra, sarcinas tuas, vidiss’

(SeeBek. Gall. p. 6, ιι. Eng. Trans.) Ho-
race speaks of persons changing from
caprice and aping the ways of the rich.

92. conducto naviqio] ‘Navigium' ex-
presses the vulgar craft which the poor man
hires in imitation of the private yacht, as
smartly built and well found as a trireme,
belonging to the rich man. He hires his
boat, which he cannot afford to do, and
goes through the horrors of sea-sickness‚
that he may have the honour of serving as
a foil to the elegance of his wealthy neigh-

' from ‘indum'

bour. Orelli thinks it very probable Ho-
race is here drawing a picture of himself, as
in S. ii. 7 (where see note ou v. 23), and he
commends the sagacity of Cruquius, who
first suggested that notion. 1 see no merit
in it at all.

94. Si curatus inaequali tonsore] He
goes on to tax Maecenas with the prevail-
ing inconsistency. A very few MSpS„ in-
cluding one of Cruq uius', have ‘curta’tuffl'
which that editor, qLambinus, Torrentius,
and others, have edited. Bnt‘ comas' or
¹ capillos curare’ was a common expression.
Domitian wrote a book ‘de cura capillo-
rum, ' according to Suetonius (c. 18), which
he addressed to a friend who was bald
like himself. Orelli' s strange explanation
of the construction, making‘ ineq nali
tonsore’ an ablative absolute, has eqbeen
mentioned on C.' 1. 6. 2. ‘Subiicula’ was a
second tunic worn under the ‘intusium,'
which was the upper tunic. ⁴ Pexse ’ signi-
fies a eloth of which the nap was not closdy
shorn and was still fresh (“ pexusque toga-
que recenti,'’ Pers. S. i. 15). The uppet-
tunic therefore would be new while the under
one was old and shabby. The ‘subucula’
had sleeves, which the ‘intusium ' had not.
Any difference therefore in the eloth would
be very perceptible. Out of doors the
toga would conceal both, but in· doors
was not worn. ‘Intusium’ is
‘Subuculass Varro says -
(Ling. Lat. v. 30), is derived from‘ su'btus. ⁹
Itis more likely connected with‘ duo’ (that
is, ‘do ') likewise. Martial has this kaeu
epigram (ii. 58) on one who wore fine
clothes he had not paid for:

the toga

“Pexatus pulcre rides mea, zone, hila.
δαῖἑῃῖωο trita quidem, Zoilo, sed mea

‘ Disconvenit ' is a word only found in Ho-

race. It occurs again Epp. 14. 18.

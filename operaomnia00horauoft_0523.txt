ones, and the spring was the best season
for them. See Martial (xiii. 43):

But-11 such fungi had tobe chosenwith
great care. Ενέιιι the boletus served to
carryoff an emperor. See Juvenal, l. c.,
and Martia] i. 21.

24. Aufidius] Estre thinks this may be
M. Aufidius, who was remarkable as having
been the firstatRomewho bred andsat-
wned peacocks for sale, and derived a large
profit (as much as 600 ,000 soeteroes a year)
from that trade. (Pliny, N. H. x. 20. 23;
VarrodeR.R.iii...61) This nis
also identified with Μ. Aufidius Lurco, who
was tribune of the plebs A.u.c. 693, and
author of the Lex pAufidia de Ambitu.
(See his Life in the Dict. Biog.) 1 am not
aware that there are sufficient grounds for
eitherof these conjectures As to the com-
position os ‘mulsum' see noto on S. ii. 2.
15, n. Falernian wine, which Horace appears
to have oeteemed next to Caecuban‚ is here
called ‘ forte.’ and elsewhere ‘ severum ’ and
‘ardens’ (C. i. 27. 93 ii. ll. 19). It was
a very strong spirituous wine, and required
long keeping to become mellow. For-syth
(Italy, p. 261) stopped at Santa Agata (a
modern town in the Falernus Ager) in the
hope of getting some real Falernian ; but he
found it very inferior to the Formian which
he had lately drank at Mola (Formiae).

27. morabitur] This may have been a
medical word for costiveness. Forcellini
does not notice this use of it. ‘Mitulus,'
the limpet, is noticed aa among the ‘ vilium
conchae ' by Martial (iii. 60):

“Ostrea tu sumis stagno saturata Lucrino3
Sugitur inciso mitulus ore mihi.''

The Greeks called it τελλίνη or ξιφύδρων.
The ‘lapathus¹ is mentioned above as a
purgative (Epod. ii. 57, n.) ‘ Brevis„’
which Porphyrion interprets ‘ short-lived,' as

“breve lilium '² (C. i. 36. 16), refers rather,
as Orelli says, to the size of the plant.

30. Lubrica nascentes] That shell-fish
were best at the time of the new moon,
appears to have been generally believed
among the ancients. Gellius, in a chapter
(xx. 8): “de iis quae habere συμπάθειαν
videntur cum luna a nte ac sene-
scente,'’ mentions that while he was dining
with his friend Annianus the poet, at his
country seat, there arrived a large supply of
oysters from Rome, which proved to be
poor shrivelled things, and the host ac-
counted for it by the fact that the moon was
then on the wane, quoting Lucilius :

‘⁸ Lnna'alit ostrea et implet echinos, muri-
8ζέοὲῧῶ

The same heaffirmsin raepect to cats¹ eyes,
that they get larger as the moon increases,
and smaller as she wanae. The ancients
had many fancies respecting the influence
of the moon on various objecta, in which
however modern ignorance and superstition
have perhaps snrpassed them. But in re·
spect to shell-fish, Henry Swinburne, whose
amusing account of his travels in the Two
Sicilies in the years 1777—1780,1 have
often quoted, says: ‘⁴ It is an obmtion

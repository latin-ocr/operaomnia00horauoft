HORATII FLACCI

Ut Argonautas praeter omnes candidum

Medea mirata est ducem,

10

Ignota tauris illigaturum juga
Perunxit hoc J asonem3
Hoc delibutis ulta donis pellicem

Serpente fugit alite.

Nec tantus unquam siderum insedit vapor

Siticulosae Apuliae,

15

Nec munus humeris efficacis Herculis

Inarsit aestuosius.

At si quid unquam tale concupiveris,

J ocose Maecenas, precor

Manum puella savio opponat tuo
Extrema et in sponda cubet.

therefore he became enamoured of her in
her old age, she could not have been an old
woman when he gave her this name. The
boy in Ep. v. 98 is made to curse her and
her fellows, and to predict that they will be
stoned for a set of wicked old women, and
Priapus describes her with false teeth (S. i.
8. 48); but these need not be taken literally.
In Ep. xvii. 47, Horace says she is not an old
woman 3 and there is no reason to suppose
she was, though most probably she was not
young. It is impossible, from Horace’s
poems¹ to gather the cause of his anger
against this woman or his connexion with
her. If Gratidia was her real name, the
fictitious one was framed on the principle
noticed C. ii. 12, Introduction.

9. praeler- omnes] Orelli directs us to
take these words with ‘candidum,’ not with
‘ mirata est! I prefer taking them with
the latter. Horace assigns opposite qualities
to the poison in Medea’s hands. It protecta
Jason and destroys Creusa (or Glauce) his
betrothed. (See Epod. v. 63.)

15. insedit vapor] ⁴ Vapor' is equivalent
to ‘mlorf the effect to the cause (see romeu.
for examples, and also of ‘ efficax '). ⁴ Side-
rum vapor' is the heat of the dog-days.
Compare Ep. xvi.61 t “ Nulliusastri erogem
aestuosa torret impotentia.” The arid un-
watered character of Apulia has been no-
ticed before (C. iii. 30. 11). South of the
Aufidus there was not a stream fill you
reached the Galaesus near Tarentum. This
caused the arrangement mentioned by Varro
in the passage quoted on Ep. i. 27. The
northern part of Apulia was better vata-ed,
and was consequently very fertile.

17. Nec munus humer-1⁶2] i. e. the gur-
ment smeared with the blood of Nm,
given by Deianira to Hercules. βω Epod.

xvii. 31.

21. savio opponat tuo] The editors
generally have ‘savio,' and not ‘suaviot'
Foroell. makes them both the me word,
and says they were from ‘mm' Jahn,
in loco, denies this, and says ‘navium‘
means ⁴ a lip!

to have come into the country prepared to
produce something worthy of his fame.
The books he would bring with him would
be of a kind suited to his purpose, which
the vuitings of the comedians and of Archi-
lochus, the bitterest of all sat-irists, would
be. I do not see what Plato, the philo-
sopher, has to do with Menander, Eupolis,
and Archilochus, or the design for which
Horace is supposed to have carried them
into the country with him. Plato’s come-
dies were greatly admired by his contem-
poraries. Their character also in some in-
stances approximated to that of the New
Comedy. Plato is on this account asso-
ciated with the so-called Middle Comedy;
and so if we take Menander to represent
the new, and Eupolis the old, we shall have
all the three styles of Greek comedy here
assembled. I observe by Orelli’s note that
C. Passow under-stands ‘ Platona ' ιο mean
the writer of comedies. Dacier did the
same. I am inclined to agree with them.
‘Tantos ' Acron refers to the *size of the
volumes, Orelli to the greatness of the
writers. Perhaps Horace meant both :
ὃιλόγως, as Baxter would say.

13. virtute relicta ?] I have more than
once had occasion to remark that the notion
of perseverance is involved 111 ι118 Roman
‘virtus' (See C. S. 59), and it is so here,
being opposed to ‘ desidia ' (v. 15). But it
means more, for it implies moral courage
and 8 strong will, which were in great esteem
among the Romans. Damasippus supposes
the poet to be consulting his ease and his
cowardice at the same time ; and says if he
thinks to silence jealousy by ceasing to
write, 118 will only find himself the object
of conoempt3 and if he means ιο be idle
now, he must be content ιο lose the re-
putation won in his better days of energy.
As to ‘ Siren,' see Epp. i. 2. 23.

16. Damasippe,] See Introduction.
Horace prays, 111 the words of 8 common
formula, that heaven will send Damasippus,

wrewardhimforhisgoodadvice,abnrber
to shave his long heard. He may be sup-
posed to have let his heard grow long with
the affeetation peculias ιο those who called
themselves philosophare: and Horace means
that to be delivered from that fouy would
be the best boon that could be bestowed
upon him. (See below, v. 35, and note on
S. i. 3. 133.) Aulus Gellius (N. A. ix. 2)
tells a story, of which 118 was an eye-mmm,
of a man going ιο Herodes Atticus, ⁸‘ pd-
liatus et crinitus barbaque prope ad pubem
usque porrecta,'¹ and asking him for money
to buy bread. When he was asked who he
waS, he answered in a tone os repro-:ch that
118 was a philosopher, and that he was sur-
prised that Atticus should ask a question
which his own eyes would enable him to
answer. The good man's reply was, “ Video
barbam et pallium, philosophum nondum
video.'' ἐκ πώγωνος σοφοὶ was the Greek
way of representing such persons,-men
whose wisdom lay in their bearda-

18. Janum Ad medium] 'rbere appu-r
to have been three arches dedicated to
J anus in the Forum Romanum, one at each
end, and one in the centre, near to the Αισιιι
Fabianus at the extremity of the Via Sam.
They are alluded to again Epp. i. 1. 54:
“ Haec Janus summus ab imo Perdocet;”
i. e. the whole Forum. Neu· the middle
arch were the ‘ tabernae' of the principal
money-lenders. Cicero mentions¹ them (de
Off. ii. 25): “de quaerenda, de collocanda
pecunia, vellem etiam de utenda commodius
a quibusdam optimis viris ad Janum medium
sedentibus, quam ab ullis philosophis nlla in
schola disputatur.”

20. Olim nam] This position of ‘nam '
is peculiar to the poets. See below, v. 41,
and elsewhere.

21. vafer — lavisset Sisyphus aere, ]
Homer (11. vi. 153) calls Sisyphus κέρδιστος
ἀνδρῶν. Damasippus says he used, before
118 lost all his money, ιο employ himself
in purchasing and re-selling all kinds of

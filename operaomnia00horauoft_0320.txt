CARMEN VI.

Τ113 Scholiast Porphyrion says of this ode that it is directed against some man who
was given to attacking virulently unoffeuding persons. Acron says his name was Cassius,
and that he was a slanderous poet. Compounding these statements, and amplifying them
from his own head and the language of the ode, Cruquius’ Scholiast makes Cassium to be
Cassius Severus, an orator of great celebrity and bitterness, who was bauished by Augustus,
and after remaining in exile for twenty-five years died a beggar Am. 32, more than 3131,-
three years after the composition of this ode. This Scholiast's authority is destroyed by
1113 own description of Severus, who, he says, was very abusive and attacked the beot of
111311, but was easily appeased by filling his belly and plying him with money, for which
reason Horace compares him to 3 dog, &c. This is the language of a mere compilor, 31111
13 worthy of no credit. Τ113 silence of Porphyrion, aud the positive statement of Aciun
that the Cassius of this ode was a poet (which we have no authority for supposingSeverus
was), as well as the extreme youth of Severus at the time it was written, are 311 opposed
to the 11011011 that he 13 1113 person attacked; and moreover so far from being the cown'd
Horace describes, Severus boldly attacked men of influence, and suffered for doing θος
and 33 10 1113 avarice, it was through persisting in the course his nature inclined him 10,
of indiscriminate abuse, that 113 031113 to destitution and died in that condition. Al-
though therefore Comm. Cruq. has been followed by 311 1113 editors till the present
century 31111 by some 1313 commentators; and though Weichert has done his best to
support this opinion, I do not think he has succeeded. It may be allowed that Acron
had some ground—we know not what—for calling the man Cassius, aud if so the
notorious orator would occur to the copyists and those by whom the inscriptions were
framed, who were as ignorant as we are of the real Cassius. Estre has, with his usual
exactuess, given all the authorities from whom the life of Cassius Severus has been eom-

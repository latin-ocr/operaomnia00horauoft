A.U.c. 725 (ἵ).

Notwithstanding Agrippa's clooe connexion with Augustus, it is very probable that
between that εἰει-ιι man and Horaoe there was but little sympathy or interamnae, and
without personal affection his muse did not rise to its highest flights in the way of per.
sonal eulogy. And during the time that he was writing the odes which eompooe the
threan-st books, judging by their character we may believe that he really felt unequal or

’ indispoeed for singing the pmisae 0f a mmm-y hero, aad that he considered such subjm

unsuited to him. Twiee he ehecks himself when he gets upon heroic theme-1 (C. ii. 1.

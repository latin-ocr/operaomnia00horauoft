586 HORATII FLAOOI

buted to the same year as Epp. 15, when Horace was meditating 8 winter maiam on
the coast. But the date of that Epistle is also quite uncertain, and Horace in all'pro-
bability passed most of his winters elsewhere than at Rome.

ARGUMENT.

Ι promised to be back 18 8 few days, and now 1 have been a whole month away. But
you let me 8ο because 1 was sick, 8811 now you will excuse me, I know, it· 1 am afraid
of this fatal season. And when the snow shall show itself 011 the fields of Alba, Ι shffl
go to the sea coast and take 0818 of myself, with my books, and return, deal· ffiand,
with your permission, with the return of the swallow. Yours was not the liberality or the
unmannerly Calabriam who praesed his pears upon his guest, and when he still poliffly
1180118811, concluded with “ as you please ε if you do not eat them the pigs wiu.” ’ 'rho
spendthrift gives away what he does not care for,—a generosity that does but breed
ingratitude. Τ118 good man gives to those who desei-ve, but he knows the valne of
money. 1 then will try and be deserving in proportion to the goodnoes of my bene-
factor. But if you will have me always live at Rome, give me back the strength and
cheerfulness of my youth.

A little fox chanced to get through a cranny into a vaesel of corn, and when he had caten
his fill tried to get out, but could not. ‘⁴ Lean you went in and to leannaes you must
return if you would get out,” said a weasel hard by. If any 088 says the same to me,
Ι 881 ready to give up all. 1 don’t praise the repose 8811 fi-eedom of the couno-y only .
because 1 have my belly full of dainties. I would not exchange it for the wealth of

Arabia. You have often witnessed and commended my reverence for you, and have γ

heard me oeJl you my father and my king; but see if 1 cannot cheerfully restore 811
you have given me. Well did Telemachus reply when Menelaus offered him horsea:
‘⁶ Ithaca hath no room for horses, thou son of Atreus; thy gists 818 18018 suitable for
thine own keeping, and there Ι leave them.” Ι am a humble man: 1 love not tho
splendours of Rome, but the ease bf Tibur and the sostness of Tarentum.

When Philippus, that stout orator, was returning home from the Forum, tired and out of
spirits, he saw one sitting in 8 barber's shop lazily pax-ing his nails: Δ· Go,' 88111 he to
his slave, ‘ go and find out who that man is, and all about him! He proves to be one
Mena, a crier, of small means and good character, and well known as an active, sensible
man, well content with his condition. ⁴ 1 should like to hear all this from himselfx
invite him to dine with me.' The man can hardly believe his ears : however hebegs to
be excused. Philippus was surprised, bnt next morning saw the man at an auction
and repeated his invitation, and it was accepted. The dinner went off agreeably, 81111
was osten repeated till the man became 811 established guest. One holiday he went
with his patron into the country, and was delighted with all he saw. Philippus saw an
opening for a joke, and persuaded the man to buy himself a piece of ground. To make
a long story short he was soon turned into a farmer, talked of nothing but husbandry,
and worked himself to death. Then come losses: his sheep are stolen, his goats get
the rot, his crops fail, his steers are worn out, till he can stand it no longer, but mounts
his horse and rides off to Philippus, 81111 entreats him by all he holds sacred to restore
him the life he has lost.

And so let every man do who has found out that he has made a bad exchange. Let him
go back to his first estate ; and let each take care to measure himself by his own
standard.

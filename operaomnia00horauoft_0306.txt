Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,

Turdis edacibus dolos,

Pavidumque leporem et advenam laqueo gruem 35

J ucunda captat praemia.

Quis non malarum quas amor curas habet

Haec inter obliviscitur?

Quodsi pudica mulier in partem juvet

Domum atque dulces liberos,

Sabina qualis aut perusta solibus

Pernicis uxor Apuli,

Sacrum vetustis exstruat lignis focum

Lassi sub adventum viri,

Illae ignem sonitumque pavent, diffusaque
Avlizilqgilrtiiiiturque suum decrescere montem 3
Donec in angustam ceciderunt undique val-
Inifiijd’ vicem stupuere greges, socioque

Plutarch, in his life of Alexander speaks
of toils twelve miles long. The poets,
Latin and Greek, used the feminine gender
in speaking of hunting-dogs‚ as mares
are more often mentioned than horses
for the race. ‘ Amites ' were forked stakes
on which the nets were stretched. ⁴ Plagae ’
were the strong nets mentioned above;
‘retia' were finer ones for birds and fish3
‘retia rara' were those with wider meshes
than fishing-nets, and therefore used only
for birds. ⁶ Edacibus ' represents their de-
predations on the corn, which 1 mention
because Doering applies it to their greedy
seizure of the bait. The next line is said
by its numbers to represent the rapid course
of the hare and crane. If so, Doering con-
trivoe to annihilate tho poet’s purpose by
his punctuation,

“ Pavidumque leporem, et advenam, laqueo,
Jugfllgelrg„ captat, praemia,'’

by which itis intended I suppose to show
that ‘laqueo ' represents the instrument of
capture, and is not to be taken with the
word that goes before it as if Horace meant
to say that the crane was ‘advena laquem'
an error not likely to occur very readily.
If Doering is not misrepresented by his
English editor, superfluity of punctuation
was a great defect with him. 1 do not

see that the sound in this linc repreoenu
the sense. It rather halts than ssies-
‘ Laqueo ’ may be pronouncsd ss a dissy —
lable. γ

39. in partem] ‘On ber part! The
Greeks said ἐν μέρει. ⁴ In partem ' ocmrs
in Plautus (Asin. iii. 3. 89), ‘⁴ Age sis m in
partem nunc jam hunc delude.”

41. per-vasta solibus] Theoe. (x. 28)=
Βομβὺκα χαρίεσσα Σύραν καλέοντί τυ
πάντες Ἰσχνὰν. ἁλιόκαυστον, ἐγὼ δὲ μόνος ’
μελίχλωρον. -

42. Pernicis] ⁴ Pernix' signifies patient,
stedfast, being compounded of ‘per’ and
⁴ nitor. ' (Servius on Virg. Georg. ὦ. 93.)
When applied to motion it comes to mean
swiflz, by the natural consequence of ssteady
movement of the wings or fest, which
accomplishes distance more rspidly than
irregulm· speed.

43. Sacrum vetustis] 'rho fise-plu»
was sacredto the Lares. 'rhewoodmust
be old that it might not smoko like that
which plagued the travellers at Trevicum
(S. i. 5. 80) :—

¹⁴ —— lacrymoso non sine fumo,
Udos cum foliis ramos urente camino.”

The ⁴ focus’ was either a future of stone or
brick, in which case itwassynonymous with
¹ caminus‚' or it was moveable and made of
bronze, and then it was called ‘foculus’
In either case it was a wide and shallow

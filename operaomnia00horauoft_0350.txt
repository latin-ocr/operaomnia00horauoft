320 HORATII FLAOOI

Tibi hospitale pectus et purae manus,
Tuusque venter Pactumeius, et tuo 50
Cruore rubros obstetrix pannos lavit,
Utcunque fortis exsilis puerpera.
Quid obseratis auribus fundis preces?
Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis
Neptunus alto tundit hibernus salo. 55
Inultus ut tu riseris Ootyttia

Et Esquilini pontifex venefici
Impune ut Urbem nomine impleris meo!

nine days’ continuance,’ but it cannot have
that meaning here. Hector was buried aster
nine days (11. xxiv. 784) :—

‹Obsoleta’ is applied in an unusual sense.
It usually signifies that which is gone to
decay (out of use), as clothes, housae, faded
pictures, διο. (see Forcell.), and so it comes
to mean generally that which is spoilt and
worthless. See C. ii. 10. 6.

50. Tuumne venter Paetumeiue,] In
Epod. v. 5 it is insinuated that Canidia is
chssdless, that the children she pretends to
have are not hers, and her childbirths are a
fiction, perhaps to extract money from her
lovers on whom her pretended children were
affiliated. Here the libel is withdrawn, but
in such a way as to leave it untouched, for
in the last line he insinuates that her travail
is at least not very difficult. ‘Venter' is
used by the law-writers to signify the child
in the womb, or a woman with child. (“ De
Ventre in Possessionem Mittendo,'' Dig. 37,
tit. 9.) Quintilian also (Declam. 177):
‘¹ Illa igitur prior damnavit ventrem suum:
victurus autem fuit ille si ego adnltream non
occidissem.” Tacitus uses ‘ uterus ' for the
child after birth (Ann. i. 59 ; xv. 23). See
Forcell. under both words. The name
‘ Pactumeius’ appears as ‘ Partumeius’ in
some MSS.‚ which Bentley calls “malae
notae codices.” Fea quotes many more,
and defends the reading strongly. Lam-
binus adopts it, Turnebus, Torrentius,
Dacier, and others. Ascensius too, much
earlier than any of them. But the Scho-
liasts and the editions of the fifteenth cen-

tury knew nothing of that word, which is
founded on a filthy nofion unworthy of
being entertained, though its defendet:
think it a elever joke. ‘Pactumeius' is a
Roman name, as Bentley has shown from
the jurists and inscriptions. Ven. has‘ pac-
tum ejus,' and that 1 suppose to be the
reading of all the editions descended from
the same stock and bearing Landinuu'
commentary: but it will neither scau nor
construe, and is only an argument for ‘ Pac-
tumeiusf though Dacier says that name has

‘ni grace ni sens!

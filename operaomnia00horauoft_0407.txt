who in hia censorship (amoc 441) cou-
structed the Via Appia and the great
aqueduct which bore his name. Some
ruinsof this townare said by Walckenaer
stillto exist. Its modern name isBorgo
Lungo. “Wertm mtis2p1enum,sc.

Theputicip 18ι differtus' isformed as from
‘differdof which verb 18 1101 found. ‘Dif-
fertus’ occursbelow (Epp. i. 6. 59);ι ‘Differ-
tum transire forum! ” Fea follows the Scho-
11881 111 18111113 ⁴ malignis' absolutely. It
no doubt belongs 1ο ‘cauponibus’ in the
881118 881188 as ‘perfidus bic caupo' (S. i.
29). It was to Appii Forum that some of
1118 christiam, when they heard of St. Paul’s

, went from Rome to meet him.
Othcrsmethimataplace calledTrae
Tabernae (In Castella), which was about
seven miles from Aricia, and sixteen from
App ii Forum. Horace must have passed
through this town without stopping. lt
was awell-known place, and from it a
Christian bishop took his title,‘ ‘Felix a
hilm Tabernisss'

5. Hoc iter] i. e. the journey from
Rome to Appii Forum, which was usually
made' ιιι 0118 day, they took two to accom-
plish. ‘Praecinctus' is opposed to‘ dis-
cinctus‚' and means one wellgirtss εὔζωνος,
andready for active exertion, running, διο.
Horace uses the word more liter-ally, S. ii.
8. 7⁰: “ut omnae Praecincti recte pueri
comptique ministrent? Servius quotes this
place in his note on Aen. viii. 724, saying‚
‘⁴ Vel habitum eorum ostendit qui usque ad
talos fluebat—vel discinctos dixit inhabiles
milites: omnes enim qui militant cincti sunt·
vel inefficaces ut contra praecinctos strenuos
dicimus. Horat. Altius 88 nos Praecinctis
unum. ” The Asianos tuck up in their
girdles their long garments when theyare

&pm-ing to run or walk quick. Hence

m 0118 88 we meet with ιιι Scrip-

‘Gird up the loins of your mind. ”
‘Succinctusl ‘tucked up, ’is the more usual
6. mmm est yravu Appia turdis]
“Appia via non est molesta tardioribus
quia habitaculis frequentabatur ubi possunt
manere quocunque pervenerint’' (Acron).

This interpretation is followed by many of
the commentatore. Orelli and others think
Horace means that the Via Appia was less
fatiguing to the slow traveller than to the
quick; that it was a rough road, over which
the slower you went the less unpleasant was
the' Journey .—There is a reading ‘nimis’
adopted byy Fea upon the same. understand-
ing. road was constructed with 8
foundation of largesq uared blocks of stone,
over which was laid a coating of gra,vel

found on a mile-stone in the neighbourhood
of Forum Appii, and noticed by De Chaupy
(111. 391): ‘⁴ nn». cusan nsnva auc.

smnravrr.” Horace speaks elsewhere of
the traveller ⁴ ‘ qui Romam Capua petit imbre
lutoque Adspersus'' (Epp. i. ll. ll). 1
think with Orelli that Horace means the road
was bad, and that they who took the journey
leisurely escaped jolting and inconvenience.
In one of the verses of Lucilius' Satire men-
tioned in the Introduction he says, ‘⁴ Prae-
terea omne iter est labosum atque lutosum.”
7. Hic eqo propter aqueum] ‘⁴ Hodie in
Foro Appii viatores propter aquam quae
ibi deterrima est manere vitant. Dicit
ergo Horatius se ibi coenare noluisse ne
necesse haberet bibere” (Porphyrion).
At Appii Forum they were to embark at
nightin aboat that was to carrythemby
canal to Terracina. A party were waiting
at the same inn to go with them. and
Horace waited with ιιιι patience till they had
done supper. These he means by ‘ comites)
This 881181, which was constructed by Au-
gustus in hisattempt (A. P. 65)todrain the
Pomptine marshes, is referred to by Strabo

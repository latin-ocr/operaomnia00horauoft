Gur ita crediderim nisi quid te detinet audi. 5
Fabula qua Paridis propter narratur amorem

Graecia Barbariae lento collisa duello

Stultorum regum et populorum continet aestus.

Antenor censet belli praecidere causam:

Quid Paris? Ut salvus regnet vivatque beatus
Nestor componere lites

cogi posse negat.

10

Inter Peliden festinat et inter Atriden;
Hunc amor, ira quidem communiter urit utrumque.
Quidquid delirant reges plectuntur Achivi.

seditione, dolis, scelere atque libidine et ira

Iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra.
Rursus quid virtus et quid sapientia possit
Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulixen,

Qui domitor Trojae multorum providus urbes

Et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor,

Dum sibi dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa
Pertulit adversis rerum immersabilis undis.

commendatior: of 3 short treatise of his,
‘de Luetu.’ The earliest 'editions have
‘planius ac melius 3' and Acron, in his
commentary, has ‘manifestius et melius ς’
Porphyrion‘ melius et aptius, ' which I take
tobe ‘apertiusss If so, both 111030 Scho-

. · liasts confirm the reading ‘planius’ The

Blandinian MSS. had‘ plenius? so have
most of the Parisinu, butp the 0111031 of all
has ‘planius‚' and three others. The
St. Gallen and Bernc have the latter, and
five of Fea's Vaticans3 with many others
quoted by Lambinus, Torrentius, Cruquius,
and Bentley, who 103101·οᾱ ‘ planius ' aster
it had been banished more than 3 century.
I find ‘ plenius ' in the Venetian edition of
15431 think‘ planius' suits the context
better. Chrysippus is said by Diog. Laert.

ἰ · (vii. 180) to have written more than 700

volumes: sothat‘ plenius' wouldbe rather
out of place, though Obbarius, who retains
it, supposes Horaoe to mean that there was
more instruction in Homer than in all the
volnmes of Chrysippus put together3 but
he also means it is more clearly conveyed.
(See Introduction.)

7. Barbariae] That is, Phrygia. (See
Epod. ix. 6.) ‘ Aestus ' is a metaphor from
the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and
represents the passions and variableness
os the princes and people.

At 3 meeting of the
'lh-ojan chiefs aster the combat of Hector
aud Ajax, Antenor proposes to 1031018
Helen to the Greeks, which Paris flatly
refuses, ἀντικρὺ δ’ ἀπόφημι γυναῖκα μέν
οὐκ· ἀποδώσω (ΙΙ. vii. 362, sqq.).

12. Inter Peliden- inter Atriden ;] See
S. i. 7. 11, n.

13. Hunc amon] From its position this
seems to belong to ⁴ Atriden.’ The allusion
is to Naewr’s attempt to mediate between
Agamemnon and Achilles, when t-he former
angi-ily consents to restore Briseis, whom
he loved above clytemnestra his wife (11. i.
113, sqq.).

19. domitor ijae] The epithet πτολί-
πορθος 13 frequently applied to Ulyssae by
Homer. OEcero accounts for it in a letter
to Plancus (x. 13), in which he urges him
to follow up the victory of Brutus at Mutina,
and to crush M. Antonius: “Qui enim
M. Antonium oppresserit is bellum con-
fecerit. Itaque Homerus non Ajacem nec
Achillem (which is 311 oversight) sed Ulixem
appellavit πτολίπορθον.” Τ110 three first
νει-303 of the Odyssey are almost tranen lated
in these lines. ‘Immersabilis' is like
άβάπτιστος 111 Pindar (Pyth. ii. 80)
ἀβάπτιστός εἰμι, φελλὸς ὣς ὑπὲρ ἕρκος,
ἅλμας. Compare C. iv. 4. 65: “Mersa

9. Antenor censet]

- profundo pulchrior evenit'’

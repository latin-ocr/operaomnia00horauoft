HORATII FLACOI

may write tragedy; Varius bold epics; Virgil bucolics3 my strength lies in thatstyle
in which Varro and others have failed, though Ι am not equal to Lucilius who invented
it. I have no wish to rob him of the crown that is his due.

But I said the flow of his verse was that of a muddy stream, carrying with it more faults
than beauties. Well, do you never find a blot even in Homer, with all your learning?
Did not Lucilius find faults in Accius and in Ennius? Why may not Ι inquire whether
it was from the nature of his mind or of his subject that Lucilius wrote clumsy verses,
such as any one would write who thought more of quantity than quality, like Cassius
whose books were burnt on his own funeral pile? Grant him all the wit and eloquence
you please, yet if he had lived till now he would have corrected much that he wrote, and
taken more pains than he did.

If you want to write well correct what you write, and look for the approval not of the
multitude but of the few. You are not ambitious surely of your verses being hacked
in cheap schools. If you are I am not. I look for the applause of better judgea. Am
Ι to be put out by the abuse of a vulgar rabble? Let my noble band of learned and
loving friends be pleased and I want no more. Demetrius and Tigellius may go and

Quis tam Lucili fautor inepte est

1. Nempe incomposito] See Introduc-
tion.

3. At idem] ‘⁴ ‘At’ denotes rather addi-
tion than opposition. It is commonly em-
ployed after a concession’' (Key’s L. G.,
1 445). The concession here is in ⁴ nempe.’
‘ You say and I admit it, still in the same
satire I praised him!

4. defricuit] This word is nowhere
else used in this sense. It means to give
a hard rub, as we say. There are other
vulgarisms in our own language akin to this
expression.

6. Et Laberi mimos] Laberius was the
most distinguished writer of this particular
kind of play that we know of. Particulars
of his life will be found in the Dict. Biog.
He died the year before the battle of
Philippi, Ast-c. 711, and therefore before
this Satire was written. The Roman
mimes were in the time of Laberius re-
presented in the theatres with the regular
drama, and were accordingly, we may be-
lieve, of a higher order than those repre-
sentations which at an earlier period bore
this name, though still they appear to have
been of a licentious character. Tbey were a
combination of grotesque dumb-show, of
farcical representations in verse-dialogoe, of
incidents in low and profligate life, and of

grave sentimenta and satirical allusions inter-
spersed with the dialogue. Of these, as in
the Atellanae Fabulae, the first element
chiefly prevailed. That class of representa-
tion was gradually superseded by the mimo,
which came to be in great favour. This
appears to have been the only purely
Roman conception of the Drama for
though the name is derived from the Greek,
the characters of the Greek and Latin
mimes were essentially different. That
they were very popular we know. When
Ovid would excuse himself to Augustus,
he writes (Trist. ii. 497, sqq.):
‘⁴ Quid si scripsissem mimos obscaena jo,-
cantes, ¹
Qui semper juncti nomen amoris ha-
bent?
In quibus assidue cultus procedit adulter,
Verbaque dat stulto callida nupta viro.
Nubilis hos virgo matronaque virque
puerque
Spectat, et e magna parte senatus
adest;'’

and he goes on to say that Augustus himself
was a great patron of these licentious repre-
sentations. From a prologue written by
Laberius (and preserved in Macrobius) on a

famous occasion, on which Julius Caesar

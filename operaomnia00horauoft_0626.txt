HORATII FLAGGI

EPISTLE IX.
ΛΑΜ). 734.

As to Septimius, on whose behalf this Epistle is addressed to Tiberius, see C. ii. 6,
Introduction. Τ1ιο occasion was that journey into Armenia which has been referred to
twice before (Ep. 3 and 7). It is a well-considered and careful productiori: Horace
would have written more warmly sor such an intimate friend if he could have ventu-red to
do so; but the character of Tiberius did not admit of warmth, and he would not have

responded to any very eat-nest eulogy. Horace therefore satisfies himself with merely
naming his friend and excusing his own boldness' m doing so.

This Epistle is noticed' m an amusing article of the Spectator (No. 493) on the subject
of introductions and testimonials ιιι general, of which this is quoted as a judicious speci-

men, and a loose translation is there given.

SEPTIMIUS‚ Claudi, nimirum intelligit unus

Quanti me facias3 nam cum rogat et prece cogit

Scilicet ut tibi se laudare et tradere coner,

Dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis,

Munere cum fungi propioris censet amici, 5
Quid possim videt ae novit me valdius ipso.

Multa quidem dixi cur excusatus abirem ;

1. nimirum] ‘Of course‚’ it would be
strange if it were otherwise. Horace some-
times uses the word seriously‚ sometimes
ironically‚ as in S. ii. 2. 1063 3. 120. He
says ‘Of course Septimius knows my in-
fluence with you better than any body
else does (⁴ unus‚’ see S. ii. 6. 57, ιι.), and
better than 1 do myself, and thinks that Ι
stand to you in the relation of an intimate
friend, or he would not press me for an in-
troduction! There is about the same amount
of ironical meaning in ⁴ scilicet! ⁴ Tradere'
is the usual word for introductions. (S. i.
9. 47.) ‘Munere fungi’ is like ‘officium
facio' below (Epp.·l7. 21). It means to
discharge the duties of friendship, but
generally expresses the relation of an in-
ferior w one above him in rank, and some-
times is used in a bad sense to signify
servility.

4. Diynum mente domoque] Tacitus
says of Tiberius, summing up his character
(Ann. vi. 51):‘ ‘Morum quoque tempora
illi diversa: egregium vita famaque, quoad
privatus vel imperiis sub Aug usto fuit:
occultum ac subdolum fingendisg virtutibus,
donec Germanicus ac Drusus superfuereff’

His genuine character, he says, did not come
out fully till after the fallof Sejanus. Atthis
time he was about twenty-two years of age,
but even now was reserved and unpleasant
in his manners, so much so that evan Au-
gustuscouldhardly becheerfulin hiscum—
pany. Suetonius thinks Augustus had no
very good opinion of him· “sed vitiis vir-
tutibusque perpensis potiores duxisse vir-
tutes” (c. 21). Horace spealxs well of him
not only here, when he is writing to himself,
but in Epp. ii. 2. 1, written probably at a
later time, to his friend Julius Florus. The
fourteenth Ode of the fourth book was
written in honour of his successes, but theme¹
1 think no great amount of warmth is shown
in his favour. ⁴ Domo' means his family.
Tiberius was the son of T. Claudius Nero,
and the Neronae belonged to the patriciali
gens Claudia, which numbered many oon-
suls and other high magistrates from the
first establishment of the family in A.u.c.
250. They were of Sabine origin.

6. valdius] This comparative occurs
again in A. P. 321 t

l ‚ ‘⁶ valdius oblectat popu-
um. ’

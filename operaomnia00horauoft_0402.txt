A puero est causaque mea permulta rogatus

phyrion ). “ Cujus amicus erat, '' adds
Cruquius' Soholiast, who says he was called
Capitolinus from his imputed offence. But
this was probably a cognomen of the Pe-
tillia gens. Lambinus mentions having
seen at Rome a silver coin, having on the
reverse a representation of the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus, and the name of Petil-
lius. On the obverse was Jupiter's head
with Capitolinus round it. Such a coin is

crown is very likely to have been invented.
That he was tried on some serious charge
and acquitted, and that the vei-dict did 11οι
escape scandal, is clear from the context.
See also S. 10. 26. The nature of the ae-
cusation, notwithstanding the precise story
of the Scholiasts, must remain a matter of
doubt. We may also gather that he was a
person of influence from v. 97, which he
must have been if he was acquitted, or sup-
posed ιο have been acquitted, through the
corruption of the jury. There is sarcasm in
‘sed tamen admiror,' &c., which Horace
calls ‘ succus loliginis,’ the dark secretion of
the cuttle - fish, black aud malignant.

that eats into character and destroys it.
Compare Martial (x. 33. 5) 2—-

Forte malus 'livor dixerit esse meos,
Ut facis, a nobis abigas.''

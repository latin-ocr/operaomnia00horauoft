HORATII FLAGGI

Inguen ad obscoenum subductis usque facetus;
Pastillos Rufillus olet, Gargonius hircum.

Nil medium est.

Sunt qui nolint tetigisse nisi illas .

Quarum subsuta talos tegat instita veste;

Contra alius nullam nisi olenti in fornice stantem.

Quidam notus homo cum exiret fornice, “ Macte
Virtute esto,'' inquit sententia dia Catonis.

Nam simul ac venas *inflavit tetra libido

Huc j·uvenes aequum est descendere, non alienas

Cicero charges Verres with the same effe-
minacy: ‘¹ Quum iste cum pallio purpureo
talarique tunica versaretur in conviviis
muliebribus, non offendebantur homines ''
(Act. ii. 1. 5, 0. 12). A great deal has been
written upon the identification of Maecenas
with this person (whatever the name may
have 110011), 81111 of Agrippa with the oppo-
site character in the next verse. But either
notion appears to me equally improbable.
See Introduction. The idea of Maecenas
being the strutting coxcomb of Horace's
Satire is incredible (see below, v. 64). The
tunic was worn down to a little below the
knees by civilians not entitled to wear the
‘latus clavus ι’ women wore it down to the
ancles: military officers not so low as the
knee (see Quintil. xi. 3. 138). ‘ Facetus'
is what we might call ⁴ fine! Plautus applies
it to di1)1ing as Horace to dressing (Mostell.
i. l. 41 :—

⁴¹ Non omneslpossunt olere unguenta exotica
Neqiie ttiiiiti {cetis quam tu vivis victibus.”

27. Pastillos Rufillus olet‚] ‘ Pastillus'
is a diminutive of ‘panis,’ and signifies a
small roll; whence in a derived sense it
came to mean small balls of perfume of
some sort. Horace quotes this verse of his
own in S. 4. 92 of this book, 85 showing the
harmless quality of his satire. who Rufil-
lus and Gargonius (which name appears 85
Gorgonius in the old editions) may have
been we cannot tell. Bentley identifies
the latter with a person of the same name
mentioned by the elder Seneca in his book
Suasoriorum (c. vii.) as 811 indifferent
orator. That they were persons of some
note Orelli infers from the fact that Horace’s
ridicule of them had made him enemies, as
appears from the passage quoted above from
the fourth Satire. But it does not appear
that in that place Horace means more than
to illustrate the inoffensive character of his
satirical writings, nor can Orelli's inference I

think be sustained. Rufillus is probably only
a diminutive of the common name Rufus,
invented for this fop, though we meet with
the name Rufina in Tacitus (Anu. iii. 36).

29. Quarum subsuta] The ordinary
dress of the Roman ladies was an 11111101·
tunic without sleeves, called ι1111ῑ115111111;’
over this they wore another tunic called
⁴ stola‚' at the bottom of which 'ran aflounee,
‘instita,’ called by 0110 of the Scholiasta
(Com. Cruq.) ‘ tenuissima fasciola’ (which
description of its width, however, has been
disputed. See Becker's Gallus, Exc. ‘ou
the dress of the women '). The ‘stols’
was longer than the person, and after form-
ing several folds under the breast, fell to
the feet.
‘ instita subsuta vesti! The same Scholiast
says the ⁴ instita' was called by the Greeks
περιπέδιλον. Out of doors the women
wore a ‘palla' oorresponding to thomae
‘toga' See S. 8. 23, 11.

31. Macte Virtute θείω] 111 this plu-mo
(for examples of which see ForcelL) ¹ macte:
the vocative of ‘ mactus’ (⁴ magis auctus')
is put where the nominative would be more
regular, and ‘ virtute ' 15 the ablativa of the
means. ‘ May thy virtue prosper theel'
(see Key's L. G. 1004). ⁴ Sententia dia
Catonis ' is equivalent to ‘ Cato divine
sapiens.' Compare S. ii. l. 72: “Virtus ·
Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,” and C.
i. 3. 36, n. Acron tells this story: that
Cato (the elder) was passing the door of a
brothel, when a young man (whp, socord-
111001ξὲξὲἔέ ἰηῗέᾞὶῗὲἒξῗ ἐωῗῖἷιὲ f
when he saw Cato he tried to get out of his
way, but the censor called to him 81111 00111-
mended him3 but afterwards seeing him,
otten issuing from the same place, he said,
“ Adolescens, ego te laudavi tanquam in-
terdum huc venires non tanquam hic habi-
tares.’' The reason of his oommendation
15 explained in the two next verses on very
loose principles of chastity.

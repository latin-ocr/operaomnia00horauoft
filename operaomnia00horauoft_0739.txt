128. Difficile eet proprie mummia
dicei-ex] ‘Communia' means here what
every body knows, or what is common pro·
μετ’, aa opposed to fictions of oue’s own
oneng, and* proprie dicere’ is to tellit
mastomakeitone’s own. Horaceseems
to be using terius which have distinct legal
significations without strict secui-acy. ‘Pro-
prie communia dicere’ seems to be the
nme aa making that which is ‘publica
materies’ ‘pu-inii juris,' which last is a
lsffl ἴσω. ‘Communia' is usual in the
saise of puniership property, and is dif-
fluent fmin ⁴ publiea3' but here it seems to
havetheaamemeaning. Horace seemsto
have followed a Greek proverb, χαλεπόν
τὰ κοιναὶ idibem. As to ‘deducis' see S.i.

136. ue scriptor cyclicus olim .·] A class
of Epic poets arose some time aster Homer,
who, perhaps from the habit of reciting as
rhapsodists the Iliad and Odyssey‚ were led
to adopting subjects akin to Homa’s, and
connecting theirJ poems with liis; and their
design appearing to have been to’form their
poeuis and Homer’s into one cycle, em-
bracing the whole history of the Trojan
times,they oemetobe calledbythegra'in-
mariansCyclic poeta. Osthaeethe oldest
was Arctinus of Miletus, whose poem was a
continuafion of the Iliad, and nearly as
long. It took up the history afta· the
death of Hector, and related the arrival of
the Amazons and Ethiopians to assist the
Trojans, the death of Achilles by the band
of Paris, the oontoet of Ajax and Ulysses
(toldby Ovid, Met. xiii. l, sqq.,) the story
of Laocoon aiid of the wooden horse, and
the consequent sacking of Tmy.V'1rgil
wasindebted to this poem for thegreater
part of the second book of the Aeneid. It
was divided into two parm, of which tho
first was called stolone, the second Ἰλίαν
πέρσις. Tine second Cyclic poet in order
of time was Laechoe, a Iasbian, aud contem-
porary with Archilochus. His poem m
known as the Μαιρὰ Ἰλιὰς. The poem
opened with thoee two linoe, which Ilm-ace
may ormay not havehadinmind:

ῐλων ἀείδω ml Δαρδανίην εὔπωλον,
ἧς πέρι πολλὰ πάθον Δαναοὶ Θεράποντες

It appears to have embraced a number oi
different subjoets, among others the stoi-‚vot
Philoctetes told in Sophocles’ play. See
Aristone (Poet. 23), where also reference
is made to another Cydic poem mlled
Κύπρια, from the birth place of theauthor
Stasinus, which was intended as an inim-
duction to the Iliad of Homer, and sm-

Nunc age luxuriam et Nomentanum arripe mecum:

Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes. 225
Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,

Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, auceps»,

Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum,

·' Mane domum veniant.

Quid tum? Venere frequentes. 230

Verba facit leno: Quidquid mihi, quidquid et horum
Cuique domi est, id crede tuum et vel nunc pete vel cras.

The mad ritea of the Bellonarii‚ the priests
of thia goddess, who cut their own floeh to
offer the blood in sacrifice, are mentioned
by Lucan (ἰ. 562):

‘⁴-—--'1·umquos aectisBellona lacertis

ppear ιο have been impostore
who,profeasingto be inspired byBellona,
peace of the‘city with their
ures. Martial mentions them among the
nui-noes osa town life (xii. 57. ll): “Nec
turba cessat entheata Beuom’*

to Ην] (ii. 14) and Dion. Halic. (v. 36)g‚
from a body of fugitives from Pomena's
army, who were hospitably entertained by
the Romans, and allowed to occup ythis
meet. Itap appears to have been filled with
ahorn, some apparently of the better sort.
Martial speaks of the richest silks being

characters were found there (Cumul. iv. l.

21):‘ ‘In Tusco vico ibi sunt homines qui
ipsi sese venditant? The Velabrum· rs said
by Varm (Ling. lat. iv. 8) to have derived
its name from the verb‘ vehere,¹ because
the ground was originally a swamp naver-sed
byboats. Here too there appears ιο have
been a collection of shops of the better
sort: ‘⁴ prostabant omnia quae ad victus ra-
tionem atque delitias pertinebant” (Comm.
Cruq.). There were in earlier times diffe-
mtmarketafor the sale ofdifferent pro-

⁴ forum boarium ' sor oxen,
‘olitorium ¹ for vegetables, ⁴ piscar-ium ' and
⁴ piscatorium ’ for fish, ⁴ cupedinis ¹ for deli·
acies, &c- These were asterwards (the
time is uncertain) all transferred to one
large mar-ket on the site of the‘ forum cupe-
dinisss on the north sideof the SacraVia,
not far from the Forum Romanum. This
market was called Macellum, the diminu-
tive form of· maceria, ’,the wall with which
it was surrounded (aee Cic. inVerr. ii. 3.
62, Mr. Long’s note). Varro says it was
from one A. Macellus, a notorious robber,
who had a house' ιιι this place, which, when
he was banished, was pulled down, and on
the spot was built with the money realized
by the sale of his property this market-plaoe.
He also derives Forum Cupedinis from the
names of one Numerius Equitius Cupes,
an accomplice of the above Macellum bnt
these etymologias are not ιο be trusted.
See Terence (Eun. ii. 2. 24)ε

‘⁴——interea loci ad Macellum ubi ad-
ventamns
Concurrunt laeti rni obviam cupedinarii

‘Fartoroe’ Becker (Gallus, sc. ix. n.) says
were σιηῢι-αι, whose businaeswas to fatten
fowls. The ⁸ scurrae? parasitos, were sent
for to help to consume all this quantity of
provisions, and ιο entertain the new heir.

230. Quid tumf] This is the reading
of all but a very few MSS. Bentley found

‘qui tum' in one, and changed it to‘ qui
cum‚’ which reading has since been found
in three MSS. by Fea, who adopts it.

‘Quid enim? is another various ς

‘quid tu?' a third; but this is only‘ quid
tum’ with the mark (ῡ) omitted. The
common reading is not likely to have been
introduced if Horace had written ⁴ qui
cum!

232. vel nunc pete vel eras-J This
sounds like a conventionalism for ‘when-
ever you plenae)

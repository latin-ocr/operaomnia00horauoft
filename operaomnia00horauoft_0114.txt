Ausa et jacentem visere regiam

HORATII FLAGOI

25

Voltu sereno, fortis et asperas
Tractare serpentes, ut atrum
Corpore combiberet venenum,
Deliberata morte ferocior,

Saevis Liburnis scilicet invidens

Privata deduci superbo
Non humilis mulier triumpho.

the sight of men! It is said that Cleopatra
eontemplated quitting Egypt to escape from
Augustus, and that she transported vessels
across the desert to the Red Sea: but they
were destroyed by the Arabs, and she aban-
doned her design. Plut. Ant. c. 69. On the
word ⁴ reparavit' see C. i. 31. 12, n. Bentley
proposes ¹ penetravit,’ but without altering the
meaning of the passage, which is sufficiently
ι . , .
51²5& ‘3⁸53 ῗῖὶιιῖἳῖἒηέἔέρὲἓὲ ζὲὶῗὲῗὲιῖῑῖῗ
has ‘repetivit' Bos proposes by the ad-
dition of one letter to make it ⁴ ire paravit’
(Animad. p. 36). Orelli gives various other
conjectures, as ‘ repedavit‚’ ⁶ peraravit,’ ⁴ re-

meavit‚' ⁴ recreavit‚’ ⁸ properavit} ¹ trepi-
davit.'

25. jacentem] One MS. appears tohave
‘ taeentem,¹ which Bentley approves ap·
pealing to C. iv. 14. 36: ‘¹ vacuam patefecit
aulam.” Because Cleopatra’s palme was
not pulled down. he thinks ‘ jaoentem' in-
appropriate and unhistorioel. On Cleo-
patra’s death, &c. see Plut. Ant. e. 84.

30. Liburnis] See Epod. i. 1, n. The
Scholiast Porphyrion relatos on the sutho-
rity of Livy that Cleopatra having the pros-
pect of being mrried to Rome used to
exclaim οὐ θριαμβεύσομαι. The passage is
not to be found in Livy's extant work.

CARMEN XXXVIII.

‘⁴ The only two persons‚” saystranke, “ who know when this ode was ertten are
Kirchner and Grotefend. The former assigns it to A.u.c. 729, the latterto 725.” It
may be said in favour of the former, that he expresses a doubt upon the subject by.
max-king the date with a (?). The words were probably written as a song and set to
music. Ι leam from Jani that Voltaire had a contempt for this ode, and that forhis
dist-espect he was well punished by the illustrious Schmid: “egregie depexum dedit
cl. Schmidius.'' There is not much to remark upon it one way or the other. No gre-t
pains are usually bestowed on such matters. Some suppose it to be a translation, others
an original composition. lt is probably only a good imitation of Arzamon. The time
is supposed to be Autumn (v. 4).

ARGUMENT.

thou shouldst seek for aught save the myrtle‚ which will do* for thee the sm-vnnt and
for me thy master drinking under the shade of my vine.

Pmsmos odi, puer, apparatus,

Displicent nexae philyra coronae3

Mitte sectari rosa quo locorum
Sera moretur.

called by the Greeks3 and its thiu inner were sown to form the richer kind os chap-

HORATII FLAGGI

Sermo oritur, non de villis domibusve alienis,

Nec male necne Lepos saltet; sed quod magis ad nos
Pertinet et nescire malum est agitamus: utrumne
Divitiis homines an sint virtute beati;

Quidve ad amicitias, usus rectumne, trahat nos ;

Et quae sit natura boni summumque quid' ejus.
Cervius haec inter vicinus garrit aniles

Ex re fabellas.

Si quis nam laudat Arelli

Sollicitas ignarus opes, sic incipit: ‘⁶ Olim

Rusticus urbanum murem mus paupere fertur

Accepisse caVO, veterem vetus hospes amicum,
Asper et attentus quaesitis, ut tamen artum
Solveret hospitiis animum. Quid multa? neque ille
Sepositi ciceris nec longae invidit avenae,

mane die, dicimus uvidi Cum sol Oceano
subest.”

72. Nec male necne Lepos saltet ;] Lepos
was a ‘ pantomimus ’ who was so named
according to the Scholiasts, and as the name
itself imports, “quod jucunde et molliter
saltaret et eloqueretur.” The business of
the ‘ mimi‚’ as ofthe ‘ mimae ' (S. i. 2, 2, 11.),
1188 to recite poetry as well as to act parts
in the farces that bore the same name (S.
i. 10. 6, 11.). The word ⁴ saltare ’ was ap-
plied to all pantomimic acting and the
motion of the limbs in dumb show. See S.
i. 5. 63, where Messius calls upon Sarmentus
to act Polyphemus—“Pastorem saltaret uti
Cyclopa rogabat,'' where ⁴ saltaret' is equiva-
lent to ‘ movetur ’ in “ Nunc Satyrum nunc
pastorem Cyclopa movetur '¹ (Epp. ii. 2.
125). Torrentius says, “ in veteri libro ad-
scriptum, Lepos Caesaris archimimi no-
men.”

7 5. usus rectumne] Cicero makes Laelius

indignantly deny the doctrine that makes'

utility the foundation of friendship‚ and he
says with much truth and delicacy“ non
enim tam utilitas parta per amicum quam
amici amor ipse delectat'' (Lael. c. xiv.).
There‘ 18 more in the same sti-ain in c. viii„

where he makes virtue the basis of friend-

ship. Ovid (ex Pont. ii. 3. 7) says mouru-
fully enough ε

“Turpe quidem dictu sed (si modo vera

fatemur) ·
Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat.''

The other subject, ⁴ natura boni summum-

que‚’ is discussed at large in Cicero’s treatise
⁴ de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum‚’ and was
a common place in Horace's day, as it has

been· m all ages. ‘Summum' represents the
Greek τέλος, ‘the end ppro osedf so fre-
quent in Aristotle and the philosop hers.

77. Cervius] This was an old ne' nghbom·
of Horace' 8, and that’ 18 811 118 know. Estre
supposes he may have been one of the five
persons who had houses on Horace’ s estate
(Epp. i. 14. 2); but there is not the smallaet
clue to his history or to that of Arellius
below, who however must have been 8 rich
man and careful about his money.

78. Si quis nam] The old editions have
nearly all ‘nam si quis,' but the MSS. are
mostly in favour of ‘ si‘ quis nam,’ which
Bentley restored to the text, and most of
the modern editors have it so. The ⁸ 118111 '
is awkwardly placed. Perhaps Horace
wrote ‘si quisnam!

79. Olim] ‘ Once upon atimez' acom-
mon way of beginning a story that does not
profess to be true.

82. attentus] This 18 8 common word
for what we should 8811 ¹ close! See Epp. i.
7. 913 ii. l. 172. ‘Ut tamen' means ‘im
tamen ut! Compare S. 7. 4.

84. nec lonyae invidit avenae,] This
construction is Greek: φθονεῖν τινί τινος.
The Latin construction is with the accusa-
tive and dative, as S. i. 6. 49: “1101101·8111
J ure mihi invideat quivis ;” Epp. i. 14. 41:
“ Invidet usum Lignorum et pecoris tibil'
Lambinus introduced the reading ‘ illi '
from nearly all his MSS. Tonantius and
Cruquius have ‘illi. ' The old editions have
nearly 811ι ille‚' and Fea mentions 8 large
number of MSS. with that reading. Quin-
tilian quotes the passage as 8
with⁴i11i' (Inst. ix. 3). 1 am not cleu·
upon the subject. Bentley and the lata

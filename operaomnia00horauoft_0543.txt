SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 6. 513 .

SATIRE VI.
A.u.c. 724.

Whenevu· Horace touehes on matters personal to himself he does it with humour and
feeling. He is also very skilful in telling a story or representing a dramatic tableau.
The fable of the town and country mouse could hardly bave been better told than it is
hero. ‘rho apostrophe to the country beginning Ὀ rus, quando te aspiciam} and the
contr-ast between a town and country life, are among his most natural touchae3 and the
allusion to his intimacy with Maecenas, and the envy it had brought upon him, is
managed with delicacy towards his patron, while it shows in a very few words the mixture
of pride and annoyance which the feeling against him caused. He outlived this feeling,
mhetells usin C. iv. 3. 16 (see Introduction); but atthis time it perhaps caused him a

v gooddealofpain3 for hewasnotamanofvigorous temper-ament capableofdisregarding

a jealousy he did not daeerve, and he had none of the ambition which overleaps the
jealousyitcreatoe. He had no doeire ιο be mixed upwith public affairs3 and ifhe
aought Maecenas, it was in gratitude for his kindness and for the pleasure of his society,
and thatof the circle towhich his patr-onage introduced him. When thereforevulgar
peopleappealedto him as thedepositaryof state scaete and in the great man's con-
λ fidence, it disturbed and annoyed him probably, as he here with evident sincerity pro-
sesses.

'l'hohistorical references in this Satire mark the date of its composition pretty accu-
rately. Itappears (v. 53) thatthe Daci wereinarmsagainsttheRomans. Theyhelped
Ananim at Aetium (C. iii. 6. 14, n.), and the following γοα, Λ.υ.σ. 724, Μ. Crassus
was sent against them. (Dion Cass. li. 23.) In the same book (c. 3, sq.) Dion
rdates that the veternus who had fought at Actium, having been sent back to Italy, were
discontented and broke ont into mutiny because they had no reward. In the middle of
the winter of a.u.c. 723-724, Augustus came from Asia to Brundusium for the purpose
of quelling this mutiny, and gave money to some, and to the others he distributed land in
those disti-ias which had been favourable to Antonius. This distribution had been pro-
mised but not made when this Satire was written (v. 55). In the 'absence of Augustus,
when he went againstAntonius and till his return to Rome, Maecenas, at first singly
and aflerwards in conjunction with M. Agrippa, was deputed by Augustus to exerdse
those powers in the city and in Italy which he himself would have exerdsed bad he been
there. (DionCass.li. 33 Plinyxxxvii. 4.) Thistoois referredtoinv. 38: allofwhioh
goes ιο indicate the beginning of ΔΑΜ). 724 as the time when this Satirewas written.
Inv.40hesaysthat upwardsof sevenyears had passed since he became intimatewith
Μωσέως add to that the nine months that elapsed between his first introduction and
his recall (S. i. 6. 61), and we bring the former event to the beginning of Adi-c. 716. How
long he had been in possession of his Sabine estate we cannot gather from this Satire;
butthereisnothing in it to disturb theopinion that itwas presented to him eitherin
Ast-c. 721 or 722. He speaks familiarly of a country life no doubt, but one or two
seasons there would give him a sufficient taste of that way of living to account for any
expressions in this poem.

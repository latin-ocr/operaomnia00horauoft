HORATII FLAGOI

Insultet armentum et catulos ferae
Celent inultae stet Capitolium
Fulgens‚ triumphatisque possit
Roma ferox dare jura Medis.

Horrenda late nomen in ultimas

Extendat oras, qua medius liquor
Secernit Europen ab Afro,
Qua tumidus rigat arva Nilus,
Aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm

Cum terra celat spernere fortior

Quam cogere humanos in usus
Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.
Quicmque mundo terminus obstitit
Hunc tangat armis, visere gestiens

Qua parte debacchentur ignes,

55

Qua nebulae pluviique rores.
Sed bellicosis fata Quiritibus
Hac lege dico, ne nimium pii
Rebusque fidentes avitae

Tecta velint reparare Troiae.

Troiae renascens alite lugubri
Fortuna tristi clade iterabitur,
Ducente victrices catervas
Oonjuge me J ovis et sorore.

557), but we need not quarrel with Horace
for that. The whole plain of Troy, says
Dillenbr„ was in a sense his tomb. No
greater affront could be supposed than is
here desired. Electra represents Aegis-
thus as leaping· on her father's grave, in-
toxicated with wine (Eurip. Elect. 326, sq.:)

μέθῃ δὲ βρεχθεὶς τῆς ἐμῆς μητρὸς πόσις
ὁ κλεινὸς, ὡς λέγουσιν, ἂνθρώσκει τάφῳ.

Compare Epod. xvi. 10, sqq„ and Il. iv.

44. dare jura Media] This has been
seized upon by one class of chronologists to
prove the ode was written aster the Par-
thians had restored the standards of Crassus
and M. Antonius. But there is nothing in
the words to warrant this inference.

48. riqat arva Nilum] There is some
variety iu the punctuation of this passage
in the different editions, some putting a fuu
stop after Nilus, and ι comma at ⁴ dextra’
(v. 52). Ι have followed Orelli in reversing
this order, but it matters very little. Whe-

ther ‘ aurum irrepertum ’ &c. be taken with
the preceding stanza or the following, or
with both, the connexion is thim ⁴ let
Rome extend her arms as she will, only let
her not as her possessione inm-ense leam ω·
prize gold above virtue!

53. Quicunque mundo] Bentley presens

would trouble himself about Homoe’a ex-
pressionj, which is as intelligible ιι ‘qua-
cunque! Several MSS. have‘ mundi’ for.

‘fmuudo and most have‘ '‘for tan-
gat.' Lambinus, Cru quius, and some other
editors have ⁴ mundi q3’ but the dative is
wanted. Orelli prefers ‘ tanget' for tho
preponderance of authority. But ⁴ tang-‘i'
corresponds to ‘ extendat!

58. ne nimium pii] See Introduction.

64. Conjuye me Jovis et corona] Both
Horace and Vix-gil (Aen. i. 46) get this
combination from Homer (11. xvi. 432) ε

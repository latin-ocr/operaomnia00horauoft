Lucretius so uses ⁴ suevit' (vi. 854): “ Qui

23. Vidi eqomet niqra] The god pro-

ceeds to relate a scene that happened before
the tombs were cleared away (v. 36), in
which the characters introduced are the
notorious Canidia of whom we have seen
enough in the Epodes, and Sagana, who is
associated with her in Epod. v. 25, sqq.
Their appearance and behaviour are much
the same as there. The principal person
is Canidia, who wears a dark ‘palla,' is
without shoes, and has her hair dishevelled
(in Epod. v. 15 it is tangled with little
snakes). The moon is up and she invokes
her (Epod. v. 50), while her companion
invokes one of the furies. They arc both
deadly pale. Tbey grub up the earth with
their nails, and pour into the hole the blood

of a black lamb (black victims were sacri-

ficed to the infernal deities), which they

tear to pieces with their teeth, by which pro-
cess they hope to evoke spirits of the dead
to answer their enquiries about their lovers.
Canidia has two images, one of wool and
the other of wax, the first representing her-
self, the other her faithless lover, on whom
she is going to wreak her vengeance. We
may suppose it therefore to represent the
unhappy Varus of Epod. v. Snakes and
Hecate's hounds sui-round them, and at
the height of their incantations the moon
blushes with shame, and hides her face
behind the tombs (great barrows formed by
the burial of a number of corpses in one
pit). During their rites, in which they hide
the beard of a wolf and the tooth of a
spotted snake in the ground as a counter-
charm to thwart their adversaries, the
Manes which have been evoked converse
with them in a melancholy sharp voice3
and just when the flames which were
to melt the devoted image of wax are
at their height the ludicrous catastrophe
happens that puts them au to ssight,—
Canidia with her' Jaws chattering with fright,
and her false teeth dropping out, Sagana

with her wig flying off, and all her herba
and love· knots falling about, as they make
the best of their way gto the city.
niqra succinctam vadere palla] The
‘’palla was the upper gar-ment wom by
women out of doors as the men wore the
toga. (See S. 2. 29, n.) Here, in conse-
quence of tha expression ⁸ succinctaml
Heindorf and other commentatore, and For-
cellini, suppose ‘palla ’ to be put looaely for
the under garment, which ⁴was gathered up
and girt under the breast. But there ia no
necessity for this supposition. ‘succinctam ’
does not refer to‘ palla' at all, but merely

signifies‘ expedime asinEpod. v. 25. It ⁷

is equivalent to ‘praecinctis’ in S. 5. 6,
where see note. It occurs again S. ii. 6.
107· . “veluti succinctus cursitat hospes.

25. Cum Sagana majore] Τίιε Scholiasta
say that Sagana was the freedwoman of
one Pomponius, and that she had a younger
sister, whence she is called‘ majo r.' It
probably signifies that she was older than
Canidia, as Doering says.

27. pullam] Aeneas offers a black lmb
to Nox and Terra (Aen. vi. 249).‘

atri velleris agnam Aeneas matri Eumlemi- Δ
dum magnaeque sorori Ense ferit.” Tibullus

uses the same word as Horace (i. 2. 61);

“ Et me lustravit taedis et nocte serena ⁶
Concidit ad magicos hostia pulla deos?

28. confusus] ‘Poured and atii-rede
Compare Tibull. (i. 2. 45):

“Haec cautu finditque solum, Manesque
Eligepqlphtssido devocat ossa rogo.”

30. Lanea et cffyies erat, altera cerea .·]
The meaning of the woollen image which
was to punish the waxen oue is not very
clear. The wax was to melt, and as it melted
so was the lover to consume in the sires of
love, according to the witch’s charm in
Theocritus (ii. 28), noticed on Epod. xvii.

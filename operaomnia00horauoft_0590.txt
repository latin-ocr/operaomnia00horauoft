1. maxime Lolli,] See Introduction.

2. Dum tu declamas Romae] Horace
writes to Lollius as to one familiar with
Homer's poems. He says of himself, re-
ferring to his early education at Rome
(Epp. ii. 2. 41):

‘⁴ Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.’'

After the Romans had begun to expand the
course of their sons' education (as men-
tioned in the note on S. i. 6. 77) Homer
was one of the first authors a boy studied.
Pliny (Ep. ii. 14) has “ Sic in foro pueros a
centumviralibus causis auspicari ut ab Ho-
mero in scholis ;” and Quintilian approves
the practice: “Optime institutum est ut
ab Homero atque Virgilio lectio inciperet,
quanquam ad intelligendas eorum virtutes
firmiore judicio opus esset” (Inst. i. 8).
Boys attended the schools of the rhetorical
masters before they put on the ‘ toga virilis,’
and there they learnt to declaim upon sub-
jects given them from history, of which a
bitter description is given by Juvenal (vii.
150, sqq. ς see also x. 167):

“ Ι, demens et saevas curre per Alpes
Ut pueris placeas et declamatio fias.”

This practice was not introduced till the later
years of the republic. As late as ΛΑΜ). 662
the censors Cn. Domitius Aenobarbus and
L. Licinius Crassus issued this edict: ‘¹ Re-
nuntiatum est nobis esse homines qui novum
genus disciplinae instituerunt: ad quos ju-
ventus in ludos conveniat: eos sibi nomen
imposuisse Latinos Rhetoras: ibi homines
adolescentulos totos dies desidere. Majores
nostri quae liberos suos discere, et quos in
ludos itare vellent, instituerunt. Haec nova
quae praeter consuetudinem ao morem ma-
jorum fiunt, neque placent, neque recta
videntur. Quapropter et iis qui eos ludos
habent, et iis qui eo venire consueverunt,
videtur faciendum ut ostendamus nostram
sententiam, nobis non placere '’ (Sueton. de
Rhet. c. 1), which will serve for a good
instance of educational bigotry. The prac-
tice of declaiming with an instructor did not
cease when boys left school. They had
teachers at home. Lollius no doubt had
one. (See Introduction.)

—- Praeneste releqi ,-] Praeneste (Pales-

trina) was in Latium, about twenty-three
miles due east of Rome, on the edge of the
Apennines. It was a cool retreat, to which
Horace appears sometimes to have gone iu
summer, even when he had a place ot* his
own elsewhere. See C. iii. 4. ΞΕ, sqq.=

‘⁴ vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos, seu mihi frigidum

Praeneste sen Tibur supinum
Seu liquidae placuere Baiae-st

It suffered greatly from the cruelty of Sulla
for sheltering the younger Marius, but
afterwards recovered itself and became a
place of fashionable resort for the sake of
its climate, which Strabo notices (v. p. 365).
Juvenal calls it “gelida Praeneste ’' (iii.
190), and couples it with Tibur and other
places as a retreat from the disturbances of
Rome, and he speaks of one Centronius,
who built villas

 

modo curvo

Littore Caietae, summa nunc Tiburis arce,

Nunc Praenestinis in montibus, alta parabat

Culmina villarum, Graecis longeque petitis

Marmoribus, vincens Fortunae atque Her-
culis aedem.” (xiv. 86, sqq.)

There must therefore have been some fine
houses there, for the. temple of Fortune at
Praeneste was a handsome building3 and
Sulla, by way of making up to the in-
habitants for his barbarity, beautified this
temple very much. He placed in it the
first mosaic pavement known in Italy.
Propertius (ii. 32), remonstrating with
Cynthia says:
“Nam quid Praenestis dubias, o Cynthia,
affitssssh. Aeaei moenia Telegoni?
Curve te ιιξ Herculeum deportant esseda
Apriiikucliir toties te via ducit anum ?'’

4. Chrysippo et Crantore] As to chry-
sippus the Stoic, see S. i. 3, 126, n. Both
he and Crantor were born at the ciliciam
town Soli. Crantor studied philosophy in
the Academia under Xenocrates and with
Polemo. His writings, according to Diog.
Laert. (iv. 24), amounted εἰς μυριάδας
στιχῶν τρεῖς 30,000 lines. Cicero ranks
him among the first of the Platonists (Tusc.
Disp. iii. 6. 12), and speaks with particular

unicias-bini? (C. ii. 18. 14), asif‘ unicus’
had the foros of ἀγιιπητὸς, u that has of
‘unium' “dyavrnroc enim praeter quem
alius non datur, ut eum philosophorum prin-
oep s oculum monoculi ἀγαπητὸν dixit'’
(Heinsius, ExereitSaoejJMarc. i. 11). 1
do notagreewith Dillenbr. Plautus (captiv.
i. 2. 47) says, “Tibi enim unicust, mihi
etiamunioo magis unicus3 ”and Catullus
(73. 6)‚‘ ‘Quam modo qui me unum atque
unicum amicum habuit.”
6. jutis operata mmm] The MSS.
vary‘between εισι-ιε’ and ‘divis' The

⁷ latter is the reading followed by all the
v Scholiasts, and nearly all the editors fill

Bentley. It seems to have been that of
Cruquius’ oldest Blandinian MS. and of
Orelli' s zai-ich, and others of weight, while
the Bai-ne and many others have* sacris,’

which Bentley defends. Dillenbr. supports
the Scholiasta and reads‘ divis: thinking
that· saoeis’ is more likely to have crept
infioma g‘lossthan divis! It is hardto
say whichg' is right. 1 have followed Orelli.
For other mmploe of ‘'operor in this
sense see Foroellini. Ladies of birth
appear to have been distinguis hed on
these occasions from fieedwomen by a

gregtlnghiehp exp lains that of Tibullus

**8ιι modo easta dooe, quamvis non vitta

Imm crines nec stola longa pedesss’

'l'lie persons forming the prooession are
supposed to be thewifeandsisterofAugus-

tm, and the mother-s of the soldiers who
had returned and of their young wives, who
are represented as looking on reverentially

’ atthethanksgiving sacrifice.

9. Juvenum] This and‘ pueri 'both mean
une soldiers, as ‘virginum' and ‘’puellae
heth mean their wives. Cunningham oon-
iectures and Fea adopts ‘expertes’ for

‘expuisse’ in order to distinguish between

‘’puellae and¹ virginum! Dillenbr„ οοιιι-
pai-ingthe other ιιι which‘ pueri'
and‘ puellae' come together (C. ιιι. 1. 43

iv. 1. 25. 8. ἰ. 1. 85ς ιι.3. 130), thinksthe
words are a formula for all the youth of
Rome, and that ‘virum expertae' means
that they had experienoed the virtues of
Augustus. What he says of ‘pueri' and
‘puellae ’ will not be found true; and his
way of aoeounting for Horace having written
‘expertae' whereas the masculine would
be required for his interpretation, will not
satisfy many, neither is it very intelligible.
‘Virum expertae' is clearly equivalent to
‘nuper virgines nuptae' (C. ii. 8. 22).
‘Male ominatis’ may be pronounoed as
one word, as ‘ssmaleolens ‘vaeolens διο.
‘Nominatisss which Landinus and many
sinoe him bave adopted, is a mere eor-rec·v
tion. Bentley proposes ‘inominatisl All
the Scholiasts have ‘ominatisst and the
oldest of the Blandinian MSS. had the
same.

14. eximet] Orelli’s B has * exiget,' but
all his other MSS. have * eximet‚’ and 1 do
not find the other reading quoted by Jani
or Fea. In C. iv. 15. 18, the MSS. vary
more, though the majority and best have

‘eximet ' there likewise. Orelli makes this
distinction, that‘ exigere’ is more appro-
priate to express the violent expulsion of a
good thing, as in the above paesage3 ‘ex-
imet,' which he has here, for the quiet re·
moval of an evil: but he is almost inclined,
out of deferenoe to his MS. B, to contradict
himself, and read ‘exiget' here. ‘Eximat’
is a better wordI ihinkin thisplaoe, and

‘exiget' in the other.

— tumultum Nee mori per vini] * Tu-
multus' and‘ vis’ are well distinguished
tei-ms. When some would have sostened
the terms of the decree of the senate against
M. Antonius hy substituting the word ⁴ tu·
multum ’ for ‘belluml Cicero told them
they did not know the meaning of the
words: “ Potest enim esse bellum sine
tumultu, tumultus esse sine bello ιιοιι po-
test. Quid ost enim tumultus nisi pertur-
batio tanta ut major timor oriatur-.> unde
etiam nomen ductum est tumultus. Itaque
majores nostri tumultum Italicum, quod.

means of deciding the question. Those who
wish to know all that has been said on either
side can read an Excursus of Obbarius on
v. 12 of the next Epistle. As to ‘imbelle
Tarentum,’ see ,8. 11. 4. 34, 11.

46. Philippus] This was L. Marcius
Philippus, who was tribunus plebis A.u.c.
650, consul A.u.c. 663. and censor A.u.c.
668. He was a very distinguished man, an
energetic supporter of the popular cause,
a friend of Cn. Pompeius and a powerfui
orator. Cicero describes him as “ hominem
imprimis disertum atque eruditum, qui ita
solet ad dicendum surgere, ut quod primum
verbum habiturus sit nesciat: et ait idem
quum brachium concalefecerit tum se solere
pugnare '' (De Orat. ii. 78. See also iii. l
for his vigorous language towards the se-
nate): “ Duobus igitur summis Crasso et
Antonio L. Philippus proxime accedebat,
sed longo intervallo tamen proximus ’'
(Brut. 47). Cicero therefore did not rank
him among the first oratore, but he goes on
to say that if he were put out of comparison
with the highest there was much to admire
in him t his speech was free, his wit abun-
dant3 he was inventive, and perspicuous,
and elever in repartee; and elsewhere 110
calls him “suavis orator, gravis, facetus'’
(Brut. 50 .

47. ociavam circiter horam] The fol-
lowing is Martial’s description of the distri-
bution of a Roman’s day 2-The first and
second hours were given to the ‘ salutatioss
or reception of cliente and visitors. At the
third hour the courts opened and business
went on for three hours. Τ110 sixth hour
was given up to rest (and the ⁴ prandium ’),
the seventh to winding up business, the
eighth to exercise, and with the ninth began
dinner. (Mart. iv. 8.) In the main this
appears to have been the division of the
day in Horace's time likewise.

48. Foro nimium distare Carinae] The
Carinae was a collection of buildings on the
north side of the Via Sacra, under Mons
Esquilinus, occupying part of the fourth
and third quarters of the city, though the

greater part of it was in the fourth, corre-
sponding, Nardiui supposes, with that part
which is now called Pantani3 but that part
of the Carinae which was in the third
quai-ter comprised the spot on which aster·
wards was built the Colosseum. and which
was distinguished by the name of 001111101ιεί3.
The Carinae comprised the houses of many
ptem-§ms gf distitiztiolp, amp‘ng whom we read
o assius w ose uso was

downp after he had been put to death, Cn.
Pompeius (afterwards occupied by Μ. An-
tonius), of Tiberius (Suet. vit. Tib. 15), of
M. Manilius (Cic. Parad. 0. ai, of Balbinus,
and of this Philippus. The temples of Con- ,

cordia and Tellus were in the same part. ,

The farthest part of the Carinae could not
have been above three-quartem of a mih
from the Forum Romanum; but Philippus
was old. Horace means to show that he
was inclined to be peevish, being tired with
his work in the Forum3 andin this splenefic
humour, which, if this storybe m,· had

become habitual with him, he feu m with ’

the man Mena, whose easy enioyment of
life made 0 strong impression upon him. It
made him jealous, and he resolved to spoil
his independence if he could. -

50. Adrasum quendam] TheMSS. and
editions vary between‘ adrasum' and ‘ahra-
sum,' and each reading has warm defendere.
The former has most authority, and diffen
least from ‘rasum,'·which is all Horace
means. He had just been shaved and was
pai-ing aud cleaning his nails leisurely for
himself(⁴ proprios pgurgantem ungues '), he
did not employ the barber for this opera-
tion, as people were in the habit of doing.
The shop was empty, because those who
would come for business came bai-ly, and
those who came to lounge came later (S. i.
7. 3). ‘ Umbra,' which here means a shop,
is used for different kinds of buildings by

the poets, as a ‘porticusAdand a school.

See Juverial (vii. 173)-
rhetorica descendit ab umbra! (See For-
cellini. ) The shops were open probably 33

they are in Italy now.

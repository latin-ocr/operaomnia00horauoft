62 HORATII FLAOGI

GARMEN XXVIII.

A great deal has been written about this ode, as to the spirit and purport of it, the occa-
sion of its composition, the persons introduced, and the parts they respectively bear.
The more literally we take the ode and the less we search for hidden meanings, or attempt
to fix the date or the causes that led to the train of thought, the more likely we are, Ι
conceive, to arrive at the true bearing of the ode. Septimius, one of Horace’s most
intimate friends, had a villa at Tarentum (C. ii. 6), where it is likely Horace on some
occasion, if not often, paid him a visit. It seems to me not improbable that he may have
seen a body cast on shore at that place where the scene appears to be laid. The sight of
this body might naturally suggest such an ode as this, in which the spirit of a shipwrecked
man is introduced moralizing upon death and asking for burial. His reflectione take the
form, in the first instance, of an address to Archytas the philosopher, whose name was
associated with the place ; and 118 joins with him other worthies, whose wisdom and
greatness had not saved them from the common lot of all. There would appear to have
been a legend that Archytas was buried on the shore under the promontory of Matinum,

running out from the range of Mons Garganus in Apulia. Possibly a tomb was shown >
there that was said to be his. But it does not follow that the speaker was there. The ‘3

name of Archytas would be suggested by his association with Tarentum, where Ι think
(from v. 29) the scene is laid, and the name of such a man is naturally connected with
the reflectione of this ode, even independently of his connexion with the place. That
Archytas was shipwrecked on a voyage down the Adriatic (which is the general opinion)
has been too hastily assumed from this ode. If he was really buried at the foot of Mons
Garganus, there are other ways of accounting for it. But the fact itself is not beyond
question. “

sse ode has much the appearance at first sight of a dialogus, md the great majority of

commentators take it in that way. Though differing from others as to the division of the ·
dialogue, which I thought should take place in the middle of the fisteenth verse, Ι was ³

once of the same opinion myself. I have now changed that opinion, and believe,
with Hottinger and others, quoted by Orelli in his Excursus, that itis no dialogue
at all, which view I am the more disposed to adopt, because it is supported by the
judgment of my friend Mr. Long. Those who hold this opinion are, neverthehss‚
divided in their interpretation. Casaubon affirmed that the ode was merely the poet's
meditation upon the fate of Archytas and on the destiny of all great men: followed by
an appeal, on the part of Archytas, for burial (Ι suppose at v. 21). Liibkm* and Ruel
think Horace's ghost is speaking under the fanciful notion that he himself had hoen
drowned off Palinurus (C. iii. 4. 27). G. Fabricius supposed the shade of Archytas to be
speaking throughout. Hottinger (Opusc. Phil. Lips. 1817) and Weiske (Jahn. Annal-
Phil. 1830) held the view that I have adopted, with the exception that they suppoaed the
unfortunate man, whose body is lying unburied, is speaking at the tomb of Archytas on
the promontory of Matinum. Ι see no occasion for that, and think the subject of the
ode is more likely to have been suggested at Tarentum than any where else. The words
⁴ Neptuno custode Tarenti ' seem to fix the scene. If Archytas was buried, or supposed
to be buried, at Matinum, it would be natural for one who thought of the narrow space
to which his greatness was reduced to mention the spot where his bones lay. But it does

not appear why a person speaking at Matinum should talk of Neptune particularly ss the ,

‘ custos Tarenti!

Those who consider that the whole ode consists of a dialogus between a sailor and
Archytas divide it either after v. 6, or v. 16, or v. 20. They who make the marim
cease to speak at v. 6, do so chiefly, because the subjects that follow that verse are sup-
posed to be above a speaker of his class. But, as that would be contradicted by Archytas’

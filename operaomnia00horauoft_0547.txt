19. Libitinae acerbae] The
goddeoe nbitina was one of the oldest
Roman divinitiee. Plutarch (Quneet. Rom.
23) speaks of her service being es old ns
Num, who identified her with Venus, in
order to bring together the beginning md
the end of human life, and he mentions nn

’ ’Δφροδίτη Ἐπιι-υμβέα nt Delphi. She was

also identified with Persephone. She pre-
sided over funereis and all things pertnining
to fliedend. There were kept in her temple
(the site of which is not known) au manner
of things required nt fanonis, where the
undertakers (hence called Libitina-ii) might

of “ pesilenth unius Auctumni qus triginta

runt? one sickly autumn in which thirty
thounnd suna-ab were entered in the
nements of Libitina and in Eusebius’
Chron. mention is made of an epidemic in
thetime of V ' z ‘⁴ lues ingens Romae
sucta in ut per multos dies in ephemeridem
decem millia ferme mortuorum hominum
referantur;” where the ephemeris seems
to be the register in this temple. From
both the above souroes the temple would
derive ineremsed revenuae in ιι seeson of
great mortality. Horace twice use· the
name of Libitina as equivalent to Mors.

See C. iii. 30. 6: “ magnaque pars mei
vitabit Libitinam ;’' und Epp. ii. 1. 49: ‘⁴ mi-

ratusque nihil nisi quod Libitina mavit ;''
and Juvenal does the same (S. iv. 122):
“nam si Libitinam evaserit aeger Delebit
tabulas?

r 29. Matutine palem] Jenus was pecu·

lim-ly a latin divinity, and oneof the oldest.

As he proeided over the opening year, so he
did also over the beginning of every month
und of every day. Soerifices were offered
‚to him οιι the first of every month, as well
ts of hisown own(Jannary)‚ and prayer in the
morning of every day. Hence heis called

us pater? and hence he is con-

founded with the Suu. ‘'Pater was the
title by which he was commonly addressed,
md ncmrding to Gellius (v. 12) the two

wordswere joined thus, ‘UlmuspUer’ See

Epp. i. 16. 59,ι ‘putesne ,clare clare cum

dixit, ΑροΙΙο.Π He was worshipped before

the other gods, which Ovid makes him

HORATII FLAOGI

Iratis exstructa dedit risusque jocosque,
Dum flamma sine thura liquescere limine sacro

Persuadere cupit.

Credat J udaeus Apella,

100

Non ego: namque deos didici securum agere aem,
Nec si quid miri faciat natura deos id

Tristes ex alto caeli demittere tecto,

Brundusium longae finis chartaeque viaeque est.

near Torre d’Agnazzo, six miles from the
town of Monopoli. “ Little remains (says
Swinburne) except part of the ramparts,
which, near the sea, are entire as high up as
the bottom of the battlements. Sixteen
com-ses of large stones are still complete,
and the thickness of this bulwark is exactly
eight yards, an extraordinary breadth,
which Ι ascertained by repeated measure·
ments. The town seems to have been
square, and its principal streets drawn in
straight lines.” Horace says it was built
under the displeasure of the Nymphs, be-
cause the water was so bad. “Want of
water caused the destruction of Gnatia,—a
scarcity Ι had an opportunity of being made
sensible of. I was obliged to content myself
with the water of a cistern full of tadpoles,
and qualify it with a large quantity of wine
that resembled treacle much more than the
juice of the grape. While I held the pitcher
to my lips, Ι formed a dam with a knife to
prevent the little frogs from slipping down
my throat. Till that day I had had but an
imperfect idea of thirst’' (Swinburne, i. 203).
The miracle Horace mentions appears to
have been a cheat of long continuance, for
Pliny mentions it likewise (N. H. ii. lll):
“ In Salentino oppido Egnatia, imposito
ligno in saxum quoddam ibi sacrum, proti-
nus flammam existere.” Liquefactions are
a sort of miracle that have not yet lost their
chax-m for the ignorant, or their profit for
the designing. ‘Lymphae’ and ¹ Nymphae'
are essentially the same word, but I am not
aware of any other place in which the
Nymphs are called Lymphae.

100. Judaeus Apella,] The majority of
the Jews at Rome were freedmen, which
probably affords the best explanation of the
synagogue of the Libertines at Jerusalem
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles
(vi. 9). Apella was a common name for
‘ libertini! Their creed was a superstition of
the most contemptible kind in the eyes of a
Roman ; and a J ew was only another name
for a credulous fool. The Jews returned

their contempt with hatred, which showed
itself in a turbulent spirit that made them
very troublesome. Horace intimatas that
he had learnt from the school of Epicurus
that the gods were too happy to mind the
small affairs of this world, which he ex-
presses in the words of Luc-etius (vi. 573:
‘⁴ Nam bene qui didicere deos securumagere
aevum.'' See C. i. 34. 2, n.‚and the Intro-
duction to that ode.

104. Brundusium] From this abrupt
conclusion we may judge that Horace had
got tired of his journal as well as his jour-
ney. Brundusium (Brindisi) was for cen-
turies the most important town on the
eastern coast of Italy, chiefly through the
convenience of its position for communi-
cating with Greece, and the excellence of its
harbour. The port is double. The outer
port is formed by two promontories that
stretch off gradually from each other as
they advance into the sea, leaving a very
narrow channel at the base of the angle,
which leads into the inner port. This
stretclies to the right and lest, and between
the two arms or branches lay the city. In
the old Messapian tongue Brundusium is said
to have meant a decr, the name being de·
rived from the appearance of a stag’s head
formed by this inner port. “The whole
kingdom of Naples mnnot show a more
complete situation for trade than Brindisi.
Here goodness of soil, safety of anchorage,
and a centra] position are all united'' (Swinb.
i. 386). Little remains of ancient Brun-
dusium but broken pillars, fragments οἲ
common Mosaic‚ with a few inscriptions
and coins. Its distance from Egnatia was
thirty-five miles according to the Jerusalem
Itinerary and the Tabula Theodosiana, and
thirty-nine according to the Itinerary of
Antoninus. There was a station named
Speluncae (now Grotta Rosa) midway,
where the party may have halted one night,
and which Horace, having nothing he cared
to tell usabout it, has passed over in silence.

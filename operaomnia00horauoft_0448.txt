3. Accurrit] Some of the old editions
have ‘ occurrit! I am not aware that it
appears in any modern edition. It is much
less forcible.

5. Suaviter ut nunc πῂ] ‘ Pretty well
as times go ;' by which, as Orelli says, he
means nothing at all, not cai-ing what he
answers, but annoyed at the forwardness of
his assailant. ‘ Cupio omnia quae vis ’ is a
common formula of politeness.

6. Cum assectaretur :] There is a
pause, and they walk side by side a little
way perhaps, in silence. Horace sees the
man means to begin, and anticipates him
(‘ occupat ’) with a civil question tanta-
mount to wishing him good morning, by
which however the other is not discon-
certed. “ Surely you know me: I’m a
man of letters;’' at which Horace, who is
too good-natured to bc a match for such a
fellow, is thrown off his guard and returns
him a polite answer. The man has gained
his advantage and goes on chattering about
nothing; while Horace feels his weakness
and is driven to common-place expediente
for effecting his escape, at which his com-
panion no doubt laughs in his sleeve.
⁴ Numquid vis quin abeam ?' ¹ is there any-
thing else 1 can do for you before I go ?'’
Prof. Key (L. G. 1183) quotes this phrase
from Terence (Ad. ii. 2. 39), and adds in a
note, “This or a shorter form, ‘ numquid
vis ?' was a civil mode of saying good-bye.'’

10. Dicere nescio quid puero‚] When
the Romans walked abroad even for a stroll
on the most ordinary occasions, they had
one 01· more slaves with them. They were
a particular class in the ⁴familia,' and called
from their occupatiori ¹ pedisequi.'

11. Ο te, Bolane, cerebri Felicem Ι]
Τ110 meaning of ‘cerebri' is seen in the
adjective ⁶ cerebrosus’ noticed above (5.
21); and guided by the words of Horace,
no doubt, Comm. Cruq. tells us that Bo-
lanus was ὀξύχολος, one who, ‘nullius in-

eptias ferebat: put up with no man's non· ’

sense,—a temper which, under such circum-
stances, the amiable Horace might very well
envy. But he was too well-bred to say
what he felt aloud. Bolanus was a cog
nomen of one at least of the families at
Rome. Vettius Bolanus was appointed
governor of Britain 10 the last year of
Nero’s reign (Tac. Ann. xv. 3), and Cicero
had a friend of the same name. It was
derived from Bola, a town of the Aequi.
Francis' translation,—

“ Bolanus happy in a skull
Of proof, impenetrably du11‚”

seems'to me quite beside the meaning.

14. Misere cupis, inquit, abire ‚·] Here
the man, feeling his power, puts on all the
familiarity of an intimate friend, aud insitis
upon offering his services and attendance,
and this is better expressed by ¹ persequax-¹
than ‘ prosequar,’ which however has very ν ,
good MS. authority, and Bentley adopts it.
The majority of MSS. appear by Fea’e
account to have ‘persequar,' which means
⁴ I will follow you to the end.¹ In r
to the arrangement, the editions vary be-
tween ⁴ persequar hinc: quo nunc iter eat
tibi ?’ ⁴ persequar: hinc quo nunc iter est
tibi ?' and ⁴ persequar hinc quo nunc iter
est tibi,' without a question. It appears to
me that the man asks a question, and that
Horace’s reply is an evasion of it.

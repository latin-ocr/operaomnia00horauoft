‘Patas' is more in Horace’s way than

‘lputes which Bentley thinks· ‘mollins et
verecundius? and adop ts from some MSS„
among others the Bhndiqan. These also
have‘ ut' instead οἱ* et, and the MSS.
and editions are much divided.1 do not
think there is much to choose between
them. ‘ Lucus ’ is usually a grove dedicated
to some divinity, and Horace means perhaps
that the man had no regard for what others
held· med, but connted a consecrated
grove no better than any other wood. So
Orelli at least takes it. Ι do not feel sure
that such is Horace’s meaning. ⁴ Lucus’
was sometimes used indifferently for any
wood, as Forcellini shows, and Horace may
mean ‘if you think virtue consiste only of
words as a grove does of ΜΚ ἰιι which
case ‘ut’ would be better than ⁴ et,' though
¹ et ¹ would do.

32. caveae portus occupet alten] As
to‘ occupo ’seeC...,.iil228n Horace
says‘ ‘if you think lightly of virtue as the
means of happiness, be active and make
money. see no one gets into hai-bour before

you to carry off the business before you
arrive. ’¹ He supposes him a ‘neg‹›‹='ator‚¹
which class of perso

banking and money· -lending, but they also
engaged in mercantile uansacfions, the
difference between them and‘ mercatores'
being that the latter travelled with their
own πω, while the‘ res' did
business in a general way. Cibyra Major
(Horzoom) was sitnated on a branch (now
mlled Horzoom Ich y) of the Indus, on the
north- west box-ders of Lycia (Spratt's Lycia,
voLLp.256).1t was y‘called major’ to
distingo ish it from a smallartownon the
coast of Pamphylia. Twenty -five towns
belonged to the conventus of Cibyra, and its
commercial transactions were probably large.
As to the limits of Bithynia after it became
a Roman province, see Dict. Geog. It
included a great part of Pontus, and so
comprised nearly the whole sea-coast of
Asia Minor on the Euxine. Its trade
therefore must have been very great, since
the Halys alone must have brought down
vast quantities of merchandize, and there
were other navigable rivers, as the Lycus,
Iris, Parthenius, Sangarius, communioeting
with the interior. It had also convenient
harbours on the Propontis, and was only
separated from Europe by the narrow
Thracian Bosporus. Its mountains pro-
duced valuable minerals and precious stones
and marblae of different kinds. The names
Thyni and Bithyni originally represented
two different peoples of Thracewho migrated
intothispartofAsiaand displacedthe
native tribes. ssey remained distinct for
some time, but at this time the distinction
was not observed3 therefore Horace speaks
of‘Thyna merx' (C. iii. 7. 3), where ha
means generally Bithynian. ⁸ Negotia' is
commonly used for the business transactione
of a ‘n torss as Cicero, in his letter
introducing Manlius Sosis to Acilius, pro·
consul of Sicily (ad Fam. xiii. 20), says,

“egohabetn tiayvetera inSiciliasua.'¹ He
had debisego to get in, and amun& of old
standing to settle.

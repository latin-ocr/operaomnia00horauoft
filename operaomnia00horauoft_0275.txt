CARMEN XI.

There will be found in this and in the only other two Sapphic odes contained in this
book more deviations, in the proportion of nearly four to one, from the caesursl arrange-
ment observed in the three first books, than in all the odes of those books put together.
From this and other internal evidence it has been argued that this ode is a late one, but Ι
think the arguments are inconclusive. It is true that Horace adds-esses Phyllis as his last
love, but not, so far as I can see, ιιι the tone of a person now grown old, as Buttmann
says. Most men wishing to please a woman vow constuncy to her, and one who was
obliged to confess that he had been inconstant to others would only be the more vehe-
ment in professing stedtnstnaes to her whom he desired for the occasion ιο win. But Ῑ
do not mean to express any decided opinion one way or the other. It is only important
to bear in mind thatthis book was published, not to revive Horace’s reputetion as a writer
of amatory verses, but st the desire of the emperor, who wished the praises of his stepsons
ιο be sent forth to the world, and his own with them. The ode to Lyde, on the dsy of
the Neptunalia (C. ιιι. 28), is like this and has more spirit. It is not impossible Horaoe
may have written this as early as the other, bnt thought the othei· better, and that one cf
the kind was enough for publication. The form ⁴ spargier: which occurs no where else
in the odes, gives this the appearance of a different style of composition from others ς but
whether this is due to demgn or carelessness, or to its being sn early or late productim,
cannot be determined. It is not at all uulikely, as some commentator has supposed, that
the ode was sent to Maecenas on his birthday, and was only thrown into the form οι· an
address to Phyllis for poeticsl convenience.

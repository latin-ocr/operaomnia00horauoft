284 HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN V.

There is so much likeness between this singular ode and part of the eighth Satire of the
first book, that it is generally supposed they were written about the same time, or about
A.15.c. 721. A scene is represented in which the unfortunate woman Canidia (Ep. 3. 8,
n.), so unmercifully satirized by Horace for a succession of years, is the chief acu-ess. She
is passionately in love with one Varus, whom she calls an old sinner but whose heart she
is resolved to win. To this end she resorts to magical philters, for the composition of
which, in company with three other witches, she gete a boy of good family, strips him
naked and buries him up to his chin in a hole, in order that there with sood put before
him he might wither away in the midst of longing, and so his liver might form, in eon-
junction with other ingredients, a love-potion to be administered to the faithless Varus.
What could have put such a scene into Horace’s head it is hard to say3 but in treating it
as one that actually happened, and that at Naples (from v. 43), Porphyrion and those who
have followed him show more simplicity than judgment. That the scene does not even
profess to be laid at Naples is clear from the dogs of the Suburra (58) and tho vultures
of the Esquiline hill (100) being introduced.

ARGUMENT.

“Tell me, by the gods, by thy children, if Lucina hath ever blessed thee, by this purple
toga which should protect my childhood, tell me what meaneth this hon-id scene. Why
look ye at me so sternly ?'' As these words drop from the trembling and naked child,
Canidia bids them bring branches from the tombs, a screech-owl’s wing and eggs steeped
in frog’s blood, poisonous herbs of Thessaly and Hiberia, and bones snatched from the
jaws of a hungry biteh, to burn in the magio flames. Sagana meanwhile sprinkles waters
of Avernus over the chamber, and Veia digs'a pit where the boy must stand buried to
the chin that his marrow and liver may dry up and become fit ingrediente foi· the potion.
Folia too is there charming stars and moon from the sky. Tben Canidia bursts forth,
saying, ‘⁴ Night and Diana avenge me on my enemies. Give me such an ointment to
smear the old man with that the dogs may bark at him as he goes to his vile hanutu-
But what is this ? How did Medea succeed while 1 fail? Ι know every herb. Ι have
anointed his bed. I see, 1 see. Some charm more skilled has set him free. No oom-
mon potion therefore, no hacknied spell will Ι prepare for thee, Varus: the skies shall
sink below the sea if thou burn not with love for me.'¹ Then the boy breaks out into
cursing, and says, “ The destiny of man is unchangeable. 1 will curse you, and my
curse no sacrifice shall avert. My ghost shall haunt you by night, and tear your flesh, ,
and rob you of sleep. Men shall stone you, and wolves and vultures shall war-yom-
unburied oeroeses, and my parents shall live to see it.”

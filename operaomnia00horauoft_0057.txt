CARMEN VIII.

The principle of identification has led to strange confusion and inventione respecting
the name „eumad in this ode. 1 find from Estre that one scholar has affin-med, that by
Lydia* Horace meant Julia and by Sybaris Marcellus. ΤΙιε reader has only to compare

’ , the odes in which this name occurs and he will form his own opinion. Here there is no

sign of jealousy, but anxiety for the reputation of Sybarim iu C. i. 13 there is violent
jealousy of Telephum in iii. 9 there is a lover's eoquetfing and reconciliation3 while
in i. 25 Lydia is a worn-out prostitute looking for lovers who will not come. If we had
more of Anacreou’s poen-y to guide us, we should probably see such traces of the origin
of au these odes aa would put the matter in its right light. The name of· Sybaris is
obviously intended to represent the character into which the youth has fallen.

ARGUMENT.

Lydia, why art thou spoiling Sybaris thus, eo that he shnns all manly exerciaee? He
who was once so active, why does he no longer ride, and swim, and wraetle, and
throw the quoit and javelin in the campus Martius? Why does he hide himself with

, thoe, like Achillea, in woman’s apparel?

LYmA, die, per omnes

Te deos oro, Sybarin eur properas amando
Perdere; cur apricum

Oderit eampum patiens pulveris atque solis?
Gur neque militaris 5

Inter aequales equitat, Gallica nee lupatis
Temperat ora frenis?

Gur timet flavum Tiberim tangere? Gur olivum
Sanguine viperino

Cautius vitat, neque jam livida gestat armis 10
Brachia saepe diseo,

Saepe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito?
Quid latet, ut marinae

Filium dieunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Trojae
Funera ne virilis 15

Cultus in eaedem et Lycias proriperet catervas?

2. properas] The reading of the MSS. including Bentley, nearly all have ‘pro-
ie ‘ properes 3’ but the Scholiasta had ‘ pro- pere5‚’ and some good MSS. have ⁴ equitet‚'
pei-ael and Bentley has said, I think truly, ⁸ temperet,' which are adopted by Lambi-
that the other reading probably arose out nus, cruquius‚ and others. They were
of ‘ oderit! But that word has an indica- stopped by ‘ timet‚’ or they would probably
tive sense, and 1 think the direct form is have changed ‘vitat' and ‘ gestat· into the
better throughout. The modern editors, subjunctive.

328 HORATII FLAOGI

Perfidus hic caupo, miles, nautaeque per omne

Audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem 3ο ’
Sese ferre, senes ut in otia tuta recedant,

Aiunt, quum sibi sint congesta cibaria : sicut

Parvula, nam exemplo est, magni formica laboris

Ore trahit quodcunque potest atque addit acervo, Ι
Quem struit haud ignara ac non incauta futuri. 35
Quae, simul inversum contristat Aquarius annum,

Non usquam prorepit et illis utitur ante

Quaesitis sapiens 3 quum te neque fervidus aestus
Demoveat lucro, neque hiems, ignis, mare, ferrum, v
Nil obstet tibi dum ne sit te ditior alter. 1ο
Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus et auri

Horace does not mean that to be the only
solution of the universal discontent. That
would be absurd, and one at least of his
own examples would contradict his theory,
the jurisconsultus, who did not pursue his
laborious vocation for pay. He therefore
shifts or limits his ground a little, and
dwells upon that which he supposes to be
the most prevalent cause of discontent3
and wit-h his ground he changes his ex-
amples. There is no reason, therefore, to
suspect the reading ‘perfidus hic caupo,'
which has caused the critice a vast deal of
trouble ever since Markland first suggested
that it was wrong. Before that, the com-
mentators were all satisfied to take Horace
as they found him. Orelli has given nine
different conjectural readings, not one of
which seems w me to have any merit. Fea
has found in a few MSS. the word ‘ campo '
for ‘ caupo,' but that is not surprising.
There are no other variations in the MSS.
or Scholiasts, and this gives 110 581158 at all.
‘Nauta ’ and ‘ mercator ' here are the same
person, the trader navigating his own ship.
(See C. i. 28. 23, and Intr.). ‘Perfidus
caupo ' appears again in ‘ cauponibus atque
malignis ' (S. i. 5. 4). ‘ Per omne Audaces
mare qui currunt ' is repeated from C. i. 3.
9, sqq.

32. cibaria :] This word, which is gene-
rally used for the rations of soldiers or slaves,
is used here ironically for the humblest
provision that can be made sor the latter
years of life, as if that was all that ‘these
men set before their minds.

35. haud iqnara ac non incauta futuri]
Experience tells her that times will change,
and instinct teaches her to provide against
that change; she knows what is coming,
and provides accordingly. This is what

Horace means; bnt the ant is torpid in the
winter, and lays up no store in her house for
that season, though no error is more eom·
mon than to suppose she does. These
animals work hard during thewarmer months
of the year, but the food they gather is con-
sumed before the winter. ‘Quae’ is op·
posed to ‘ quum te :¹ ‘ now she.' ‘ Inversum
annum ’ is compounded of the two notions
‘inversum eaelum ' and ⁴ mutatum annum!
Τ118 51111 enters Aquarius in the middle of
J anuary. Virgil uses the word ‘ confi-istat ’
(Georg. iii. 279): ‘¹ unde nigerrimus Auster
Nascitur, et pluvio contristat frigore cae-
lum.” The MSS. are divided between
⁴ sapiens ’ and ⁴ patiens! The Scholiasta
too are divided. Acron had ‘patiens' and
interpreted it ‘ contenta,’ while Porphyriou'a
reading, and that of Cruquius' commentator,
was ‘sapiensl The editions before Inam-
binus I believe, with soercely any excep-
tions, have ‘ patiens! He restored ⁴ 5ομ
piens,’ which Cruquius found in all his
MSS„ and I have no doubt it is the right
word. It suits the coutext‚and coi-responde
to what Horace says elsewhere (C. iv. 9.

‘⁴ Nec possidentem multa vocaveris ·
Recte beatum ; rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti-mlleffl

The question at issue is not one of patience,
but of prudence in the pursuit and the use
of wealth, both of which, according to the
vulgar error, the ant is famous for. She is
one of the “ four things which are little
11133111ἓὲ, 232 ..mffoes
and the spiders. (Prov. xxx. 24, sqq.).

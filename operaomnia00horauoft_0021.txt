It is evident that Maecenas valued 1115 society and understood his

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons of consideration whose friendship he appears to have
enjoyed. Through Maecenas also it 15 probable Horace was introduced
to Augustus, but when that happened is uncertain. In Amne. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi·
sium, and he took Horace with him 011 11151 journey, of which a detailed
account is given in the fifth Satire of the first book. Horace appears
to have parted from the rest of the company at Brundisium, and per-
haps returned to che by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Int.).

the Sabine country. Of this property he gives a description 1111115 Epistle

and to have been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being

⁷ four miles from the nearest town, Varia (V ico Varo), a municipium per-

. hapa, but not a place of any importance. During this interval he con-

tinued to write Satires and Epodes, but also, it appears to me probable,
some of the Odes, which some years later he published, and others which
he did not publish. These compositions I have no doubgwere seen by

'Frauke’s arguments are not conclusive. In A.U.e. 723 the battle of

on that occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first

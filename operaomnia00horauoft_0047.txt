CARMEN IV.

Lucius Sestius servet! with Horace under Brutus, and they were no doubt on terms of
intimacy (see Dict. Biog. Sestius 6). But this ode has probably as little to do with
L. Sestius as with any of Horace’s other friends. Τὴε poet borrowed his name to give
point to an ode written st the beginning of spring and moralihing on the uncertainty of
life and the duty of enjoying it. The same remark, with a change in the names, will
apply to C. iv. ’1. Traces of imitation from the Greek are observed by some commen·
tators, and some Sicilian poem containing references to Mount Aetna is fixed upon as the
source of this ode. Also it has been conjectured, that it may have been written at
Baiae or Velia in sight of the Liparaean volcanic islands, which may or may not have been
the case. We do not want both explanations it is plain3 perhaps neither. Beyond the
word ⁴ urit,' which seems to be a translation of φλέγει, Ι am not aware that there are as
many traoes of the Greek as might be found in most of Horace's odes.

'l'he time must be quite the commencement of the spring. The whole description, in
which the present tense is used throughout, indicates the beginning of those things that
are desa-ibes} ; and though Ovid, referring to the month of April (Fast. iv. 129), speaks

’ of the launching of the ships,—

“ Vere monet curvas materna per aequora puppes
Ire, nec hybernas jam timuisse nives,''—
Horace’s words clearly refer to an earlier mouth. Rutgersius contends very strongly
that April is the mouth to which the descriptions of this od belong, especially vv. ll, 12,
which, he says, refer to the Palilia, the festival of Rome’s irthday‚ which was the 2lst
April. But that is much too late. See note on v. ll. Rutgersius contradicts himself
by saying that the allusion in v. 9 refers to the practice of Roman mati-ons bathing with
their heads crowned with myrtle, which took place on the calends of April. Ov. Fast. iv.

edition of Cic. in Verrem. Tetrarchs were
properly governors of 3 fourth part of a
province or other territorial division; but
the title was not so limited in practice. It
was 3 title originally confined,to the petty
princes of Asia Minor3 the Romans gave it
to different members of Herod's family who
succeeded to the syrim part of his do-
minicus. Describing the troops assembled

at Pharsalia, Lucan says (vii. 226):

‘⁴ Sicci sed plurima campi
‚ Tcflarclne regesque tenent magnique ty-
Ἢ {imnis Latio quae servit purpura

and Cic. (proMil. 28. 76): ‘⁴ Omitto socios,
extens nationes, reges, tetrarchas.”

³ 13. mensa tripes] This was the simplest
and most old-fashioned shape, and the
tables were small, only suited to a person
dining by himself or with one or two com-
panions. The wealthy Romans were very
utravagant about their tabloe. See 8. ii.
2. 4, n. The salt-cellar was usually, except
&¹:23⁶ {2⁰53ssssssAEss mem}
table, and had 3ι sacred character. See
C. ii. 16. 14: “paternum Splendet in
mensa tenni salinuml' Porphyrion says the
poor eat their salt outofa sea-shell. ‘Puri'

onlymeans‘ clean.¹ TheScholiasts’ expla-
nation ‘non conditi: ‘sine condimentis)

13 not intelligible to me.

15. Decies centena] ‘Ten millions of
mm: —a common way of expressing
the largest number. On the construction,

an nncommon way. ἦν ἄν would be the
Greek equivalent.1t is a loose conversa-

tionalway ofspeaking.

20. Immo alia] Orelli says ‘immo’

here expresses wonder at a man asking a
question on a matter where there is no
doubt. 1 do not see how that meaning can
be got from it. Professor Key has given
the precise interpretation of it here (L. G.
l429): ‘¹ ⁴ Immo' seems to have signified
properly an assent with an important quali-
fication.” This explanation is borne out
by the etymology of the word, which is
compounded of ‘in’ and ‘modo.' (The
subject is fully discussed in Mr. Long’s
note on Cic. Verr. ii. 1. 1). Τ113 qualifica-
tion 13 found in ⁶ et fortasse minora,' which
some editors have corrupted into ‘haud
fortasse miuora,’ destroying the sense and
turning it into cant. A man does not
qualify himself for a censor by proclaiming
that his own saults are asbad as those he 13
blaming. ‘At' for ‘et' is nnauthorised
and unneoessary. Τ113 qualification it con-
veys is contained in ‘immo.’ The correc-
tion is Baxter's, and arose out of > the
Scholiasts' paraphrase (Comm. Cruq.):
“confiteor me habere vitia sed fortasse
minora.” Horace means to say he admits
he has his fausta, and is not 30 selfish and
foolish as Maenius (333 8. 1. 101 of this
book), who reviled the man Novius behind
his back, and, when told to look at his own
faults, said 113 made excuses for himself
which he would not make for others. No·
vius may be anybody: we know nothing
about him. Whether he has any connex-
ion with the Novius mentioned 111 the
sixth Satire of this book, v. 40, the plebeian
tribune, or the usurer in v. 121 of the same
Satire, it is impossible to say. ⁸ Dareverba’
means to give words in the place of facts,
to deceive.

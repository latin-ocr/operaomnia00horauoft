HORATII FLAOGI

ARGUMENT.

Weep not, Asterie3 Gyges is faithful and will return with the spring a rich man. He
has been driven to Oricum and is weeping with impatience for thee. Chloe his

hostess is trying to seduce him, and frightens him with stories of rejected women’s
revenge. But he is deas to her seductions. Beware in thy turn of Enipeus thy
gallant neighbour. shut thy doors and listen not to his songs.

QUID fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
Primo restituent vere Favonii

Thyna merce beatum,

Constantis juvenem fide, ,
Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum 5
Post insana Caprae sidera frigidas

Noctes 11011 sine multis

Insomnis lacrimis agit.
Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,

Suspirare Chloen et miseram tuis

Dicens ignibus uri,

Tentat mille vafer modis.
Ut Proetum mulier perfida credulum
Falsis impulerit criminibus nimis

2. Favonii] See C. i. 4. 1. Favonius,
according to Pliny (ii. 47), blew 4 ab occasu
aequinocfiali,' that is, due west. It 'would
therefore be a favourable wind for a vessel
coming down the Adriatic, and not very
unfavourable for sailing up the west coast
of Italy. It would be in her teeth as she

tried to make the sti-aits of Messina. But

Horace’s winds are not more studied than*

his places and persons. The lover is waiting
till the weather changes and the winds are
mild and favourable, and that is all Horace
means. The Favonii are called ‘candidi’
as Notus and Iapyx are each called 4 albus’
(C. i. 7. 153 iii. 27.- 19).

4. fide, ] According to Aulus Gellius.
who has devoted a chapter to the subject
(ix. 14), the older forms of genitives of this
declension were four,‘ 88,’ ‘ei,’ ‘i‚ 'and‘ e.'
Most of the MSS. have‘ fidei‚’ one of Bent-
ley' s ‘fidi‚' a few‘ fide,’ which 18 generally
adopted now. “ Munera laetitiamque dii''
is Heyne's reading of Aen. i. 636. But in
Georg. i. 208 118 reads ⁴ die ' ’ΐοι- the geni-
tive. See Heyne’s and Wagner’s observa-
tions on those passages. Τ11γ11118 and Bithy-
nus are used indiscriminately by Horace.

5. Oricum] This was a town in Epirus,
situated at the top of the bay formed by the
Acroceraunian promontory. See Aen. x.
136 : ‘ Oricia terebintho.’ The constella-
tion of the great Amtssthea risen at the be-
ginning of October.

13. mulier perfida] Antea or Sthene-
baea. Smith's Dict. will give all particulam
of the stories of Proetus and Peleus here
referred to. Some writers make Astydamia,
others Hippolyte, the wife of Acastus, who,
out of revenge for his rejection of her, in—
duced her husband to expose Peleus to de-
struction. Josep h’ s virtue has its
in Grecian fablep Juvenal refers to them, .

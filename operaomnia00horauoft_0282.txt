HORATII FLACCI

Importunus enim transvolat aridas
Quercus, et refugit te quia luridi 10

Dentes, te quia rugae

Turpant et capitis nives.
Nec Coae referunt jam tibi purpurae
Nec clari lapides tempora, quae semel

Notis condita fastis

Inclusit volucris dies.
Quo fugit venus, heu, quove color? decens

Quo motus? quid habes

Quae spirabat amores,

Quae me surpuerat

Ἰ 5
illius, illius,
mihi, 20

Felix post Cinaram, notaque et artium
Gratarum facies? Sed Cinarae breves

Annos fata dederunt,

Servatura diu parem

Chia is a proper name, Baxter’s note there-
fore, “ tacetur Chiae puellae nomen,’' should
have been corrected by his editor Gesner.
⁴ Delia’ and ‘ Lesbia' are formed in the
sug? gabat in yonia] This is a close
imitation of Sophocles (Antig. 782),—

Ἐρως ὃς ἐν κτήμασι πίπτεις
ὃς ὲν μαλακαῖς παρειαῖς
νεάνιδος ἐννυχεύεις.

9. aridas Quercue,] This corresponds
to C. i. 25. 19, ‘aridas frondes;’ as to
‘luridi,’ see C. iii. 4. 74, n. ‘Te’ is de-
pendent on ‘refugit ' and ‘turpant’ in
both instances. ⁴ Capitis nives ’ Quintilian
(viii. 6. 17) quotes as an instance of far-
fetched metaphor. It has found its way
into most languages, however. But Quin-
tilian is only referring to the rhetorical style.

13. Coae] The transparency of these
Coan vestments is noticed S. i. 2. 101,
where see note.

14. clari] This, not ⁴ cari,' is the read-
ing of the greater number of MSS. and of
the Scholiasts. Bentley, Ι think with bad
taste, prefers ⁴ cari! The precious stones
of the costlier sort most in use by Roman
women were pearls (margaritae) and eme-
ralds (smaragdi). They were chiefly worn
in necklaces, and as ear-drops and rings;
and libertinae distinguished for their beauty
could make a great display of jewels received
as presents from their admirere.

15. Notis condita fastis] Horace means
to say that the days she has seen are all
buried, as it were, in the grave of the public

annals (as Acron says), and there any one
may find them, but she cannot get them
back. It is a graphio way of identifying the
{oezbse ἰὲἓοτιὲῗιιῖἲξιοῗιίξοέ is ᾱίείὲιξὲιιιξῖιέιῗ
by its consuls and its leading events.
‘ Notis ’ merely expresses the publicity and
notoriety of the record by which the lapse
of time is marked.

18. illius, illium] This word is very
emphatic, as in ‘¹ qnantum mutatus ab
ino Hectore ’' (Aen. 11274). On ⁸ surpu-
erat’ compare “unum me surpite morti ’'
(Sat. ii. 3. 283) C. i. 36. 8, n. ; S. i. 5. 79. n.
Regarding Cinara, see C. iv. 1. 3, n.; and for
the form ⁸ nota artium gratarum ’γ compare
‘⁴ notus in fratres animi paterni '' (C. ii. 2.
6). ‘ Parem temporibus' is not well ex-
plained by Orelli, “donec effecta sit par.”
It means rather that Lyce and the crow go
on together getting old and never dying.
⁴ Vetulae ' is a contemptuous form of
‘annosa’ used elsewhere (C. iii. 17. 13).
Martial speaks of an old woman who had

survived au the crows (x. 67). She'was the .

daughter (he says) of Pyrrha, and Nestor’s
stepmother, au old woman when Niobe was
a girl, grandmother of Laertes, nurse of
Priam, and mother-in-law of Thyestes.

28. Dilapsam] The form ‘delapsam '
is found in many MSS„ as usual, but few
editors have adopted it, and ‘ dilapsam ' is
plainly the word which expresses the crumb-
ling of a burnt-out torch. The idea is very
original. The contr-ast in ‘fervidi’ is ob-
viously intended.

HORATII FLAGGI

Et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum

Et juvenum curas et libera vina referre.

Discriptas servare vices operumque colores
cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor?
Gur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo?
¹Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult ;

Indignatur item privatis ac prope socco

Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decenter.

of the Dorio school, and the poen-y of the
Aeolio school. The former was adapted to
a choir. the latter only to a single voice.

The former was so called because it was
cultivated by the Dorians of the Peloponnesus
and Sicily : the latter flourished among the
Aeolians of Asia Minor, and particularly in
the island of Lesbos. Τ118 0118 celebrated
gods and heroes or renowned citizens, and
was used at public festivals or at marriages
and funerals: the other expressed individual
thoughts and feelings. Alcaeus and Sappho
are the chief representatives of the latter
school; of the former Alcman and Stesi-
chorus, Ibycus, Simonides, Bacchylides,
and Pindar. Stesichorus and Ibycus were
most celebrated for their poems on mytho-

logical subjects(‘ divos puerosque deorum '),

while Simonides and Pindarwere the greatest
in ἐπινίκια, hymns in honour of the victors
at public games (‘ et pugi gilem victorem et
equum certamine primum ',) while the poets
of wine and passion (⁸ juvenum curas et
libera vina’) ho, Si-
monidae, and Bacchylides. Horace does
not mention one class of lyric poems, the
threnes or dirges for the dead, of which
Simonides was the greatest master.

As to ‘libera vina' see S. i. 4. 87, n.

86. Diseriptae ater-vare vices] Ι (10 not
find that any MSS. have ‘discriptas,' but
Ι am much inclined to think that is the
true reading; and considering, as I have
said before, that‘ discribo’ is a genuine
form, and that the MSS. are unsafe guides
in regard to this word, Ι have adopted

‘discriptas' in preference to ‘descriptas'
(See C. ii. 13. 23, and Epp. i. 10. 20, n.)
⁸ Vicae ' are the parts (S. i. lo. 12, ⁴ defen-
dente vicem '), and with ‘discriptas' it

were Alcaeus, Sapp

means the parts assigned w each clm of
poeti-y. ‘ Operum 8010185( ‘the colouring
of poems, ' is easily understood.

88. pudens prave] ‘'I'hroug h a false

shame‚' ‘pudor malus’ (Epp .i. ιι186. 24).

91. coena Thyestae] See C. i. 6. 8, 11.

92. decentem] Bentley, upon very little
authority and on bad reasoning‚ substimtes

‘’decentem sor‘ decenter-,¹ the reading of
all the editions before him.

94. Iratusque Chremes]1’chmmeo is
put generally for any father in a eomedy.
There is nothing tragic or tamid in the lan-
guage of Clitipho's father in Terence’s play
(Heaut. v. 4), which is referred tio-hythe
commentatore. Tho intensive oompound
of ‘ litigo' does not occur elsewhere. As to

‘plerumque,' in the sense of ‘ interdum,’ 188

96. Telephus et Peterem] These persons
were the subjects of many tragedias.
of the three tragedians wrote upon ww as
will be seen from the fragments in Din-
dorf's collection. Telephus' ,obj eet con-
dition, when he went to seek for one to eure
him of his wound (see Epod. xvii. 8, 11.),
and Peleus, driven from Aegina, and wun-
dering' in quest of a purifici· for the murder
of his brother Phocus, appear to have been
the points in the history of these ns ¹

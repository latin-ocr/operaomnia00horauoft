HORATII FLAGCI

J um Flore, quibus terrarum militet oris

Claudius Augusti privignus scire laboro.

Thracane vos Hebrusque nivali compede vinctus,

An freta vicinas inter currentia turres,

An pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur? 5
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque curo.

Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?

Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum?

Quid Titius Romana brevi venturus in ora?

3. Thracane vos Hebrusque] The first
of these is the Latin form of the Greek
Θρῄκη. 11 1188 been observed before that
Horaoe generally uses the Latin termina-
tions in the Satires and Epistles, and the
Greek in the Odes. The Hebrus he else-
wh)ere calls “hiemi sodalem '' (C. i. 25.

4. vicinas inter currentia turrea] The
Scholiast Porphyrion says these were the
towers 01· castles of ero and Leander, at
Sestos and Abydos. e former stood on
the-European shore of the Hellespont, and
its modern name is Akbachi. The strait
takes a bend to the north-east between the
two towns, and Abydos stood directly south
of Sestos, at the distance of thirty stadis.
There is a village named Avido, which is
supposed to stand on the site of Abydos,
though others identify the site of the village
of Nagara with that of Abydos (see Creu-
zer's note on Herod. v. 117). Τ118 story of
Leander swimming by night repeatedly, till
he lost his life in a storm, from Abydos to
visit Hero the prioetess of Venus at Sestos
is well known from Ovid’s two Epistles
(Heroid. 18, 19) and Virgil (Georg. iii. 258,
sqq.). The same adventure was accom-
plished by Lord Byron and a companion in
the year 1810, 111 1118 111011111 of May. They
swam from the European shore to the
Asiatic, “ entering a considerable way above
the European, and landing below the Asiatic
fort.'' ‘⁸ Τ118 rapidity of the current is such
that no boat can row directly across. ''
They swam the distance, one in an hour
81111 five minutes, and the other in an honr
81111 1811 minutes, and calculated that they
had swam upwards of four English miles,
‘⁴ though the actual breadth is barely one.''
“ The water was extremely cold, from the
melting of the mountain snows.’' Accord-
ing to this account, which 1 have given in
Lord Byron's words, there are still two forts
on the opposite shores of the Hellespont in
the narrowest part, which is only seven

stadia wide (Herod. vii. 34). But 1118
European fort cannot- occupy the 8118 of
Sestos, which was higher up. It is probably
on the spot 10 which Xerxes’ bridge was
thrown over from Abydos, which Herodotus
calls ἀκτὴ τραχέα ἐς θάλασσαν κατήκουσα,
lying between Sestos and Madytus (Maito).
Itis not improbable that there was a fortified
town there, or a castle in former times, and
that Horace alludes to it in this place. 'rho
strength of the cun-ent above desa-iboni is
referredto in ¹ currentia) For ‘ tnrres' the
oldest Blandinian MS. had ⁴ terras) which
Bentley, “ semper novitatis avidusss' has
adopted, saying‚ that though we hear in
different poets of the tower of Hero at Ses-
tos, we hear nothing of a tower at Abydos,
the plain reason of course being that it was
necessary to the story that the priestess
should have a tower or some high place
from which to show the signal-light to her
lover. Abydus was a fortified place, and
stood more than one siege, and ‘tnrris’
does not necessarily mean a tower. It may
mean 8 sortified place or a 888118.

6. Quid studiosa cohors operum] As to
‘eohors,' see S. i. 7. 23,11. ‘Operum’
belongs to ‘ quid,' and signifies ‘ 111-1111138,1
either prose or poetry.

7. scribere sumit ?] Compare C. i. 12.
2, ‘⁴ sumis celebrare.'' ⁴ Sumere ' is some-
times used in a bad sense, as we nse ‘as-
sume‚’ ‘presume,' but it is not so here. It
is the word Horace generally uses* in th'm
connexion. See A. P. 38: “Sumite man
teriam vestris qui scribitis 88111181111711111118.η
With ‘diffundit in aevum,’ compare C. iv.
14. init: “ Quae cura patrum—Auguste,
virtutes in aevum—Aeternet.”

9. Quid Titius Romana] Of Titius the
Scholiasts say that he was a tragic and lyric
poet. Acron says that Horace is ridiculing
him for imitating Pindar, and that his
poetry was worth nothing ε “ libri ejus nul-
lius momenti erant.'’ Porphyrion, on the
other hand, says he was a person of great

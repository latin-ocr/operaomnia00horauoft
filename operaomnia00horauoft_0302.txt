HORATII FLAGGI

Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascuis,
Neque ut superni villa candens Tusculi

Circaea tangat moenia.

Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit: haud paravero

Quod aut avarus ut Chremes terra premam,
Discinctus aut perdam nepos.

agreeing with ‘ juvencis’ are bad. The
editors generally understand Horace to be
alluding to the rewards of service in the
field. He appears rather to be impressing
on Maecenas that he wishes to follow him
not for his bounty but his love.

27. pas-cuia] Several MSS. have ‘pas-
cua,' which Torrentius prefers, though all
his MSS. have ‘pascuis.' I do not see
much force in Bentley’s objection that with
‘ pascua' we should have three lines all
ending alike, ‘nitantur mea,' ‘mutet ,pas-
cua,’ ‘tangat moenia,' and 1 have some
difficulty in choosing. I have followed the
later editors. ⁴ Mutet ’ is used in the man-
ner so frequently found in Horace. See
C. i. 17. 2, 11. Varro (de Re Rust. ii. l.
16) says, “ Greges ovium large abiguntur
ex Apulia in Samnium aestivatum, atque ad
publioenum profitentur ne si inscriptum
pecus paverint lege censoria committant,''
where ‘inscriptum ’ means ‘unregistered,'
it being required that the cattle put to graze
on the public lands should be registered
with a view to the payment of the tax
(scriptura). See Cic. in Verr. Act. 11. 1. 11.
c. 70, Long’s note. The plains of Calabria
were very hot (⁴⁴ non aestuosae grata Cala-
briae armenta,’' C. i. 31. 5), and to these
the woody hills of Lucania formed a pleasant
contrast in summer.

29. Neque ut] The older editions have
‘nec.' ‘Nor that 1 may have a white
marble villa near the walls that Telegonus
built, the walls of Tusculum on the hill?
He says he does not want a villa at Tuscu-
lum where there were many handsome
houses besides that of Lucullus. See Cic.
de Legg. iii. 13. The ancient Tusculum,
Fea says, was built on the top of the hill of
which the modern town, Frascati, is built
on the slope. Fea says he has frequently
seen the ruins of the old town, which was
destroyed Λ.11. 1181 111 the civil wars. ‘ Cir-
caea’ is explained by C. iii. 29. 8, n.
Bentley conjectures ‘ supini ' for ‘ superni)
referring to ‘⁴ Tibur supinum,” C. iii. 4. 23.
But there is no variation whatever in the

MSS„ and supposing that what Bentley says
were true, that ‘ superni ’ could only be used
relatively, we may imagine that the highes-
part of the town (“ superius Tusculum,” as
Gesner says) was more agreeable than the
lower. But the word is used absolutely, as
may be seen by various examples quoted by
Foreeu. It is extraordinary that the expla-
nation of Lambinus should have found
favour with so intelligent an editor as Doe-
ring, ⁸ that the buildings on my farm should
be extended and reach to Tusculum, '
which was fifteen miles off. Lambinus says
he speaks in an hyperbole, as he certainly
would if that were his meaning. Many
editors have adopted that notion aud the
Scholiast Porphyrion gave it birth ; but his
words though obscure do not oonvey- that
meaning, ‘⁸ Circaea tangat moenia: Tus-
culum intelligendum. Sensus est autem ut
neque in Tusculo possideam villam quae
ibi aedificia habeat usque ad ipsam urbem.”
Others atter Acron (Turnebus, xii. 14) think
of a villa and farm reaching from Tus-
culum to Circaei in Latium, taking· ‘villa
Tusculi ' together.

8 character in some play of Menander's.

34. perdam nepos] This is a more agree-
81110 reading than the common one ⁸ ut
nepos.' It has the authority of Orelli's B,
but beyond this I find no authority for Dil-‚
lenbr.’s statement, ‘ sic antiquissimi mdioes!
‘ Ut’ is not omitted by any editor earlier
than Orelli, and the question is not raised
by any earlier commentator that 1 have seen.
The Scholiast Porphyrion had ‘ut' in his
copy, and the oldest known MS.. the Blan-
diuian of Cruquius‚ must have had it, or he
would have noticed the omission. Never-
theless it is probable that Horace wrote
⁴ perdam nepos& and that the second ‘ut ’
was inserted by copyists to oorrespond to
the first. Τ110 same construction occurs 111
S. i. 1. 101.

HORATII FLACOI

‘⁶ Quid, caput abscissum demens cum portat Agave
Gnati infelicis, sibi tum furiosa videtur3''

“ Stultum me fateor, liceat concedere veris,

Atque etiam insanum3 tantum hoc edissere, quo me

Aegrotare putes animi vitio ?”

“ Accipe:

primum

Aedificas, hoc est, longos imitaris ab imo
Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis, et idem

Corpore majorem rides Turbonis in armis

Spiritum et incessum: qui ridiculus minus illo?

An quodcunque facit Maecenas te quoque verum est
Tantum dissimilem et tanto certare minorem?
Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis,

Unus ubi effugit, matri denarrat, ut ingens
Illa rogare:

Belua cognatos eliserit.

timate construction and, supported as it is,
ought to be adopted.

303. Aqave] How she and the other
Maenads tore her son Pentheus to pieces
for intruding upon the orgies, is related at
length by Ovid (Met. iii. 701, sqq.) and
other authors referred to in Dict. Myth.
For ‘ manibus ' in this verse, the old edi-
tions, with scarcely an exception, have
⁸ demens! The oldest Blandinian MS. had
‘manibus,' which Bentley introduced into
the text on this authority, confirmed by
three other MSS. in his time, and since by
several mentioned by Fea. Why ¹ demens'
ever should have been forged, if ⁸ manibus ’
is the true reading, it is not easy to say.
‘Manibus' may have been invented from
Euripides, who two or three times speaks
of Agave with her son's head in her arms
(Bacch. vv. 967, 1137, 1275). These pas-
sages are produced by Bentley to prove
that Horace wrote ‘ manibus,' but this is
not proof. ⁶ Portat' expresses all that is
meant without the addition of ¹ manibus-⁹
All Orelli’s MSS., which are some of the
best, have ‘ demens? He edits ‘ manibus.'
The St. Gallen MS. 1183 ‘vel manibus’
superscribed over ‘demens.’

308. Aedificas, Ιιοο est,] ‘You are
bussding, which is as much 83 to say. you,
who are a dwarf two feet high, are aping the
airs of a giant ; and yet you laugh at Turbo
(a gladiator of great courage, but small
stature, Porph. says), swelling with a spirit
too big for his little body.' Horace may
have been making some additions to his
Sabine house. and about this time Maecenas
built 1113 large house on the Esquiliae (see
S. i. 8, Introd.). Priscian (p. 683, quoted

315

by Bentley), distinguishing Turbo, ·onis,
from ‘ turbo,’ a whirlwind, says the former
is the name of a gladiator, and quotes this
passage. Turbo 13 8 name found in in-

scriptions.
312. verum est] δίκαιόν &eng ‘is it
right ?' Compare Caesar, B. G. iv. 8:

“ Neque verum esse qui suos fines tueri non
potuerint alienos occupare.’' In the next
verse ‘ tantum ¹ has been restored to the
text on the authority of the oldoet Blan-
dinian MS. by Bentley, in whose time the
received reading was ‘tantm’ A similar
construction occurs immediately below (ver.
317), ‘tantum magna,’ where ‘ tandem ’ has
got into most MSS. and editions. ‘Mul-
tum similis’ (S. ii. 5. 92), ‘multum disai-
milis’ (Epp. i. 10. 3), are like phrases.

‘’Tanto is the dative governed by‘ certare-⁹

314. Absentis ranae] This fable is told
by Phaedrus (i. 24). The render will have
no difficulty in following the narrative of
Horace with the punctuation 1 have given,
which‘in the main is that of Heindorf and
Orelli. Great difficulty has been raised by
the little frog’s reply, that the ox was only·
‘ major dimidio ⁷ than his mother. Bentley
is particularly disturbed by this absurdity.
He himself (he says) would have written
¹ major namuro. ’ Heindorf suggests
disrespectfully that the ‘junge Frosch' is
laughing at his parent. We may at any
rate admit that ‘ greater by half' is a con-
ventional way of speaking, which can seldom
be interpreted very literally, and the inac-
curacy of the little frog may be excused.
There is a little more difficulty in the words
that follow, ⁴ num tanto Γ Bentley follows
Cruquius in changing ⁴ tanto' into ⁴ tantum:

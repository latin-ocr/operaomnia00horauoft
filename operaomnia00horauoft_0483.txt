Infamia. Quid, tunc rhombos

Tutus erat rhombus tutoque ciconia nido

Donec vos auctor docuit praetorius. Ergo

Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos,
Parebit pravi docilis Romana juventus.

*Sordidus a tenui victu distabit, Ofella
J udice ; nam frustra vitium vitaveris illud

Si te alio pravum detorseris.

ama-et ordocuit praetor-ina] On this
Porphyrioutellsuathat one Rufuswasthe
first to bring into fashion the eating of
atorksg aud when he was a candi-
fioe the praetorahip (which is a little
mnu-diction, since aster Horace he calls
him ‘praetorium’ but that does not much
napta, the story is equa& good), being
rejected, the following epigram was made
upon him :—
“ Ciconiarum Rufus iste conditor
Hic est duobus elegantior Plancis ε
Suffragiorum puncta non tulit septem.
Ciconiarum populus ultus est mortem.’'

who the Planci were we do not know, but
they must have stood for some office, and
were ‘ eleganter emuncti? though Rufus
was ‘elegantius.' When he lived it is im-

⁴ ciconia‚’ in which case he deserved well of
thooe who liked living. The stork
went out of fas'hion, as Ofella predicts; and
though gulls did not take its place, oeauoe
came into vogue‚ as Ean-e has pointed out
stom Pliny (N. H. x. 23, ξ 30). See S. ii.
8. 87. Aa to ‘anoton’ see C. i. 28. 14, ιι.
The word ‘edixerit' is a play upon the
‘edictum’ of the ‘ praetor!

yourself awry.' Bentley, on the authority

ofone MS„ reads‘ 1).'ravus Ι secuere&
son for deserting the preceived reading, with
the weight of authority that it has.

The Scholiasta have
nothing to tell us of this miser. The MSS.
aredivided between ‘ductum’ aud‘ dictum!
In this, as in the last mse, either would do.

the reading of the old editions and many
others, as well aa some of the best MSS„
siguifies, as mentioned before, to draw from
the ‘dolium’ into the ‘amphora‚’ ‘testa,’
or ‘’cadus (all the same kind of vessel), in
which it was kep ttill itwasfittodrink.
When poured from thence into the‘ crater’

‘'defusum, and that is the only word that
has any meaning here. This miser's wine
was of a poor kind, probably not fit to be
bottled in the sxrst instance, but only to be
drank from the ‘doliuml He bottled it,
and did not produce it for consumption till
it was sour.

59. licebit Ille repotia] On‘ licebit‚'
seeEpod. xv. 19. ‘Repotia’ wasa‘ coeua'
sometimes given the day aster marriage by
the husband. Ι am not aware that any ex-
planation of the custom is to be met with.
The marriage-diuner was given by the hus-
band. Asthatwasusuallyasceneof
nothing but uuroetrained merriment, per-
haps the religious ceremonias required pro-
perly to inaugurate the new life of the mn·-
ried oouple, and to propitiate the penates
aud laras, were usually defer-red to thia
day; and the sobriety of the ‘repotia' was
probably daigned to make amends for the
license of the ⁴ coena ιιιῷῒὶιιίἰε3 The Ro-
mans observed their birthdays with much
relig-lons accuracy, and with festivities equal
to our own. See note ou C. iv. 11. 8. They

HORATII FLAGGI

Accipe quid contra juvenis responderit aequus:
In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus ut aprum

Goenem ego3 tu pisces hiberno ex aequore verris..

235

Segnis ego, indignus qui tantum possideam: aufer:
Sume tibi decies 3 tibi tantumdem tibi triplex
Unde uxor media currit de nocte vocata. ·

Filius Aesopi detractam ex aure Metellae,

Scilicet ut decies solidum absorberet, aceto

240

Diluit insignem baccam: qui sanior ac si
Illud idem in rapidum flumen jaceretve cloacam?

233. aequum] This is ironical. The
young man affecting to be just shows a
wanton extravagance towards the most pro-
fligate persons.

234. In nive Lucana] Bentley puts
‘tu’ for ιἱιι;’ but the pronoun does not
appear in any MS„ and is not wanted.
Dramatic transitions like this are affected,
not by pronouns, but by turning to the
person addressed. It appears from this
passage and S. 8. 6, that Lucanian boars
were particularly prized. Martial mentions
an Etrurian boar as a great present he had
received. Horace, in the next Satire (ver.
40) recommends the Umbrian boar above
the Laurentian, or those found in the mai-shy
land on the coast of Latium, in the neigh-
bourhood of Laurentum, about sixteen
miles from the mouth of the Tiber. The
same cause that gave the Umbrian boar its
zssfflsszwglfffffivzgsssuth? &inssiz
chesnuts of the Apennines, which are still
considered in Italy the best food for hogs,
wild and tame. The boar was usually
served up whole at large tables, and formed
the principal dish. The ‘ocrea ’ was a
leather gaiter that came up to the knee and
round the calf like the soldier's greaves,
and was called from them.

235. verris] Many MSS. and the old
editions have ‘vellis,’ which Acron (who
mentions the reading ‘verris ') explains
“cum difficultate trahis.” Cruquius says
all his MSS. have ‘verris‚' which Lam-
binus also adopts. Bentley does the same
and most modern editors, and 1 think they
are right. ⁴ Venis' conveys no sense to my
mind. See note on S. 4. 37. Silius uses
‘verro ¹ in this sense (xiv. 262) :—

“ Seu silvis sectere feras, seu retibus aequor
Veri-ere seu caelo libeat traxisse volucrem.''

237. tibi decies ,·] ⁴ Decies centena mil-
lia sestertium :' ten hundred thousand

saetercii, not much under 90001„ which
sum is given to the huntsman, the same
to the fishmonger, but three times that

. amount to the pander who was in the habit

of lending his own wife to the lust of this

most MSS. and of the best. Others have
‘‚’currat andthatappearsinmostofthe
editions of the sixteenth century. ‘’Gan-at
would mean that the money was given as
an inducement to the man to send his wife.

239. Filius Aeeopi] Aesopus, the mor,
amassed great wealth. The name of his
son who inherited it was Clodius, which was
the father's name, given him perhaps as a
freedman of some one belonging to the
Clodia gens. See Pliny, N. H. ix. 35, ξ
59, where this story οῖ the ear-ring is told.
Caecilia Metella was the wifeot' P. Cornelius
Lentulus Spinther, and was divorced by
him amuc- 709, inconsequenceofherin’-
trigues, chiefly with Dolabella, ciomo’ s
son· in· law, of whose profligacy Amop’s

mentions thern together m aletter to Aeti-

cus(xi. 15),ι ‘ea—quae me conficiunt. ad
quae gener accedit et meten quae fletu
reprimor ne smbam. Quin etiam Aewpi
filius me excrudat.” A to Por-
phyrion he fell under the abusa of the
poet Maevius (“de hoc Maevius poete
scribit '’)‚ which places him in better coni·-
pany than he deoerves, for that msn’e abne

Clodius is also (as’ ιε better known) related
of Cleopatra. See Pliny (ubi sup. ἃ 58)
and Suetonius (Vit.c21ig.c.37). Aesopus,
the actor, was not less extravagant than hu
son, see below, v. 245, ιι.

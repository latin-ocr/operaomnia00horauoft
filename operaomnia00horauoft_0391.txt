SATIRARUM Ι. 4. 361

⁶ ARGUMENT.

Greutwaeflielibetywherewith thoseworthhs of the old comedyset their markupon
the vicium, and them Lucilius has copied3 a man of wit and perception, but a harsh
utilia-3 caring lesa for the quality of his verses than the quantity3 fun of words and

’ tull off-um, which he was too lazy to avoid. As to your quantity, 1 care not for that;
and whm Crispinus challenges me et great odds to try which of us can write quickoet,
1 decline the invitetiom and thank heaven thot 1 am a man of quiet temperament and
few words. He may go on puffing and blowing like a pair of bellows. but that is not
m my way.

(v. 21.) Fannius gets a testimonia from his admirers, while no one will read what 1 write
(and 1 am too nervous to redte it in public), because men do not like to have their
faults exposed, and there are few who arc not open to blame. Tnke any man out of a
crowd, hc is avaria'ous or ambitious or lecherous, or he dotes upon fine plsoe or fine
ωας οι· is running about the world to make his fortune. All such are afraid of
verses like mine, and hate those who⁶ write them. “ Tnke cere of him ς he is danger-oum
all he cares for is to get up a laugh and amuse the old women and children at the
expense of his friends?

(maa.) Now let me saya word in reply. In the first place 1 do notprofess to be a poet.
Sixfeetinaversewhichotherwiseis mere prose, thisdoee not mnkeapoet‚but
genius, inspiration, and sublime lmgmge. And this has led some to question whether
comedyis poetry, seeing thot the language and ideas are all those of common life.
There are your tatheus, for instance, scolding their sons, just as you may hear every
dny3 momover you may shuffie the words ns you please in true poetry without elter-
ingthe εοαεο, but that is not the case with Lucilius’ language and mine (γοα must read
it as you would prose, or you make nonsense of it).

(v. 83.) But this question I may discuss elsewhere. My present purpose is to show that
you have no reason to be afraid of this sort of writing. There are your informers who
go about md are the terror of all roguea : the honest men may daepise them. But,
even supposing you are the rogue, 1 am no informer. 1 have no daeire to have my
books thumbed by the vulgar, or to read them to any but my friends, and that only
when prest- There are many 1 grant you who bawl their versae in the forum and in
the public batha, bnt they ane mere blockheads. ‘⁴ But we know you love to ennoy, and .
do it with malicious intent.'' How can you charge me with this? Nay, the man who
slanders his friend behind his back, or fnils to defend him from the slander of others,
who aims onlyat being called a wit, who invents falsehoods and blsbs sem-ets, that man
is a sconndrel3 let every honest citizen avoid him. 1 have osten been at table when one
of the company has amused himself with breaking his wit upon the gnome, not sparing
the host himself when he gets warm3 now this man you look upon ss a funny fellow,
while for my innocent satire Ι am called malignant, mentio, and so forth. When
your friend Petillius is mentioned you defend him aster your own fashion, that is, you
damn him with a sneer, the verioet poison, which shall never be found, if I know
myself at all. in any thing 1 may write.

(v. 103.) If 1 have spoken a little too freely of others 1 may be piu-doned on this ground:
my excellent &ther always taught me by examplae. If he would have me live frugaliy,
he would say, ‘⁴ Look at the misery to which our friend Albius’ son and Barrus have
reduced themselves by their extravagance.” When he would keep me from bad women,
‘⁴ Take Semnus for a warning.” “ See what scnndal attaches to Trebonius.” ‘⁴ Wiser
men may teach γοα by precept and theory, my care shall be to watch over your prac-
tice tiu you are able to take care of yourself.” If he would have me do something that
was right, he would take one of the judices and say, ‘⁸ There is sn example for you. ”

HORATII FLAOGI

Floribus et vino Genium memorem brevis aevi.

Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem

Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit,
Libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos
Lusit amabiliter, donec jam saevus apertam
In rabiem coepit verti jocus et per honestas

Ire domos impune minax.

Dente lacessiti 3 fuit intactis quoque cura
Condicione super communi; quin etiam lex

iu the old language signified a cow. See
Ovid (Fast. iv. 629, sqq.) z
“Tertia post Veneris cum lux surrexerit
Ροξιῖἕὲεε forda sacra litate bove.
Forda ferens bos est fecundaque, dicta
Hifiiedeeiltissm foetus nomen habere putant.
Nunc gravidum pecus est; gravidae nunc
semine terrae 3
Tenuri plenae victima plena datur.’'

But it appears that sacrifices were also
offered aster harvest, and that the victim
was a hog, which was commonly offered to
the Lares (C. iii. 23. 4, where the feminine
is used. S. ii. 3. 165. C. iii. 17. 5. Epp. i.

143.) Silvanum lacte piabant‚] In Epod.
ii. the offerings to Silvanus are fruits, and
there he is spoken of as ⁴ tutor finium ε’ in
Tibullus (i. 5. 27) he is called ⁴ deus
agricola: and the offerings are different
for wine, corn, and flocks, all of which he
protected. Ι
“ Illa deo sciet agricolae pro vitibis uvam,

Pro segete spicas,*pro grege ferre dapem.’'
Juvenal (vi. 447) mentions a hog as an
offering to this god, to whom women
were not allowed to sacrifice, as appears
from that passage. He is represented with
a pruning hook in one hand, and a basket
of fruit and a eypress bough in the other.
The last is connected with a story of his
killing a hind which belonged to Cyparis-
sus, who died of grief in consequence.

144. Genium memorem brevis-aeut] See
Epp. i. 7. 94, n.

145. Fescennina per hunc inventa licen-
tia] Bentley, on no authority but on the
suggestion of Barthius, reads ‘invecta’ All
the MSS. have ‘inventast There was a
sort of rude jesting dialogue carried on in
extempore verse at these rustic festivals,
full of good-tempered raillery and coarse
humour. These were called ‘Fescennina
carmina: as is generally supposed from the

town Fescennia or Fescennium, belonging
to the Falisci (see Niebuhr, Rom. nist. i.
136). Other etymologica havebeen given
(see Forcell.). From these verses others
took their name, which were more lioenuous
and scurrilous. Epithalamia, usually of
an obscene character, were called ⁴ Fescen-
nini versus ’ (see Catullus lxi, 12⁶, -iu
Nuptias Juliae et Manlii: .
“ Neu diu taceat procax
Fescennina locutio ''),

and satires got the same name, bat the sort
of poetry with which it originated was
harmless, as Horace says (compare Vicgil,
Georg. ii. 385, sqq.):
“ Necnon Ausonii, Troja gens missa, coloni
Versibus incomptis ludunt risuque soluto;
Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis3
Et te, Bacche, vocant per carmina laeta,
&c.'' · -

Tibullus (ii. 1. 51, sqq.) refers to the aongs
of the rustics at harvest time: ἢ
“Agricola assiduo primum satiatus aran-o
Cantavit certo rustica verba pede3
Et satur arenti primum est modufflzus
Gai-323, ut ornatos diceret ante deos.
Agricola ‘et minio suffusus, Bacche, ru-
Pnpgng inexperta duxit ab arte chom.''

152. quin etiam Iex Poenaque lata]
See S. ii. l. 80, 11. ‘ Lata ' properly belongs
to “ lex :' when a penalty was inserted in the
‘lex'it was ‘lex sancta,’ as stated in the
note just referred to. The authority in

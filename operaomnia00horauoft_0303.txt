CARMEN ΙΙ.

Horace, meaning to write on the praises of the country, put his poem (whether as an
ιω· thought or not may be open to conjecture) into the shape of a rhapsody by a money-
goffingumer who, aster reciting the bleesings of s country life and sighing sor the enjoy-
mcnt of them, resolving to throw up his business and persuading himself that he desirae
nothing so much as retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong for him and falls
beck upon the sordid pursuits which atter all are most congenial to him. Some may
perhapsthink that this little bit of satire is the chief object for which the poem was
written. My impression is that it was commenoed (whether ιιι imitation of virgil, Georg.
ii. 458‚sqq.‚nsF1-anke supposes, or of some poem of Archilochus as Lachmann, or not
in imitntion of any thing which is more probable) as a‘ ‘laudatio vitae rusticae” (which is

Ι the tenor of most of the inscriptions), and that the last four verses, which have been called

clumsy, were added to give the roet a moral. At any rate the greater part of the speech
must be admitted to be rather out of keeping with the supposed speaker. We should not
expect, sor instance, to hear a city usurer talk about an hereditary farm, the dnngers of
the soldier and the sailor, and the caroe of love. The int difficulty is got rid of by Doering
and others, who interpret ⁴ amor ’ (v. 37) as the love of money, which that editor says
‘⁸ vix dubitari potest,'’ though the word ¹ habendi ¹ ¹¹ paulo licentius omisit-'¹ This 1
ν am quite sure is wrong3 and 1 thinkwe must allow that Horacewas more intent upon
his description than on maintaining an accurate consistency between the ch-cumstanoae of
the speaker and the sentiments he utters. But, however this may be, the picture is very
heauflful and the moral very true. In the most sordid minds more genial impulses will'
monimen uriae : but the benutie· of nature and the charms of a peaceful retirement are,
like virtue itnelf, only atti-active in the distance and at intervals to minds that have grown
addicted to the pursuit of gain for its own sake. To such minds domestic and innocent
pleasurea offer no lasting gratification, and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the one
hand, and of the jaded but still grasping usurer struggling for a moment against his
propensities on the other, affords a wholesome lesson for many. In respect to the date,
it can only be conjectured that Horace had tasted the enjoyments he describesfso graphi-
mlly, and was in possession of his farm. But even that is uncertain. Franke, thinking
that Horace must have had before him Virgil’s second Georgic (458, sqq.)‚ which some say
ω not published till A.u.c. 724, attributos this ode to 724 also, in which his friend
Lachmann informs him he seems “ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus esse.’' There is
a fragment from the comedy Νῆσοι attributed to Aristophanes (344, Dind.), which is
very like this ode.. Whether Horace ever saw it or thought of it when he was writing it
is impossible to say. It runs thus :—

ὦ μῶρε μῶρε, ταῦτα πάντ’ ἐν τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οἰκεῖν μέν ἐν ἀγρῷ τοῦτον ἐν τῷ γηδίῳ
ἀπαλλαγέντα τῶν κατ’ ἀγορὰν πραγμάτων,
κεκτημένον ζευγάριον οἰκεῖον βοοῖν.

ἔπειτ’ ἀκούειν προβατίων βληχωμένων
τρυγός τε φωνὴν εἰς λεκάνην ὣθουμένης,
ὄψῳ τὲ χρῆσθαι σπινιδίοις τε καὶ κίχλαις
καὶ μὴ περιμένειν ἐξ ἀγορᾶς ἰχθύδια
τριταῖα, πολυτέμητα, βεβασανισμένα

ἐπ’ ἰχθυοπώλου χειρὶ παρανομωτάτῃ.

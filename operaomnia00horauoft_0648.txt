EPISTLE XV.

This Epistle, as the chronologists rightly assume, is not likely tohave been written
before A.n.c. 731, when Antonius Musa and his cold remedies came into fashion (v. 3, n.).
How long afterwards it may have been written is uncertain.

Vala was the cognomen given to one C. Numonius for storming the vallum of a camp,
as appears from a coin with his head on one side, and the above exploit represented on
the other. The Scholiasts say nothing of Horace’s friend, but the MSS. inscriptions mu
him C. Numonius Vala. There was one of that name who was a legatus of Varus, and
perished with his army in Germany A.u.c. 763, thirty years or more after this Epistle
was written. He may have been this man or his son. Estre has given an inscription
found at Philae in Egypt, 111 which it appears that two persons—L. Trebonius and C.
Numonius Vala—were at that place ‘⁴ A.D. V111. K. Aprilis,” in the year when Augustus

was consul the thirteenth time, that is, A.o.c. 752. If this be Horace's friend, as it may, ,

118 was a traveller like Bullatius, and has succeeded in recording his travels for a longer
time than he expected. But this does not help us to distinguish him from many travel-
lers who have carved their ignoble names upon the sphinxeS, obelisks, and Pyramids of
Egypt.

Vala was acquainted with the southern coast of Italy, and Horace, who had been re-
commended by his physician no longer to go as he had been wont to Baiae, had a mind
to try one of the southern ports3 and he writes to Vala for information about them. It
is an uuconnected sort of Epistle, with a long digression upon the lament of Baiae at the
loss of her invalids, and another upon wines, and a third, which occupies half the Epistle,
upon the profligacy of one Maenius, who squandered all his money on good living, and
then turned to living at the expense of others. When he had nothing better he ate tripe

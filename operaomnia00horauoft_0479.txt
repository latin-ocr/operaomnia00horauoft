Discite, non inter lances mensasque nitentes

Cum stupet insanis acies fulgoribus et cum ⁵
Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat,

Verum hic impransi mecum disquirite. Cur hoc?

Dicam si potero. Male verum examinat omnis

Corruptus judex.

9. Ουννιιρὶιιε]ιιιίε.ι·.] Horace likens the
msn whose judgment is biassed by n fine
table aud good dinner to a judex who has
been mapa-ed with. (See C. iv. 9. 39, π.)

- Leporem uectatus equove] There is
some confusion raised ἰιι this long sentence
by the introducu'on of the words ⁴ pete ce-
dentem net-a diseo! Horace means at first
to say ‘⁴ when you have tired yourself with
hunting the hare, with riding an unbroke
horse, or (supposing the'rougher sports are
too much for you) with ball play or throw-
ing the diam, and are dry and hungrys
then see ir you will despise the communest
food, and call for rich mulsum.” Instead
of which he says: “affer hunting the bare
or wenrying yourself with riding, or if (sup-
posing you are only accustomed to Greek
sports, and the Roman are too much for
you) ball play occupien you or the discus,
then throw the discus; but when fatigue
shall have banished fastidiousnaes, and you
are dry and hungry, then see if ’' διο.

‘Romana militin’ corresponds to what
Cicero says (de Nat. Deor. ii. 64): “exer-
ceamur in venando ad similitudinem bellicae
disciplinae.’' As may be seen by this
passage, the hall play, which was so common
an amusement in one shspe or other among
the Romans, was introducedfroin Greece,
though the Romans had varietioe
of their own invention. The most violent
form however, ‘ ,' ω borrowed
from the Greeks, who also bad die sevoeer
exemise of football, which the Romans had
not. The thro-ing of the discus likewise
was of Greek origin,and belonged to the
heroicage. Thenstureofthedisms is
seen in the fizmous sintne of the δισεόβολος
by Myron, of which caste cre common, nnd
ofwhich thereis agood copyinthessiitish
Museum. A wood-engraving of this statue,
and an account of the discus, will be found
in Smith’s Dict. Antt. The specimen of
Greek effeminacy mentioned in C. iii. 24.
57,the ‘trochus,'is more to the purpose

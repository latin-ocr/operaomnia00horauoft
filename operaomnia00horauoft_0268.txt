238 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN VIII.

All that is known of C. Marcius Censorinus, the person‚to whom this ode is addressed‚
may be found in Smith’s Dict. Biog. (CensorInus, 6). He was a man of birth aud
education‚ and much beloved, according to Velleius, who says of his death, ‘⁴ Graviter
tulit civitas.” Horace pays him the compliment of believing that he would esteem an
ode of his more highly than any costly gifts he could offer in accordance with the com-
mon practice among friends of making each other presents (strenas) on new-year’s day
and other festivals. We have no means of determining when the ode was written. But
see C. iv. 6, Introduction.

ARGUMENT.

If 1 were rich in statues and pictures, 1 would give such to my friends, and the best to thee,
Censorinus. But 1 have none, and thou desirest not these. What 1 have 1 offer,—
verses in which thou delightest. No monuments of marble, not their own mighty deeds
could ennoble the Scipiones like Ennius' verses. Thine own virtues must remain obscure
but for the muse. What would Aeacus or Romulus have been without her? She
raises men to the skies, as she did Hercules, the Tyndaridae, and Liber.

DoNAnEM pateras grataque commodus,
Censorine‚ meis aera sodalibus,

Donarem tripodas, praemia fortium

Graiorum, neque tu pessima munerum

Ferres, divite me scilicet artium 5
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopas,
Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.
Sed non haec mihi vis, non tibi talium
Res est aut animus deliciarum egens.
Gaudes carminibus ς carminapossumus
Donare et pretium dicere muneri.

“ Quis fuit horrendos primus qui protulit
enses ?'' which however is not quite tho
same thing. ‘Ponere’ is a more common

l. commodum] liberally. “ Miscentur
cyathis procula commodis '' (C. iii. 19. 12).
5. artium,] Though this is the only

passage that Forcellini quotes for ‘ artes' as
‘ works of art,' it occurs in the same sense
Epp. i. 6. 17: ‘⁴ Marmor vetus aeraque et
artes Suspice.” Also in Cic. (de Legg. ii.
2), “antiquorum artibus ;'' and in Virg.
( Aen. v. 359), “ clypeum— Didymaonis
artes.'' This sense of ⁴ proferre‚’ to produce
as we say a work of art, is not given by
Forcell. Orelli quotes Tibull. (i. 10. l),

word. Persius uses it (i. 70) 2—-

“ Ecce modo heroas sensus afferre videmus
Nugari solitos Graece, nec ponere lucum
Artifices, nec rus saturum laudm-02¹

Ovid (A. A. iii. 401): “ Si Venerem Cous
nusquam posuisset Apelles.” See A. P.
34: “ Quia ponere totum Nesciet-'¹

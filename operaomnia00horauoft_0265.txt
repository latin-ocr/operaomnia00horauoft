CARMEN VII.

Thatufisodeisnddressedtothesameperson as the fiflzh epistle of thefirst book is
pretty eea-nin. Thac person πω an advocate (v. 9), and this is commended for his
eloquenoe (v. 23); that person m busy in making money, md so was this. But who
this Torquatus was we have no means of deciding. Estre (Prosop. Hor. p. 497) suggens
that it mny have been Aulus Torquatus mentioned by Nepos in his Life of Atticm (c. ll),

been written, which Ι think not at all unlikely, about the same time ns that, its not having
been inserted in the first publication would be aoeounted for by that memblnnoe, and its
being inserted in this was probably for the purpose of making up a fasdussu to publish

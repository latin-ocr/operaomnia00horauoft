as 1.. Volteius, a friend of L. Metelluss ιιι
Cic. inVerr. ii. 3.66. A freedman took

Meuodorus (see Bpod. iv. Int.) as Demas
to Demetrius, Lucas to Lucanus, Silas to
Silvanus, Artemas to Artemius. διο.

56. eine crimine, notum Ee] The punc-
tuationofthis passage hasbeen muchdis-
σικαί. Orelli and others take ‘notum’
absolutely for a man well known, quoting
Caesar (B. C. 19): ‘⁴ non civis Romanus

paulo notior quin ad diem conveniret ;” aud 155
- Bpp. i.6.25: “Cum bene nomm Porticus

Agrippae et via te conspexerit Appi.”
Imbinus and mauyaflzerhim take⁴ notum’
with· sine mimine! Ithink it belongsto
the verbs that follow, which nearly all the
editors suppose
The desa-ip tion Menas gives of himself
isthat heis acn'erof smallmeans, of un·
blemished character, well known as a person
who could be active or quiet as the occasion
required, and who enjoyed what he got,
one who made himself happy in the com-

pany of humble people, in the possession

to depend on ‘lgaudentem

of a house of his-own, at the flieatres and

Circus, and with the amusements of the
Campus Martius. ‘Et quaerere et uti‚’ ‘to
get and to enjoyss expresses the reverse
of him who is ‘nescius uti Compositis’
(S.ii.3.109).1.nreoertonsopposedto
al ‘’coenaculum (Epp. i.1. 91, ιι).
It appears (v. 65) that he transacoed busi-
ness as a sellerg probably he had some
second hand things of hisown to dispo-e of.
Butthe ‘praeco' was not usually the per-V
son who an ‘suctim ' which m
presided over by an ‘argentarium' and he
employeda‘ praeco! SeeS. i.6. 86, ιι.

‘Lare curto' from two MSS. of Cruqnius,

“modicis penatibus” (Tac. Ann- ii. 84).
But supposing that Horace would have
used ‘curto' where he could have said

repetition of ‘tenui censu' above, and

), “Et patriam solae et oertoe novere
penates:” and (Aen. vi. 673)⁴ ‘Nulli certa

Epp. i. 15. 28: “Scurra vagus non qui
certum praesepe teneret?

It is an adverb of emphasis. As to ‘be-

junctive ‘neget’ compare S. ii. 6. 31.

OARMINUM II. 20.

Me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus et ultimi
Noscent Geloni, me peritus

Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor.

Absint inani funere neniae ,

Luctusque turpes et querimoniae3

Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
Mitte supervacuos honores.

> where else, how fieqtaently Horace ends the

third verse of the Alcaic sunm with a word
that belongs immediately to the last word
of the stanza. The remark is Dillenbr! s,
and it is worth attending to. The Daci
were not finally subdned flu the reign of
Trajan. But see C. 1i. 9. 23, ιι.

24. Super-naeuos] The prose-writers
before Pliny used the form‘ supervacaneus!
Forcellini quotes one pasmge from Oicem
(de Nat. Deor. i. 33), in which he says some
editions have‘ supervacuus? All modern
editions have the other form.

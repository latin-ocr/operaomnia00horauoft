Sublimis cupidusque et amata relinquere pernix.

HORATII FLAGOI

1⁶5

Conversis studiis aetas animusque virilis
Quaerit opes et amicitias, inservit honori,
Commisisse cavet quod mox mutare laboret.

Multa senem circumveniunt incommoda, vel quod
Quaerit et inventis miser abstinet ac timet uti,

170

Vel quod res omnes timide gelideque ministrat,
Dilator, spe longus, iners, avidusque futuri,
Difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis acti

Se puero, castigator censorque minorum.

Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Ne forte seniles

Multa recedentes adimunt.

175

Mandentur juveni partes pueroque viriles,
Semper in adjunctis aevoque morabimur aptis.
Aut agitur res in scenis aut acta refertur.

Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,

180

Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae

Ipse sibi tradit spectator: non tamen intus
Digna geri promes in scenam, multaque tolles
Ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praesens.

172. epe lonqua] “Quia tardus est et
difficilis ad sperandum, propter experien-
tiam fallacis fortunae ” (Forcellini). The
expression is peculiar, and other interpre-
tations have been given, but Ι believe that
this is the true one. So Dacier renders it,
“longue a concevoir des esperances.” Bent-
ley substitutes ‘lentus ' out of his own
head. ⁴ Avidus futuri ¹ means I suppose
⁴ eager to live longer,’ or ‘greedy of life,’ but
it is an odd expression.

175. Multa ferunt anni] See C. ii. 5.
14, n.‚ and Epp.· ii. 2. 55. The remark
seems to be drawn forth by the dark picture
of old age contained in the preceding verses.
It hasmot‘ much otherwise to do with the
subject.

17 δι adjunctis aevoque morabimur aptis. ]
Both ‘adjunctis’ and ‘aptis’ go with ‘aevoss
¹ we shall dwell upon that which attaches
and is fitted to the age we have in hand!

179. aut acta refertum] The following
remarks of Miiller (Hist. Gr. Lit. i. 307)
appear to be true :—·‘ The actions to which
no speech is attached, and which do not
serve to develope thoughts and feelings, are
imagined to pass behind or without the
scene, and are only related on the stage.
Hence the importance of the parts of mes-
sengers and heralds in ancient tragedy. The
poet was not influenced only by the reason
given by Horace (vv. 185, sqq.); there was

also the far deeper general reason, that it is
never the outward act with which the inter-
est of ancient tragedy is most intimately
bound up. The action is internal and spiri-
tual3 the reflections, resolutione, feelings,
the mental or moral phenomena which ean
be expressed in speech, are developed on
the stage. For outward action, which is
generally mute or at all events cannot be
adequately expressed by words, the Epic
form, narration, is the only appropriate
vehicle. Moreover, the costume of tragic
actors was calculated for impressive decla-
mation and not for action. The lengthened
and stnffed out figures would have had ιιιι
awkward, not to say a ludicrum effect in
combat or other violent action. From the
sublime to the ridiculous would have been
but one step, which ancient tra'gedyoero-
fully avoided riskingl'

180. Sey nius irritant animm] When
Candaulesp proposes to exhibit his 1ίίοέ
beauty to Gyges, Herodotus (i. 8) makes

say, ὦτα γὰρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώποισι
ἐόντα ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, and Seneca
(Epp. vi.) has a like saying, “Homines
amplius oculis quam auribus creduntss'

184. facundia praecem. ] An ey e- wit-
ness who tells the spectatore what he has
seen, and does it in the flow of a long set
speech. ⁴ Praesens ’ meanz ⁴ before the an-

dience.’

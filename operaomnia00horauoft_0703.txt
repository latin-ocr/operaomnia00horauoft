Ut patris attenti, 1en0nis ut insidiosi ;
Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis,
μ Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco ;

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere, post hoc

175

Securus cadat an recto stet fabula talo,

Quem tulit ad scenam ventoso Gloria curru
Exanimat lentus spectator, sedulus inflat:

Sic leve, sic parvum est, animum quod laudis avarum

Subruit aut reficit.

Valeat res ludicra si me

180

Palma negata macrum, donata reducit opimum.
Saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poetam,
Quod numero plures, virtute et honore minores,
Indocti stolidique, et depugnare parati

Si discordet eques, media inter carmina poscunt

185

Aut ursum aut pugiles ; his nam plebecula plaudit.

173. Quantus rit noemam] Because
this is not known from other quarters
it· 15 assumed by some that the name is not
thatofawriter, butofacharacterinaplay
of Plautus. This appears as a gloss' 111 the
margin of one of Orelli' s MSS:
11110.- 110 00111100.” Comm. Cruq., 011
theotberhand, says hewas awriter of
Atallane pysla 'nim can be little doubt,
from the position of the name here, that it
re ts a comic writer of the day. Pliny
(xiv. 13) mentions one Fabius Dossennus.
The verses Pliny quotes are supposed not
to have been his, but Plautus', and the man
himself Orelli thinks was a grammarian or
a jurisconsultus not a poet. Seneca
(Epp. 89. 5) quotes the epitaph of one
Dossennus, which Estre and many others
suppose to be the person that Horace men-
tions. But, however this may be, 1 have
110 doubt Dossennus here· 15 a cornic poet.
Some MSS. and editions have Dorsennus.

174. percurrat pulpita rocco, ·] The
front part of the stage where the actcrs
spoke was called‘ pulpitum? by the Greeks
λογεῖον. Asto‘ soccus ’seeS.i..‚3127
11. Itwas worn bycomic edors, as being
a less dignified order of covering for the
feet than the‘ cothurnus) A good repre—
sentation of it will be found in the Dict.
Ant. Other shoes worn in comedy were

‘baxeae' and crep idae? forthe same reason,

“Domn-

= each being a 10050 sort of slipper, and the
z latter notg materially different, as observed

before, from the‘ soccus) Horace means
that Dossennus 15 00101055 111 the composi-
tion of his play 5, which he expresses by his

. running about th’e stage with loose slippers.

His only care, he says, is to make money.
The aediles, or any 0110 11110 cared to put
a new play upon the stage, paid for it.
According to Suetonius, Terence got 80⁰0
sesterces for his Eunuchus, which he says
wasalargersum than hadeverbeen given
for a comedy before.

186. Aut ursum aut psyileae ,·] Augustus
himself had 0 liking for boxers, as mentioued
on Epp. i. l. 49. The interruptions to the

drama which Horace here mentions
appear to have been of common occurrence.
Terence complains that the representation
of the Hecyra was interrupted in this way
(Prol. 25, sqq). At that time the plays
were represented on 0 temporary platform
in the circus, where also gladiators and
shows of wild beasts were exhibited (000
Epp. 1. l. 6, n.). An amphitheatre for the
purpose of wild-beast shows was built for
the first time by Statilius Taurus in Α.11.0.
725 in the Campus Martius (Suet. Aug. 29).
Τ110 beasts were hunted by dogs or fought
by men. But though the acting of plays
was in Horace' 5 time carried on in atheatre
(v. 60, n.)erectedfor this special purpose,
it appears the people insisted sometimes 011
having a bear-hait or a boxing match there
to amuse them, in spite of the remon·
strances of the equites in the front rows,
who however, Horace sayS, were themselves
taken too much with prooessions and shows
that appealed more to the eye than to the
ear.

15. Jubae tellus] It 1133 been doubted
whether Horace nunde· to the elder or the
younger Juba. Orelli has printed in an
excursus an argument by one of his country·
11100 10 favour of the younger. lt seems, as
far as 1 030 understand it, to amount to
this,-—that the 3011 received at the hands of
Augustus, in place of his father’s kingdom
of Numidia, the whole of Mauritania, and
those of Gaetulia which lie contiguous
10 1110 range of Atlas. and that 111030 were
more productive of wild beasts 11130 Numi- ⁷
dia (the elder Juba’s kingdom), Gaetulian
lions being proverbial. But the extent of
the father' 3 dominion Horace was not
likely to desine more accurately than Lucan,
who says (iv. 670) it was the widoet in the
world. —

mon!

He was lord, says he, notonly os the Numi-
dian but of the Gaetulian, andy 3 11031 of other
tribes, all whichismereexaggeration. This
therefore proves nothing, and Horace might
very innocently have called the wholeg of
Libya ‘ Jubae tellus.’ even if the elder had
never had a son, or that son hadnever risen
in favour with Augustus. and been invested
with the kingdoms of Mauritania 31111 Gae-
tulia. It is not however improbable that
Horace, who notices the events of the day,
may have used the phrase in this instance
with reference to the honours newly grant-
ed to the younger Juba, who received the
grant of these parts of Libya A.u.c. 729.
Τ1113 would help to fix the date of the
ode.

16. Arida nutrit] Baxter entertains
his readers with the following note: ‘⁴ Fes-

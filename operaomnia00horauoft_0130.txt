Ο SAEPE fneeum tempus in ultimum

Quis te redonavit Quiritem

Cum quo morantem saepe diem mero

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam

1. tempus in ultimum] During the two
years between his leaving Rome and the
battle of Philippi, Brutus went through
many hard-fought battles with the native
tribes in Macedonia and in Asia Minor, as
well asin resisting the assumption of his pro-
vince by C. Antonius the triumvir’s brother,
to whom the Senate had assigned it. ⁴ Tem-
pus in ultimum’ does not mean so much to
the brink of the grave, as we should, say, as
into extreme danger or need. Forcell.
gives examples of this meaning of ⁴ tempus.’

3. redonavit Quiritem] This word‘redo—
nare' is peculiar to Horace. He uses it
again C. iii. 3. 33. It has been suggested
that Horace got Maecenas to intercede for
Pompeius’ pardon, 1 do not know on what
grounds. ⁴ Quiritem' has particular force
as ⁴ unshorn of your citizenship.’ He had
not been capite deminutus. The singular
⁴ Quiris’ does not occur in prose-writers.
Heinsius’ conjecture ‘ Quiritum' is weak
and insipid.

5. prime sodalium] It is probable that
the days Horace enjoyed so much with his
friend were spent at Athens. The language
does not seem to suit a camp life, especially
on such a service as the army of Brutus
went through. On ⁴ fregi’ see C. i. l. 20,
note.

8. Malobathro] Oil produced from an
Eastern shrub of that name. Graevius says
it came from the Malabar coast, and that
its native name was Tamalobatra. It must
in that case have been of the betel tribe.
But the betel has no smess, nor is any oil

extraeted from it. If this be an Indian
plant, ⁴ Syrio' is only usedjn the same ex-
tended application in which Ovid uses ⁴ As-
syrium' (Amor. ii. 5. 4o): ‘¹ Maeonis Assy-
rium foemina tinxit ebur.” See C. ii. 11.

9. Philippos et celerem suyam] We
need not take Horace too much at his
word. He was not born for a soldier any
more than his friend Iccius (C. i. 29); and·
he could afford to create a laug h against
himself as a ῥίψασπις. He hadg in mind
no doubt the misfortune that befel Alcaeus,
as related by Herodotus (v. 95). There
was nothingy disgraceful in the ssight stom
Philippi, which Brutus advised and neces-
sity compelled. Orelli interprete thus :—
⁴⁴ the boldest amongst ns bowed their heads
to the ground which their shame had dis-
graced, to ask for quarter,'' as Caesar de-
scribes Pompey’s soldiers doing after the
battle of Pharsalia (Bell. Civil. iii. 98).
Lambinus understands Horace to mean
that they bit the dust, as 'I'urnus says of
Mezentius (Aen. xi. 418): “Procubuit
moriens et humum semel ore momorditss'
and Ag. in his prayer against Hector (11. ii.
417): πολέες δ ἄμφ’ αὑτὸν ἑταῖροι Πρη-
νέες ἐν κοτ [yma ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο γαῖαν, and
Euripides of Eteocles and Polynices (Phoe-
niss. v. 1438). γαῖανδ” ὀδὰξ ἑλόντες α’λλή-
λοιν πέλας Πίπτουσιν ἄμφω. All that
seems to be meant is that the bold were
struck to the ground.

13. Mercurius celer Denso —- sustulit
aera] Poets were ⁴ Mercuriales viri' (C.

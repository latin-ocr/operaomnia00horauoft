EPISTLE X.

This Epistle is addraesed to Fuscus Aristius, whose name appears in C. i. 22; S. i. 9.
61; 10. 83. For such particulars as can be stated about him see the Introduction to the
above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him to a town life. He was making
money in some way, and he was associated with all Horace’s literary and other friends,
Horace praisos the steedom, the natural beautioe, and the healthinoes of the country, and
shows that they are natural to men's tastes from the attempta they make to get trees in
their town housos and a prospect over the fields. He follows this up with a few miscella-
neous remarks on the pun-suit of wealth, how it blinds the eyes to the distinction between
truth and falsehood, and how prosperity only makes adversity more hard to bear and dis-
appointment more bitter, and subjecta the mind to a gallidg slavery.

There is no clue to the date.

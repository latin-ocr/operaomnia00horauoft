dipem-um” at Crotona. He wrote in the reign of Tiberius.

Duentrer calls this Sotira “felicissima fictio.” Dacier thinks nothing could be more

noma· (Odyss- xi.) makes Ulysses go down to Hades and there meet Teii-osias the
Theb-n prophet, who tells him of the hardships that awaited him in his journey home,
whn'e however in the end he is destined to arrive. Horace supposes a continuation of the
ἱκανὴν, and makes Ulysses ask the soothsayer how he is to repair his fortunes when he
gete home, and finds his property wasted by his wife's suitcrs, as the prophet told him
it would be (see note on v. 6). Teircsias, though he implies that the cunning Ulysses

sqq. Ulysses appears in as low a character as he eam-an apt disciple‚ ready to be the
abadow of a slave, and to prostitute his chaste Penelope if need be. ΤΙιο Ulyssae of all
poem aster Homer is a contemptible personage, and it must be said in favour of Horace
thntl’enelope,whose character in the Odyssey is feminine and pure,isbylaterwriters
represented as less chaste than Homer has drawn her. These who only know her as the
virtuona wife and mother, will not easily forgive the coarse allusione to her in this Satire-
’ Smdon and Dader are anxious it should be understood, that when Ulysses appears to
acquiesce in the advice of the prophet, he hu no intention of demeaning himself so far as
fin sonavit: “il ae mtire apres la consultation sans repondre ἰ Tiresias, et sans declax-er
b parti {quoi il se determine ” (Sanadon). As it would be difficult to avoid condemning
flie whole construction of the Satire except by understanding it to be an exn-avagant
huiusque, we need not be at the trouble of detes-mining what the intentione of Ulyssoe

'nae mention of the Parthians (v. 62) once more raises up among the chronoloffists
the ghost of Crassus and the standards recovered in a.u.c. 734. The French editors
take it for granted the Sat-ire was written aster that event. Franke more probably places
the date before the battle of Actium, though he should have remembered C. i. 2. 41,

“ Sive mutata juvenem figura
Ales in terris imitaris?

where, by ‘juvenem,' Augustus is clearly meant (see note), before he came to the con-
clusion that aster the battle of Actium ‘⁴ poeta unicum rernm arbitrum vix juvenis nomine
insignivisset.” The above ode was written not earlim· than nanc. 725.

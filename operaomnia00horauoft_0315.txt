EPODON LIBER, 5.

Per liberos te, si vocata partubus
Lucina veris affuit,

Per hoc inane purpurae decus precor,
Per improbaturum haee J ovem,

Quid ut noverca me intueris aut uti
Petita ferro belua!

Ut haec trementi questus ore constitit
Insignibus raptis puer,

Impube corpus quale posset impia
Mollire Thracum pectora,

Canidia brevibus implicata viperis
Crines et incomptum caput

J ubet sepulcris caprificos erutas,
J ubet cupressus funebres,

Et uncta turpis ova ranae sanguine,
Plumamque nocturnae strigis,

Herbasque quas Iolcos atque Hiberia
Mittit venenorum ferax,

Et ossa ab ore rapta jejunae canis
Flammis aduri Colchicis.

At expedita Sagana per totam domum
Spargens Avernales aquas

Horret capillis, ut marinus asperis
Echinus aut currens aper.

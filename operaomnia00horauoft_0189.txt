Paene occupatam seditionibus
Delevit Urbem Dacus et Aethiops,

Hic classe formidatus, ille

Missilibus melior sagittis.
Fecunda culpae secula nuptias
Primum inquinavere et genus et domos;
Hoc fonte derivata clades

In patriam populumque fluxit.

Ἰωνικὸν 'Apu-{pult ὠρχοῦντο Σικελιῶται
μάλιστα (Pollux, quoted by Turnebus
Adv. iv. 21). Ῑιι the following line the
MSS. vary between ‘ fingitur artibus,’ ‘ fin-
gitur artubus,' snd ‘ frangitur artubus! The
fimt reading is (among others quoted by
Lambinus and Cruquius and Bentley) that
of Orelli's oldest Bernc and Ziirich MSS.
It is that of the Venetian copy of landinus
(1483), (except that ‘ fingitur ' is by a mis-
print ‘ figitur,') and hunbinus, Bentley, and
most modern editors have adopted it. ‘Arti-
bus' must be a very old reading, sor Porphy-
rion, who with the other Scholiasts preferred
‘ artubus,’ gives s note to cantion readers
against ‘ artibus! “Artubus legendum3 quis
non venit a nominativo artes sed artus.''

Postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit
Heu pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.

Setosa duris exuere pellibus

Laboriosi remiges Ulixei·

Volente Circa membra3

tunc mens et sonus

Relapsus atque notus in vultus honor.
Dedi satis superque poenarum tibi,

Amata nautis multum et institoribus.

Fugit juventas et verecundus color
Reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida ;
Tuis capillus albus est odoribus;
Nullum ab labore me reclinat otium;

Urget diem nox et dies noctem, neque est

25

Levare tenta spiritu praecordia.
Ergo negatum vincor ut credam miser
Sabella pectus increpare carmina

idle argument. Horace only makes them do
’ὠκέα-ευ the Greeks did for Patroclus (11. xviii.

Mur ἐλαίῳ. ‘Homicidam’ is a litei-al ver-
sion of ἀνδροφόνον, the well -lmown ep ithet
fin· Hector. The rhythm of the line in

{hich it occurs is without a precedent ιιι
m·

16. Laboriosi] This ep ithet is repeated
stom the last Epode (v. 60). ῐιι the next
verse most editors since Bentley have fol-
lowed his example, and given the Latin
rather than the Greek termination toCirce's
name. Bentley founds his adoption of this
form (which had before been so corrected by
Broukhusius on Propert. ii. 7. 18) on the
statement of Valerius Probus, whose au-
thority, as he justly says, is of great weight,
as being far anterior to any known MSS. of
Horace. Probus says (p. 1446)= “ ‘E '
nomina terminata Graeca sunt. ut Danae,
Euterpe, Circe, Agave. In genitivo ‘es‚'
in accusativo ‘en3’ hujus Danaes, hanc
Danaen. Ablativum enim, quia Graecum
est, non habent, et. convertuntur. Sic ex
‘e' litera ‘ a' facit et dicitur ⁴ cim: uude
est illud Horatii, ⁴ volente Circa! '' Bent-
ley adds, that in the Epodes, Satires, and
Epistles, Horace uses the Latin forms, and
in the Odes only the Greek, which might
be expected.

18. Rela psus] This is the reading of
most MSS. Three of the Berne have‘ re-
latus,' which is Lambinus’ reading and
Cruquius'. Bentley says the MSS. are apt
to vary between they compounds of‘ lapsus’
and‘ latus! Except the preponderance of

MSS. authority, 1 do not see much reason
for prefert-ing either to the other.

19. tibi, Amata] Bentley thinks that
by inserting‘ o' between these words the
sentence “quae prius languida et hiulca
erat novas viroe novamque juncturam ac-
quirit-st ΤΙιε quiet irony in the sentence
gives it its best force. 1 do not think
Bentley's expletive would add to it. “ Hoc
urbanissima contumelia dicit '³ (Porph.).
(Compare C. iii. 6. 30, ιι.) Bentley proposes
to change ‘ossa' to ‘ora,' quoting Julius
Scaliger: “Quis dicat colorem reliquisse
ossa? Non igitur debuit dicere ossa amicta
pelle sed reliquisse pellem amicientem
ossa ;” and adding, ‘¹ nihil hac censura jus-
tius clariusve dici potest ;'’ and going on to
prove that men’s bones do not blush, or if
they do it is a disease which has oecaped
the notice of the profession, aud more of
the same sort. The MSS. all agree, and
we may suppose the poor man to say that
he is nothing but skin and bone and hm
lost his colour. Whether Horace does not
sufficiently express this by the words as they
stand, plain men may judge. On v. 23 see
Introduction.

24. ab labore] This preposition is used
like ἀπὸ, ‘aster,'.aud ‘est’ in the next
verse like ἔστι for ἔξεστι.

28. Sabella] ΤΙιθ Sabine, Pelignim,
and Marsican women had credit above
others for witchcraflz. See S. i. 9. 29τ

“Namque instat fatum mihi triste, Sabella
Quod„ puero cecinit divina mota anus
urna.¹' Seebelow, v. 60, and Epod. v. 76.

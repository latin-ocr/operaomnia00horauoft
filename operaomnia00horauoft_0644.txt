number and neuter gender. See Lucret.

15. Ut cum pileolo soleas] The notion
here is of a person of humble station invited
to the table of a great man of his own tribe,
who perhaps wanted his vote and influence.
Having no slave to carry them for him, as
was usual, he comes with his cap and
slippers under his arm in an awkward
manner, not being accustomed tox the ways
of fine houses. ‘Pileus' was a skuu cap
made of felt and worn at night or in bad
weather. The man would bring it with
him to wear on his way home from the

dinner party. Τ110 ‘solea’ was the slipper
worn in the house as ‘calceus’ was the
walking shoe. (See S. i. 3. 127, n.)

16. Ne vulyo narres] ‘⁶ Don't tell it to
all the town that you are the bearet of
poems from Horace to Augustus, aad,

you to tell them your business, press on.”
Horace, by way of keeping up the joke‚
supposes his messenger to urive hot from

EPISTLE XIV.

Horace appears to have had a discontented ‘ villicus ' or steward of his property, whom
he had promoted to that post from having been originally one of the lower sort of slaves
in the town establishment. While in that position he sighed for what he thought must

be the superior freedom of the country ς but as soon as he had reached the highest place ·

he could be trusted with on the farm, he began to regret the former days when he could
get access to the tavern, and cookshop, and brothel, forgetting, as is common, the vexa-
tions that had made him long for deliverance before. This man's discontent suggested to
Horace this Epistle. It is such only in form, for we are not to suppose it was ever sent ω
the ‘ villicus.' Horace means to describe his own feelings in respect to the country, and
the change in his habits and character, and at the same timeto draw a moral from his
slave's conduct, as to the temper of those who never know what they want, who are
envious, discontented, and lazy.

There is no clue to the date.

120. (lb-'epm scrinia lippi] Crispinus
serves us ι deus ex machina, and helps
nom to bring his homily to sn end. But
we know nothing about him. The fertility
of his pen, ss Esne observes, has profited
him nothing. He was more anxious to
write mueh than to write well.

“Crispinus minimo me provocat: accipe,

Agge tubulas· detur nobis locus,

Custodhomeu videamus uter plus scibam

pomtss' (S.i.>4.14,sqq.)

The Scholissts ssy he was called ‘aretalo-
gus,' aud that he wrote verses on the Stoic
doctrines. The word ⁴ aretalogus ’ occurs
in J uveml (S. xv. 16 ε “ mendax aretalo-

gus''), and in Sueton- (Octuv. c. 74), where
Cmubou hus this note : ‘⁶ vox est Romae
nata x et ni fallor Crispino illi primum
attributa haec appellatio? Suetonius intro·-

dnoea these‘ aretalogi 'gelon with the lower
sort of uecors, und it appears gthat they were
naortofjoetor, whoaffectedtodiscourse
upon the Stoic doen-ines of virtue, und made
mirth for the rich. They were kept by the
weelthy to muse them ss the court fools of

later day s. In this character Crispinus
appears in the third Satire of this book(v.

139), where heis the only attendunt of the
would· be‘ rex! Crisp inus appears again
in S. ii. 7. 45. ΤΙιει1;Ρ he moy have been
called in contempt ‘'aremlogus is not
impossible. Thst he was actually s person
of that grado is not likely. 'rhet he wrote
ss ι Stoic may be true, but it is only
gnthered probably from this passage, riches
being sfuvourite topic with the philosophers
os that sect. Bentley cannot endure the
reading of ull the MSS„ Scholiasts, and edi-
tions, ⁴ lippi! Horace (says he) was himself
afflicted with sore eyes, uid he was not so
wanting in deoency as to ridicule mother
person for that defect. This ent
against all authority is not worth discussing.

twice for the mental blindness which, ns
Cruquius’ Commentator says, is what Ho-
race means to charge upon Crispinus. See
Pers. (S. i. 79): “Hos pueris monitus
pau-es infundere lippos.” And S. v. 77:
“Vuppa et lippus, et in tenui farragine
ssendaxss' Persius was ιιιι imintor of

oraoe.

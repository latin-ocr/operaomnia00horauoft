. HORATII FLACCI ·

Quae priscis memorata Catonibus atque Cethegis
Nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas ;
Adsciscet nova quae genitor produxerit usus.

Vehemens et liquidus puroque simillimus amni

120

Fundet opes Latiumque beabit divite lingua3
Luxuriantia compescet, nimis aspera sano
Levabit cultu, virtute carentia tollet,
Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut qui

Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem Cyclopa movetur.

125

Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,
Dum mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,

Quam sapere et ringi.

117. Catonibus atque Cetheqis] Asto
the use of the plural number see note on
S. i. 7. 8. Μ. Porcius Cato Censorius was
born about ΛΑΜ). 520, and was therefore
contemporary with Ennius, with whom
he is associated A. P. 56 as successfully
importing new words into the language.
Fragments remain of his treatise de Re
Rustica, embracing a variety of instructions
on husbandry and subjects connected with
domestic economy; and of his Origines,
an account of the early history of Italy.
Tbere are also fragments of his orations,
which Cicero appears to have studied (Bru-
tus, c. 17). He had the highest opinion of
Cato, aud complains that he was not studied
enough even in his day, adding “refertae
sunt orationes et verbis et rebus illustri-
bus—omnes oratoriae virtutes in eis reperi-
entur. Jam vero Origines ejus quem florem
aut quod lumen eloquentiae non habent ?''
M. Cornelius Cethegus was older than Cato,
since he was curule aedile when Cato was
no more than twenty. His eloquence was such
that Ennius called Cethegus ‘⁴ Suadae me-
dulla, orator suaviloquenti ore '' (Cic. Brut.
c. 153 Cat. Maj.e. 143 see Epp. i. 6. 36, n.).
But it does not appear that any of his
orations were extant in Cicero’s time, for
he only mentions them on the authority of
Ennius who had heard him speak. His
reputation was sufficient at the time Horace
wrote sor him to name him twice as an
authority on the language (see A. P. 50, n.).

119. quae yenitor produoeerit usus]
⁴ Usus' is ‘cust0m,’ which has always
been the parent of novelties in language.
Compare A. P. 70, sqq.:

“Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere,
cadentque

Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula si
volet usus,

Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,

Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma
loquendi! ¹

120. Vehemens] The two first syllables
are pronounced as one. Compare S. i. 5.
67 z ‘⁴ Nihilo deterius dominae jus esse.”

123. virtute carentia tollet‚] Diuenb.
and Orelli interpret ‘tollet' as ‘extollet,'
like Quintilian’s ‘⁴ premere tumentia, hu-
milia extollere’' (x. 4. l); and Cicero (de
Orat. iii. 26); “ Summa laus eloquentiae
est amplificare rem ornando, quod valet non
solum ad augendum aliquid et tollendum
altius dicendo, sed etiam ad extenuandum
et abjiciendum.’' In these passages there
could be no ambiguity in the word. In the
text I think if Horace had meant what fliese
commentators suppose, he would have ex-
pressed it more plainly. 1 believe the
words mean ‘ he will remove what lacks
merit.' He will work hard to produce a
result which shall appear playful and easy,
the turns being as easy as those of the
⁴ mimus,’ who dances either the light mea-
sure of the nimble Satyr or the clumsy

dance of the Cyclops (on which see S. i. 5. ἰ

63, n.). The words have some difficulty, bnt
I believe this to be the meaning. The
poet‘s art is to conceal his art, and to make
that appear easy which has cos¹t him a good
deal of trouble.

126. Praetulerim scriptor] This is sup-
posed to be the remark of one who would
be a poet without the necessary trouble.
He would rather be pleased with his own

bad verses, even though he might be de- ¹ V*

ceiving himself, than be so learned and be
perpetually vexed with himself. ⁴ Ringere’
is properly applied to the grinning of a dog
when it snarls.

128. Fuit haud iqnobilis timim] sir
Henry Halford furnishes a parallel story
(Essays, p. 61): “One case, that of the gen-

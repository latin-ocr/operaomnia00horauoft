HORATII FLAGGI

Si quia Graecorum sunt antiquissima quaeque
Scripta vel optima Romani pensantur eadem

Scriptores trutina, non est quod multa loquamur:

30

Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri;
Venimus ad summum fortunae; pingimus atque
Psallimus et luctamur Achivis doctius unctis.
Si meliora dies ut vina poemata reddit,

Scire velim chartis pretium quotus arroget annus.

35

Scriptor abhinc annos centum qui decidit inter
Perfectos veteresque referri debet, an inter

Viles atque novos ἓ

Excludat jurgia finis.

Est vetus atque probus centum qui perficit annos.

Quid, qui deperiit minor uno mense vel anno,

40

Inter quos referendus erit? veteresne poe'taS,
An quos et praesens et postera respuat aetas?
Iste quidem veteres inter ponetur honeste

Qui vel mense brevi vel toto est junior anno.

Utor permisso caudaeque pilos ut equinae

45

Paulatim vello et demo unum, demo et item unum,
Dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi

on the Alban Mount Horace means Egeria,
who was counted a tenth Muse. But Ι
think with Orelli he had no such meaning.

29. pensantur eadem Scriptores trutina ‚]
See S. i. 3. 72, n.

31. Nil intra eet oleam,] This may be
a proverb. Its meaning it is not difficult
to see. ⁴ If we are to believe that as the
oldest poets of Greece (Homer at the head
of them) ‚are the best, therefore Roman
poets must be judged by the same rule,
there is no use in talking; we are to believe
any absurdity, to disbelieve our eyes, and
deny the most palpable truths3 the olive
is hard without and the nut is soft; we
may congratulate ourselves; of course our
painters, our musicians, our athletes, are
better than those of Greecess which every
one knows' is not the case.

35. quotus arroqet annua] See C. iv. 14.
40,n. Horace uses ‘decidere' (v. 36) in the
same sense in C. iv. 7. 14.

45. caudaeque pilos ut equinae] When
the soldiers of Sertorius insisted on attack-
ing the enemy against his wish‚ and were
beaten, he took the following means of
showing them their error and the policy he
chose to pur-sue. He put before them two

horses, one old and infirm, the other young
and fresh with a remarkably fine tail. A

strong man stood by the old horse, a small
man by the young one. They were- desired
to pull the hair out of the tails of the
animale, and the strong man pulled at his
with great force, while the little man pro-
ceeded to pull out the hairs of the other one
by one. The weak man soon accomplished
his work, while the strong man of course
failed. (Plutarch, vit. Sert. c. 16.) Ho-
race appears to refer to this story, which
was probably well known. The application
here is plain, though it has no very close
analogy to the original.

46. demo et item] ‘ Etinm' is the read-
ing of all the old editions and of some
modern (Doering among others). Bentley,
on the authority of several MSS, since

confirmed by others, including two of the ,

oldest Parisian, introduced ‘et item,' as
being less likely to have been invented than
‘ etiam! He quotes Terence, Andria (i. l.

ο 6
ggilicens Unus et item alter ;’'
(iv. 553):

⁴ ‘ Asperitas autem vocis fit ab asperitate
Prin⁰{flir⁰f›¹²m' et item levor levore crea-

and Lucretius

47. ratione ruentis acervi] This seems ⁷

to be an allusion to what Cicero (de Divinae.

‘ Sed postquam amans accessit pretium J

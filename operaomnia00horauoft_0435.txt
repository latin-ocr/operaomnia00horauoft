'l'he parsimouious Natta, who robbed the
lampa to oil himself, was probably a person
of good family, that being the cognomen
'of the Pinaria genS. one of the oldest
patrician families in Rome.

125. Aet ubi mesenum] When the sun
began teget hot about noon, and Horace
wastired with his ga‚me hewent to the

public baths to bathe? whichwas usual aster

playing, and then took a light luncheon

aee
inunge-1 at home till evening, when he went
outforhis ΜΠ per-,hapa and oeme home
apin to his supper, as he told us before.
Iu v. 126 there has been made a more
violent change in the text than any other
flant the editors of Horace have ventured
upon. From the earliest of the Scholiasts
flu Bentley the received reading was “ fugio
rabiosi tempora signi,” which Acron ex·
plains “aestuosos dies caniculares ;'' Cru-
qm'us’ commentator and Porphyrion the
same. It would have been better if they
had explained it of the noonday sun. But
'us observes in his Commentary that
the oldest of his Blandinian MSS. had
“fugio Campum lusumque trigonem,'’ but
with marks of a doubtful reading under-
neath, and the received words in the margin.
Bentley, seized with his usual avidity upon
thisreading,‘ ‘Aut enim egregie fallor, aut
aa sola sincera lectio est, et Venusina lu-
digna? With one exception it has
beeu received into the text by every subse-
quent editor whose edition 1 have seen.

v Dillenbr. rejects it, and calls the old read-

ing· ‘unice vera lectio.” 1 cannot myself
’ aee the grounds upon which the new read-
ing has been so unhesitatingly adopted. lf
the other be weak, as 1 think it is, and this
somewhat more to the purpose, that may
only prove it to be a more ingenious inter-
ffllation than the other, supposing both to
invented by the copyists, which is not
nnlikely. F. V. Fritzsche (in Aristoph.
Thcam. p. 13), quoted by Wiistemann in

above, S. 5. 25. n.), aster-which he·

his edition of Heindorf's Nous, and by
Orelli in his excursus on this passage, says
that Mavortius, the editor from whom we
are said to have derived the received text οἵ
Horace, found an hiatus aster ‘gifu o' in
his copies, and absurdly filled it up with
the words ‘rabiosi tempora signi. ’ But
why the copyist of the Blandinian MS.
found no hiatus, and was guilty of no inter-
polation, the nme scholar does not say. 1
have followed the judgment of such scholars
as Gesner, Doering, Heindorf, Fea, Orelli,
in receiving the new reading, which is un-
doubtedly neater than the other, but without
much saith in the verse having been so
written by Horace. ‘Lusum trigonem’
:rats emtas-2⁸¹¹ ξιξ semesa

name impliea, were three in number, and .

stood in a triangle. Their skill appears to
have been shown in thr-owing
the ball with the lest hand:

⁴· Sic palmam tibi de trigone nudo
Unctae det favor arbiter coronae ;
Nec laudet Polybi magis sinistras.”
(Mart. m. 72.)

and catching

An unskilful player is represented as catch-

{plg {hg ball with the right hand as well as
e e ε

“ Captabit tepidum dextra laevaque trigonem
Imputet exceptas ut tibi saepe pilas.”
(Ibid. xii. 83.)
Dillenbr. doubts whether this game was
known in Horace¹s day. It is no where
mentioned earlier than Martiah and 1 am
surprised that Becker, fi-om whom (Gallus,
Exest on the Games ⁹) the above account is
taken, does not refer to this passage of
Horace. From the above passage of
MartiaL Bentley proposes to read ⁴ nudum,'
thereby (for the sake, ω usual, of a mere
verbal correspondence between passages that
have no connexion) weakening the slender
authority on which his emendation rests.
127. quantum interpellet] As much as
would prevent me from going all day on an
empty stomach. The prose construction

would be‘ interpellet quin,' or‘ quominusss
or‘ ne durem!

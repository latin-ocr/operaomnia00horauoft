40 HORATII FLAGOI

Nuper sollicitum quae mihi taedium,
Nune desiderium curaque non levis,

‘ debes laudibrium ' for the Greek ὀφλι-
σκάνεις γέλωτα. I do not see how ‘nisi
debes ’ can stand for ‘ ne debeas,’ and agree
rather with Dillenbr. See Argument.

17. Nuper sollicitum] This is the most
obscure part of the ode. It would be very
intelligible as spoken by Alcaeus, who having
gone through the long and anxious struggle
between the democratical party and the
nobles, and seen the triumph of the former,
and the settlement of a tyranny which he

sort in Alcaeus' ode. How the words are re-
conciled with Buttmann’s theory will be
seen by referring tothe Introduction. Taking
the ode as an address to the state we ean
only understand Horace to mean, thet while
he was attached to Brutus, or before he had
secured his pardon, he had no other feel-
ings than fear for his own safety and disguet
with the state of the country, but now
under Augustus he watches its fate with
the affection and anxiety of a friend.

CARMEN XV.

This is probably an early composition of Horace made up of materiale from the Greek,
and written merely to exercise his pen. The Scholiasts found a politieal allusion in the

ode : Paris being M. Antonius, and Helen Cleopatr-223 and Baxter, ὁ διλογὶστης, has seizetl ’

upon the notion, which others also have adopted. The judicious readerwill see that
there is no probability of such being the drift of the ode. Nereus is made to speak be-
cause the sea-gods were endowed 'with the gift of prophecy. Porphyrion on this ode says
it is an imitation of Bacchylides, who makes Cassandra foretel the destruction of Troy
as Horace does Nereus. There is a fragment (29 Bergk) which is supposed to belong to
the poem referred ,to by this Scholiast, but it bears no resemblance to Horace's ode.

ARGUMENT'.

Paris is carrying off Helen, when Nereus causes a calm and thus prophesies their fate.
With dark omen art thou carrying home her whom Greeoe hath swom to recover-
Alas! for the sweating of horse and rider, and the deaths thou art bringing upon Troy.
Pallas prepareth her arms and her fury. Under Venus' shelter oomb thy looks and
strike thy lyre, and hide thyself in thy chamber z but it shall not avail thee. ,Seest thou
not Laertes' son, Nestor of Pylos, Teucer of Salamis, aud Sthenelus the fighter and
bold charioteer? Merion too and the son of Tydeus, from whom thou shalt fiee panting
as the stag fleeth from the wolf, thou who didst boast better things to thy ffir- one.

Achilles’ wrath may put off the evil day, but the fire of the Greek shall consume the
homes of Troy.

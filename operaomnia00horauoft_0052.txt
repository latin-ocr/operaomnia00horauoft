22 HORATII FLAOGI

It has been conjectured with probability that this ode was written soon after the battle
of Actium, when Agrippa’s glory was at its height. It would seem that the general had
asked Horace to write an ode in his honour-3 but he had the good sense to declines, task
which he might not have executed satisfactorily to the great man or himself: at the same
time he declined in the most graceful way by intimating that Agrippa deserved an Epic
rather than an ode, and the pen of Varius rather than of Horace.

ARGUMENT.

Varius, shall sing in Homeric strain of thy victories by sea and land. My humble muse μ

dares not sing of these, of the wrath of Achilles, or the wanderings of Ulysses, or the

fate of Pelops' house, nor will she disparage thy glories and Caesar’s. Who can fitly
sing of Mars mail-clad, of Meriones black with the dust of Troy, of Diomed a match
for gods ? Ι sing but of feasts and of the battles of boys and girls.

Scmmzms Vario fortis et hostium

Victor Maeonii carminis alite,

Quam rem cunque ferox navibus aut equis
Miles te duce gesserit:

N os, Agrippa, neque haec dicere nec gravem 5

Pelidae stomachum cedere nescii

Nec cursus duplicis per mare Ulixei
Nec saevam Pelopis domum

2. carminis alite‚] ‘Alite’ is in appo-
sition with Vario. Because in prose the
ablative of the agent without a preposition
is not admissible,‘ alite,’ which' is the read-
ing of all the MSS., has been altered to
‘ aliti! But Horace has the same >construe
tion Epp. i. 1. 94: “Curatus inaequali
tonsore.” S. ii. 1. 84: “Laudatus Cae-
sare.'' C. iii. 5. 24: “Marte populata
nostro.’' Orelli’s note about the ablative
absolute would not explain one in ten of
the instances in which this poetical con-
struction occurs. It is most frequently
found in Ovid. The Scholiasts Acron and
Comm. Cruq. finding ‘alite,’ and not con-
necting it with‘Va1·io‚² rendered it as if it
were ‘under the auspices of Homeric verse‚'
and they have found some followers3 but
it is unnecessary to reply to them.

3. Quam rem cunque] The construction
is by atti-action. The full expression would
be‘ scriberis et scribetur omnis res quam-
cunque.' Muretus’ reading is ‘ qua rem cun-
que’ for ‘wherever,’ which Bentley adopts
in his text with a great deal of his own sort
of argument, which brings no conviction to
plain minds. The MSS. do not vary. Bent-
ley calls to his assistance, as‘ vir eruditusss
one whose cumbrous pedantry he would
have been the first to discover, had he not
found occasion to agree with him, Walter

Chabot, whose ponderous commentary Ι

have attempted to make use of in vain. , j

Agrippa’s great successes up to this time
had been ιιι the Perusian war (in which ha
had the principal command under Augus-
tus) ιιι Gaul aud Germany, by laud3 and
against Sex. Pompey andy at Actium, by

sea.- Te duce' is used advisedly, as the
‘auspicium 'belonged only to Augustus.

5. neque Ilaec—nec yravem] This ιε ω
if he had said: ‘ I should not think of
singing of these victories any more than I
should of the wrath of Achilles! Compare
C. iii. 5. 27—30:

Lana refert medicata fuco,
Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit
Curat reponi deterioribus.”

‘As the stained wool does not recover- its
lost colour, so true virtue once lost-will not
be replaced by the haser sort.’ ‘Gravem
stomachum ¹ is plainly a translation of
μῆνιν οὐλομένην, and ¹ cedere nescii ' is ex-
plained by ‘inexorabilis,' A. P. 121. ,This

construction with ⁴ nescius ' is not uncom- ⁷ ’

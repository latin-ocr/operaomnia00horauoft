EPISTLE XIX.

It would appear that Horace had imitators among those who abused him; and if we
are to understand him to mean what he says, there were those who took his convivial
odes literally, and, coupling them‘with the example of the old Greek poets, conceived
that the way to write verses was to propitiate Bacchus and drink a great deal of wine.
But perhaps he only means that they took to writing in the same strai‘n all about wine
and driving dull care away, and so forth, which at second hand would be very poor staff.
Such servile imitators he speaks of with great disgust3 and, while he exposes their
shallowness, he accounts for their malevolence towards himself by the fact of his not
having sought their company or hired their applause. He at the same time claims to
have been the first to dress the lyric measures in the Latin language‚ while he defends
himself for having adopted the metres of another by pointing to the examples of Sappho
and Alcaeus, and takes credit for having avoided the virulence of Archilochus while he
imitated his verse. This is introduced by the way, the chief purpose of the Epistle being
to show the folly of his calumniators and the cause of their abuse.

There* 1s no allusion to any of his poeuis but the Epodes and Odes· ‚ the publication
of the latter probably brought out the imitations and the abuse referred to, and 1 think
it probable that this Epistle was written at no great distance of time after that publica-
tion. Franke gives A.u.c. 734 for the date. I should be inclined for the above reason
to put it a year or two earlier.

Cratinus tells us, Maecenas, that no water drinker can write good verses. Ever since
Liber took them into his choir the Muses have taken to drinking. Homer would not

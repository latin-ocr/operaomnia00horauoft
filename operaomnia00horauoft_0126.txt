96 HORATII FLAGCI

J am te sequetur: currit enim ferox
Aetas et illi quos tibi dempserit
Apponet annos; jam proterva 15 ¹
Fronte petet Lalage maritum ε
Dilecta quantum non Pholoe fugax,
Non Chloris albo sic humero nitens, -
Ut pura nocturno renidet

Mire sagaces falleret hospites
Discrimen obscurum solutis
Crinibus ambiguoque vultu.

meaning as can be. It is true that Horace
does not mean it in the same sense as Jason
meant when he proposed to give up his own
life to prolong his father's (Met. vii. 168):
‘⁴ Deme meis anuis et demptos adde parenti ;”
but he means ‘ she will approach the flower
of her age as you recede from it ;’ and ex-
presses it thus, ‘ her years will become more
numerous as the remainder of your time
becomes shorter! The Scholiasts take this
view of the passage· “pro viribus et aetatis
flore ponit annos; quae jam per senium mi-

nuerentur, illi 8113818111ιι1”(Α81011).Τ118

Bentley destroys his own argument by pro-
posing‘ quot’ for‘ quos’ in 8888 the other
suggestion be not accepted.

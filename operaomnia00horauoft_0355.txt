SATIRARUM Ι. 1.

Qm fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem

Seu ratio dederit seu fors objecerit illa

Contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentes?

“ Ο fortunati mercatores !'' gravis annis

Miles ait multo jam fractus membra. labore. 5
Contra mercator, navem jactantibus Austris:

“ Militia est potior.

i. 9. 1⁴, osto‘ oors' ond ‘fors.’ Tbesetwo
ore opposed 88 effect and cause, the condi·
tion ond that which produces it. ‘Fors'
and ‘rofio’ oreopposed os occident ond
denum—that which o man cannot help,
and thot which he curves out for himself.

combination with, and as equivalent to,
‘probum' Heindorf quotes two placoe in

says, ” Ex quo illorum beata mors videtur,
horum vito laudabilis.”

laudet diversa sequentes f] Thisisbriefly
expressed ior ⁴ 8811 quisque laudet,’ as Hein-
dorf remarks. Τ118 irregularity is almost
imperceptible3 the absence of 8 nominative
is 80 little felt in such-a position that any
language will allow of its omission.
Plato (Rep. ii. p. 366, n): τῶν γε ἄλλων
οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν δίκαιος ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ ἀνανδρίας-
*Pi-yn τὸ ἀδικεῖν ἀδυνατῶν αὐτὸ δρᾶν.
cie. de Or. ii. 14: “Nemo extulit eum
verbis qui 118 dixisset, ut qui adessent iu-
telligerent quid dixisset, sed contempsit eum
qui minus id facere potuisset.” In the
tronsition 110111 negative to positive stote·
ments, the positive element which is con-
tained in the former is osten carried on in
the mind so 88 to offect the latter, 88 111
those sentences which are coupled by ¹ nec'
and ‘,et' οὔτε 81111 τε. ‘Nemo vivit' is

‘quisque non vivit! E‘very one must be
consdous of thisin the language of common

adopting, with Orelli, Jahn’s limitation,
‘⁴ Significat poeta non annos 11188 8811 8111108
1111111188.” Virgil says (Aen. ix. 246):⁴ ’1118

And· grovis’ is one of the commonest
words applied to old 838, 88 ony one knows
who hosp read Cicero' s treotise; ond βαρύς
18 equally common in the same connexion.
That Angustus' ooldiers got their discharge
before they were fifty is nothing to the
{muvssfflzffinffffi :⁷3:¹3
ofpeeceond ease. Horace, in 1118 own
88111 “ ‘ ,hod heard monyavetoeanno
doubt grumbling ot his conditionz ond if he
wrote ‘annis‚’ 118 11188111 838, not service.
Lucan puts such complaints into the lips of
Julius emm-’s soldiers (v. 273, sqq.): ·
Finis quis quaeritur armis ἓ
Quid satis est, si Roma parum? jam
Inffizzn 1111111118, et inanes cerne 18-

certos.
Usus abest vitae: bellis consumpdmns

aevum.'’

 

‘Armis’ is 8 conjectu-al reading which
some editors 11818 adopted, and Heindorf
says it 18 specious (schmeichelend), but it 18
1101 general enough to be admitted, ond the
MSS. are unanimously against it.

See inserted the usual note of interrogation

after‘ enim! ‘Quid' and‘ qnid enim' ore

each used 88 introductory to something that
1118808188,οτ explains, or accounts for what
has just been said. They introduce 811
example, or they carry ou the flow of on
arguinent, or something of that sort. It 18
1101 difficult to see how that conventionol
sense may have become connected with the
word‘ quid,y but to explain it by an ellipse,
as‘ ‘quid est enim 1111011 contradici queat?
nonne concurritur. >' ¹(Heindorf‚ ) and so to
point the words 88 10 indicate that meaning,
even if thot explanation were correct, which
1 doubt, is no more desis-able than to break
up any other sentence and reduce it to its

possible elements. Any 1811311838 would be

HORATII FLAOOI

Haec seges ingratos tulit et feret omnibus annis.
Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus,
Nec tamen ignorat quid distent aera lupinis ε
Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.

Quodsi me noles usquam discedere, reddes

Forte latus, nigros angusta fronte capillos,
Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere decorum et
Inter vina fugam Cinarae maerere protervae.
Forte per angustam tenuis vulpecula rimam

16. Beniyne] This is a polite way of
declining the offer. ⁴¹ You are very good,’'
the refusal being expressed in action (see
below, v. 62). It might mean accept-
ance, just as the French say ⁴ merci,’ mean-
ing ‘yes' or ⁴no,’ according to circum-
stances. In Shakspeare’s Merry Wives
of Windsor (Act i. Sc. l), Anne Page
says to Slender, ‘⁴ Wilt please your wor-
ship to come in, Sir?'’ And he answers,
bashfully, ⁴⁴ I thank you forsooth, heartily;
1 am very well.’'—Anne. “ Ι may not go in
without your worship ι they will not sit till
you come.'’-Slender. ⁴⁴ 1‘ saith I'll eat no-
thing: 1 thank you as much as though 1
did ” (⁴⁴ Tam teneor dono, quam si dimittar
onustus’'). A very similar scene occurs
between the maid servant and Xanthias in
Aristophanes (Ran. 503, sqq.), when, to
her earnest invitation to come in and eat os
her dainties, he answers sheepishly, κάλ-
λιστ’, ἐπαινῶ-πάνυ καλῶς. There is
none of this silliness here however, but the
conversational idiom is the same. (See
Cicero in Verr. ii. 3. 85, Long’s note.)

22. diq nis ait ease pamma] Several
examp 1039 of this sort of attraction are given
in Key’ s L. G. 1060. Orelli has collected
more on this place. See also C. iii. 16. 32,
n., and C. 111. 27. 73, “Uxor invicti Jovis
esse nescis) ‘Dignis' is masculine· heis
ready to serve those who are worthy, but he
is no simpleton3 he knows the difference
between true money and counterfeit. This
kind of bean was used for counters or sham
money 08 the stage;⁴ ‘comicum aurum’
83 it is called in Plautus (Poen. iii. 2. 20).

25. Diynum praestabo me] Horace
means to say he will endeavour to show

himself worthy (referring tn ‘ dignis ’ above)
in proportion to the excellence of 11118
(Maecenas) who has laid him under such
obligations. He say s in effect that Maecenas
does not bestow his liberality stupidi„ aa
one who gave his friends what he was just u
readyto throwto thep pigs, or thefoolvho

does not know the value of 1113 gista. He ⁷ >

only gave to the worthy y, and such Horace
would try to prove himself. ’

26. anyueta fronte] See C. i. 35. ὅ, n.

27. Reddes dulce loqui,] A similar in-
stance, illustrating the nature of the infini-
tive 83 8 neuter substantive, occurs above
(S. ii. 7. 43), “Aufer Me vultu threno?
See Key’s L. G. 1232, sqq. :-“ In the
Greek language this is so completely tha
case that the article may be fio
itinall its 08303 Τ110 English 8130 nent
their infinitive as a submritive when thoy

place before it the preposition‘ to.’ ”-

28. Cinarae] SeeC. iv. 1. 4, n.

29. vulpecula] Bentley has a faceh‘ffl
note upon this, in which beappo-leto
huntsmen, countrymen, aud 8818181818]οω-
phers, against such a monstrous notion aa·
fox eating 0018.Ηο proves that they have
neither teeth to grind nor a 3101118011 to
digest it. But the reader must 80 to his
note, “quam legisse 11011 poenitebia' ' say!
ForceUini, 1 hardly know why. lt repre-
sents to me nothing but the arrogance of
the author. He proposes, out of his own
head, ‘nitedulal a ⁴-field mouse,' without
attempting to explain how this word has
disappeared from every MS„ and 10 have
been met with in no &sedition till his own.

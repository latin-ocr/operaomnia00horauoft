Auctore Phoebo ter pereat meis
Excisus Argivis, ter uxor
Capta virum puerosque ploret.
Non hoc jocosae conveniet lyrae:

Quo, Musa, tendis?

Desine pervicax

Referre sermones deorum et
Magna modis tenuare parvis.

he applies the same remark to onus,'
‘Jonustum ‘'lam-uma (which he spells‘ la-

like to change ‘'auctore into ‘structore’
but would not object to ‘ ἀποῦσι-ιι,’ because
Horace says elsewhere,

Alite muros ;’'

and Virgil says (Aen. i. 423), ‘ pars ducere
muros! Bentley's morbid desire to change
the received text as osten as he could comes
out in this case. Horace might asproperly
say ‘auctore Phoeboss as Virgil ‘'Iffoiae
Cynthius auctor’ (G. iii. 36).

About A. U.c. 728.

Pursuing his purpose, Horace here commenda the power of wisdom and learning in
subdning brute force and violent passions. If A.t5.c. 728 be the year in which Horace
met with his accident (C. ii. 13), this ode could not have been written before that year,

The expedition intended for BrItain, but

med against Spain, took place that year, and seems to Franke to be alluded to in the
ninth sunm. A Parthian expedition was in contemplation at the same time. The allu-
sions to violent men unrestrained by the Muses appear to the same writer to have refer-
ence to Cornelius Gallus and M. Equatius Rufus, both disaffected men, the former of
whom destroyed himself, and the latter conspired against Augustus' life, both in the above
year (Dion. Cass. liii. 23, 24). This may οι· may not be true, but it is consistent with

the nofion, which some chronologies are not, that all these six odes were written about the

HORATII FLAOGI

or hurt3 but they had come from all
quarters, and this is no indication of the
population. Suetonius (Tib. 40) makes the
number upwards of 20,000.

These two towns were proverbially joined
together, for besides this place we find in

Juvenal (S. x. 99),-

“ Hujus· qui trahitur praetextam sumere
mmss{d}’nmm Gabiorumque esse potes-
tas .

that is, a magistrate of the little towns of
Fidenae and Gabii; and S. vi. 55 :--

“ Mag-na tamen fama est cujusdam rure
Viveliissiselingivat Gabiis, ut vixit in agro 3
Vivat Fidenis, et agello cedo paterno.”

virgil mentions them together as colonies of
Alba (Aen. vi. 773) 2—-

“ Hi tibi Nomentum, et Gabios, urbemque

Fidenam,
Hi Collatinas imponent montibus arces ;'’

where it may be observed virgil shortens
the first syllable, whereas Horace and
Juvenal and Silius (xv. 91) make it long.
8. tamen illic vivere vellem] There is
a good deal of difficulty in respect to the
connexion and meaning of this passage and
the next. Horace seems to mean that
though Lebedus was a place deserted, he
could enjoy living there though it cut him
off from all his friends for the sake of the
fine prospect it gave of the sea, which
would be an exaggerated way of speaking.
He had probably in mind some occasion
when he had admired the sea from Lebedus,
and the recollection came upon him strongly
as he wrote; or Bullatius may have said
something in a letter about the fine pro-
spect. and Horace means that he agrees
with him. But, he goes on to say, there is
a time for all things. The traveller, when
he gets splashed, may be glad of a tavern
to retire to and clean himself, but he would
not wish to stay there 811 his life ς and the
man who has got chilled may be glad of a
fire or hot bath, but he does not reckon
fires and hot baths the chief good of life3
and though you may have been glad to get

on shore in a foreign land to escape from a
storm, youwill surely not think it necessary
to stay there for ever. 11· a man is in
health, Rhodes and Mytilene are not the
placesfor him3 so comeback againwhile
you may, and if you must praise those danunt
parts, praise them at home. It appears ιι
if Bullatius had been a good while absent
and meant to remain much longer.

ll. qui Capua Romam] The road Ap-
pius made (A.u.c. 442) extended only as
far as Capua, It was asterwards extended
to Beneventum, and theu on by two diffo-
rent branches to Brundusium, according to
the general opinion, which however has
been disputed (see S. i. 5. 79, 8.). The
road, of which a description is given by
Procopius (de Bell. Goth. i. 14 from his
own observations, was formed o blocks of
basaltic stone very compaetly put together
without mortar or clamps, or metal of any
sort. Whether there was originally gravel
laid over the pavement or not is uncertain3
but when it came to be worn by traffic, a
coat of gravel may have been given it.
Certainly gravel is mentioned in the in-
scription quoted on S. i. 5. 6, and Horaoe's
account of the traveller coming in splaahed
with mud leads to the same conclusion.
The pavement is now generally covered with
gravel, and “ when it is annover-ed, as at
capo de Bove, at Fondi, δια, the stenes,
though irregular² are large and flat, but
their edges being worn into hollows
jolt a carriage unmercifully” (Forsyth's
Italy, p. 133). This confirma the inter-
pretation given to the verse last referred to.

12. nec qui Friyus colleqit] This pas·
sage is not given by Forcellini under ‘col-

1igere,' and, as far as I can gather, it stands ·

alone. The meaning is plain enough': he
who has got chilled, not he who has caught
the agne, as some say. Obbarius quotes
Ovid (Met. i. 234): ‘⁸ ab ipso Colligit os
rabiem.” ¹ Furnos ’ may be bakers’ oveas
or any furnaces to which a 'man might go
to warm himself. As to the ‘balneae
‘public baths,' the subject is too wide for
this place, and all information that is
wanted can be gathered from the Dict.

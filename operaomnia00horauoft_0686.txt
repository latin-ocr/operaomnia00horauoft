656 HORATII FLAGGI

are common ς but the fact is it has more difficulty because it has less indulgence. Don't
you see how elever Plautus is in rakish youths, stingy fathers, tricksy bawds ἓ. How
great is Dossennus in parasites, and how slip-shod he walks over the stage? All he
cares for is to put money in his purse; while those who take to writing for fame riso
and fall with the mere caprice of the spectator. Farewell the stage for me, if applause
is to make me fat and the refusal of it lean. The boldest poet is sometimes discon-
certed when the mob in the middle of the play call for bears and boxers. And even
the educated have turned to shows 3 for hours the curtain is down for the exhibition of
processions and beasts, such as would make Democritus laugh‚ not at the scene but
the spectatore. As to the noise that goes on in the theatres, the foreste of Garganum
and the roaring of the sea are nothing to it. And what is it'all about? Has the actor
spoken ? Not a word. They are applauding his fine clothes!

(v. 208.) But lest you should think I bestow but grudging praise on an art Ι cannot
practise, Ι declare there is nothing that man is not capable of, in my opinion, who cun
move my soul with fiction and magician-like u-ansport me from place to place.

(v. 214.) But I pray you bestow some pati-onage on those who write, not for spectatore
but for readers3 so shall you worthily fill Apollo’s libi-ary, and give us poets a spur of
encouragement, though we do a great many wrong things Ι must admit ; for instance,
when we intrude upon you out of season 3 are offended at being told of a blemish3 repeat
our verses again and again without being asked3 mourn that our difficulties ure not
appreciated; expect you to send for us instantly, and bid us write, and make our for-
tunes. But we ought to consider who is worthy to be entrusted with the recording of
such virtues. Choerilus got gold from Alexander for his wretched verses3 but such,
like ink, only stain the deeds they profess to praise. Alexander judged better when he
ordered that none should paint him but Apelles, or make his statue but Lysippus.

But in the matter of poetry his taste was Boeotian. virgil and Varius do no disgraee ·

to your generosity; and no statue ever expressed the face of heroes more vividly than the
poet’s craft their souls. Much rather would 1 sing of your noble deeds; of conquered
lands, and rivers, and lofty heights, and barbarian realms3 of peace restored and Par-
thians terrified, if what Ι would Ι could. But Ι may not venture beyond my strength.
Officiousness often stupidly torments the object of its love, especially when it is allied
with verse. Men easily remember what gives them mirth, and for my put I have no
mind for such oppressive attentioris. I don't wish to have my features murdered in a
bust of wax, or to be celebrated in clumsy verse, lest Ι be carried out along with my
poet like a corpse on the poor man's bier, and consigned with him to his tomb in the

grocer's shop.

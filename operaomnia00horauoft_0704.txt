HORATII FLAOGI

Verum equitis quoque jam migravit ab aure voluptas

Omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana.

Quattuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas,

Dum fugiunt equitum turmae peditumque catervae; 190
Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis,

Esseda festinant, pilenta, petorrita, naves, -

Captivum portatur ebur, captiva Corinthus.

Si feret in terris rideret Democritus, seu

Diversum confusa genus panthera camelo, 195
Sive elephas albus vulgi converteret ora3

187. Verum equitis] Here Bentley,
‘ satis pro imperio' as Orelli says, and
⁸ frustra reclamantibus librariis,' as he says
himself, substitutes ‘ equiti' for ‘ equitis'
against all the MSS. Also on his own con-
jecture he substitutes ⁴ ingratos' for ‘in-
certos’ in the next verse: “ingratos vero
oculos vocat quod cito voluptatis oblivis-
cantur nullumque ex ea fructum percipiant
aut reddant.’' Other conjectures have been
offered by other editors; but ‘incertos,'
the reading of the Scholiasts and all the
MSS.‚ is a good word. The eye is easily
dazzled and deluded. The ear takes in what
it receives and conveys it to the mind with-
out error; and though Horace seems else-
where to commend the eye as a means of
instruction above the ear, the case is diffe-
rent. (See note on A. P. 180.) Cicero,
writing to M. Marius (ad Fam. vii. l),
speaks with a good deal of contempt of the
representations at the opening of the theatra
of Cn. Pompeius, in which he says: “ Ap-
paratus spectatio tollebat omnem hilarita-
tem—Quid enim delectationis habent sex-
centi muli in clytemnestra? (a play of
Attius) aut in Equo Trojano (a play of
Livius) crateiarum tria millia, aut armatura
varia peditatus et equitatus in aliqua pugna?
quae popularem admirationem habuerunt,
delectationem tibi nullam attulissent.'' The
supersession of the regular drama at our
great national theatres‚ and the substitution
of Wombwell for Shakspeare at Drury Lane,
furnishes a parallel to the degeneracy Horace
complains of.

189. aulaea premuntur] At the back
of the stage was the ¹ soena,’ or wall on
which was painted some scene suitable to
the performance. Before this ‘ scena ’ was
a curta-in, which was let down below the
stage when the acting began, and raised
when it was over. This curtain was called
⁴ aulaeum! The raising of the curtain at
tlh5e² end of the play is referred to in A. P.

, sq.:

“Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usqua
Sessuri donec cantor, Vos plaudite, dientss’

191. requm fortuna] This is equivaleut
to ‘ fortunati reges) The expression is like
those noticed at S. i. 2. 32; ii. l. 72.

192. Essedasestinanffl The ⁴ essedum ’
was originally the name of a Brifish οι·
Gaulish war chariot, derived from a Celtic
root. The name came to be appliedto a
travelling carriage on two wheels and drawn
by two horses. The ⁴ pilentum ' was a
carriage used in prooessions, and appears to

have been usually of a luxurious kind, with Α
well—stuffed cushions, and used by women. - ’

It was also a travelling carriage. As to

‘petorritum ’ see S. i. 6. 104, n.‚ and Epp. ,

i. 11.‘23, n.

193. captiva Corinthum] The taking of Β

Corinth may have been represented by
spoils of Corinthian bronze. So Acron
explains Corinthus by “ vasa corinthia?
194. Democritus‚] See Epp.i. 12. 12, n.
Democritus had the character of a‘laughing
philosopher, one who turned things habi-

tually into ridicule: the reason for which ⁷
opinion is not easily traeed in> what we '
aud sentimenta„ r
Juvenal (x. 33) says, ‘⁴ Perpetuo risu ppl-

know of his writings

monem agitare solebat Democritus;” havm
just before compared him with the
philosopher Heraclitus: ’

“ de sapientibus altu·

 

Ridebat quoties de limine moverat unum· >
Protuleratque pedem ; flebat oona-arim j

auctor. ' '

196. Sive elephas albus]

Ava has for one of his many titles the Lod ’

of the White Elephant3 and it has bem

usual for the British government, when an ²
elephant of this colour was caught in their 'L
territories‚ to send it with due ceremony αι ’
a present to his majesty. Whioe elephant· “

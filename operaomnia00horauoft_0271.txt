defeated Α.υ.σ. 737 by the Sigambri, but he retained his great influence with Augustus,

- whom it was not easy, we may believe, ιο impose upon. At any rete, if he was hypocrite

enough to deceive Angustus, Horace my be excused for assigning to him excellencies he
did not possem. The dete of the ode is not at all certain. The defeat of Lollius, which
caused ι great deal of alam et Rome, very probably raised a good many voioes against
him, and gave en advantage ιο his enemies ς and it is not improbable that Horace wrote
this ode to meet their attacks, and ιο console him under his defeat. The confident tone
that runs through it brings the ode under the remark made in the introduction ιο Ode

ARGUMENT.

Thinknotthst my verses will die: though Homer stands first among poete, Pindus,
Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Seppho,-these all survive. Helen was
not the first woman that loved ; nor Ilium the only city that has been sacked3 nor the
heroa of the Iliad all that have fought3 bnt the rest have been forgotten, because they
have no poet to sing of them. Buried virtue is little better than bnried dulness. I
will not therefore let thy labours pass unsung, Lollius, thy sagacity and npright-
nens, thy mind free from avarice and secure from corruption. It is not the pos-
sessor of richee that is wenlthy, but the man who knows how te use the gists of
Heeven and to endure poverty, who ham corruption, and is ready to lay down his life

⁷ for his country or his friends.

N E forte credas interitura quae
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum
Non ante vulgatas per artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis :
Non si priores Maeonius tenet 5
Sedes Homerus Pindaricae latent
Ceaeque et Alcaei minaces
Stesichorique graves Camenae3
Nec si quid olim lusit Anacreon
Delevit aetas; spirat adhuc amor
Vivuntque commissi calores

Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

1. NesorIe] “Ne circumflexe pronun-
tiandum est, Le. ne credideris.” This note

of C. iii. 30. 10? Though Horace says he
was born near the Aufidus, Venusia, his

of the Scholiast is, 1 believe, incorrect
(though Jani says it is ⁴⁴ simplicior et pro-
habilior ratio”), and so at any rate is Bax-
ter’s conclusion, ‘⁴ Forte igitur πλεονάζει.”
The sentence I think is : ⁴⁶ Lest pei-chance
you should suppose—remember that even if
Homer stands first Pindar is not forgotten.”
So lamb„ Cruquius, Heins., Bentley, and
most modern editors. If, as Orelli nuly
says, Horace feels a pride in referring to his
native stream, why does he object to the
explanation I have given as the most obvious

native town, was fifteen miles south of that
rIver, on that branch of the Via Appia
which leeds from Beneventum ιο Taren-
tum. As to ‘ne,' see S. i. 2. 80, n.

8. Stesichorique yraves Camenae ,·] 'Hie
muse of Stesichorus is called ⁴ gravis ¹ ns he
chose for his subjecte principally those
which belonged to Epic poetry, as wars and
heroes and so fort-h. “Magnae profundae3
nam et ipse bellorum scriptor,” is the Scho-

liast’s explanation of the word.

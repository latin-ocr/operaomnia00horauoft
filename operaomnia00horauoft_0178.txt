148 HORATII FLAOOI

same time. That Horace was still a frequenter of Baiae appears from v. 24. But when
he wrote Epp. i. 15, which was probably composed A.U.c. 731, he had been forbidden by
the doctor to go there, which Franke also notices as limiting the date of the ode.

ARGUMENT.

Come down, Calliope, and sing a lofty strain. Is it a dream or am I wandering in the
Muses’ grove ? I was a child, and tired with play I lay down to sleep on the Apuliau
hills. There doves made me a covering of leaves, and I slept safe, and men might well
wonder how the gods were present with me. Yours am 1, ye Muses, on the Sabine hilis,
at Tibur, at Praeneste, or at Baiae. Because Ι love your fountains aud your ehoir
I perished not when the battle was turned, nor by the accursed tree, nor in the Sicilian
waters. Be ye with me and Ι will visit the mad Bosporus, the sands of the Extat, the
savage Briton, the Conean, the Geloni, and the Tanais, unharmed. Ye refresh Augustus
when he brings back his weary troops from the war. Mild are your oounsels, and
in peace is your delight. We know how that bold giant band struck tarot into
the heart of J ove; but what was their strength against the aegis of Pallas? 'Twas that
which drove them back, though Vulcan too, and J uno, and Apollo with his bow, were
there. Brute force falls sels-destroyed: the gods detest violence, but tempered strength
they promote: let Gyas be my witness, Orion the seduoer, Earth mourning for her sons,
Aetna with its ever-burning and unconsuming flame, the vulture of Tityus, and tha
chains of Peirithous.

Dssscmm: eaelo et die age tibia
Regina longum Calliope melos,
Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.
Auditis, an me ludit amabilis 5
Insania? Audire et videor pios
Errare per lueos amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.
Me fabulosae Vulture in Apulo
Altrieis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum* palumbes

2. lonyum] This seems to mean a sus· with ⁴ altricis‚’ but it clearly belongs to ⁴ pa-
tained and stately song. There is a little lumbes ' the ¹ storied doves,’ ⁸³ ‘ fssbulom

Apennines that bore the name ⁴ Vultur ’ was
partly in Apulia and partly in Lucania. .

Mffia’ ἄγε Καλλιόπα, θύγατερ Διός,

4. citharaque] The balance of authority
is in favour of ‘ ve,' but the sense is against
it. There is no opposition between ‘ ci-
thara’ and ‘fidibus' They mean the same
thing. Bentley as usual prefers ‘ ve‚’ which
got into the MSS. probably from a careless
reference to ⁴ seu.’

6. piosErrare per lucos] See C. iv.2. 27.

9. fabulosae] The Scholiasta take this

It is still called Monte Vulture.' Ve-
nusia, Horace’s birth-place, was near the
boundary of those provinces, whence he
calls Apulia his nurse, though elsewhere
(S. ii. l. 34) he says it is doubtful whether
he was an Apulian or a Lucanian. Bentley
expresses the greatest contempt for this, the
ordinary interpretation, and proposes to read
⁸ nutricis extra limina sedulae ’ taking ‘ nu-
trix' literally. For that word he has au-
thority. The eldest Bernehas it: but ‘limina
sedulae ' is his own invention. Orelli says

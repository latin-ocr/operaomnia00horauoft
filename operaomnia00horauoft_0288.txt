HORATII FLAOGI

Injecit, emovitque culpas,
Et veteres revocavit artes

, ‘Increpuit lyra' therefore signifies, ‘checked
me by touching the strings of his lyre, aud
leading me to a strain more fitted to my
muse! That Doering g, after having given
and adopted this explanation, should have
changed his mind and followed the Scho-
liasts and those after them who join ‘’lyra
with⁴ loqui' is very surprising. His judg-
ment generally directed him better than
this. In a matter of taste second thoughts
are not often so good as the first, which are
directed by instinct. The other metaphor
is common enough. See Virgil (Georg. ii.
41). “Pelagoqueg volans da vela patenti3’
and Ovid (Tr. ii. 329). —-

“Non ideo debet pelago se credere si qua
Audet in exiguo ludere cymba lacu.'’

Prop. (iii. 9. 3) :-

⁴⁴ Quid me scpibendi tam vastum mittis in
Νέιῖᾳειιιιίιὶιῗιιρῒε. meae grandia vela rati.’'

4. Tua, Caesar, aetas] ΤΙιΘ abruptness
with which this is introduced is worth re-
marking. A longer preface would have
weakened the ode.

5. Fruqes et αρν-ὼ] This' is a repetition
of C. iv. 5. 17, sq

7. Derepta] There· is the usual conflict
of MSS. between‘ direp ta’ and‘ dereptast
but see C. 1ii. 5. 21, ιι. As the standards
were quietly and voluntarily sent to Augus-
tus by Phraates, Horace’s language is some-
what exaggerated. The recovery (in 734,
C. i. 26, Introduction3 iii. 5) of the stand-
ards lost by Crassus was one of the greatest
causes of rejoicing that ever happened at
Rome. Without it the restoration effected
by Augustus, and of which Horace here
gives a compendious picture, would have
been wanting in one of its chief features;
the honour as well as the peace of Rome
was restored. These praises are repeated
from or iu (for we cannot say which was
written first) Epp. ii. l. 251, sqq. See also
Epp. i. 18. 56.

9. Janum Quirini] This is the reading
of all the MSS. The usual form appears

to have been ⁴ J anus Quirinus‚’ as appears,
εεεε ⁶¹„st esee
ο - ι
and Macrobius (Sat. i. 9), ⁴⁴ Iu sacris quo·
que invocamus Janum Geminum, Janum
Patrem, Janum Junonium, Janum Con-
sivium, JANUM Qummuu, Janum Patu-
leium et clusivium.” There is no instance
Ι believe of Janum Quirini but this, and
the temple of Janus having been built,
according to tradition, by Numa and not
Romulus, there is much in favour of ⁴ Qui-
rinum.’ All that is against it is the want
of harmony arising out of‘ um’ thrice re-
peated, and the authority os the MSS.. to
which 1 yield with some hesitation, 1 admit,
in this case. Bentley ’s argument, that if
‘'Janus could be called‘ Janus Junonius:
he might as properly be styled ⁴ Janus
Junonis3’ and so, if he was rightly called
⁴ Janus Quirinus,’ therefore he might be
properly called ‘Janus Quirini: has no
weight. ‘Jauus Quirini’ ean only mem
‘Janus of Romulus‚’ whereas ‘Janus Qui-
rinus' means ⁸ Janus calledQuixinusss which
I take to be a substantive, and anaine εἶναι
him as Janus of the Quirites. The latter
is a proper description, the former isagainst
history. All the MSS. but one appear to be
in favour of the form ⁴ clausit,’ not ⁴ clusit.'
In the above passage of Suetonius they
vary; but Fea, quoting the inscription on
the monumentum Ancyranum, and which
it would seem that Suetonius copied, con-
tends that he must have writteu⁴ clausitf
which appears twice over in that inscrip- .
tion.

10. enaqanti] This no where else ap
pears with an accusative case, wherefore
some copyists have changed it into ‘et
vagantis which is very meagre. The most
respectable name by which it is supported
is Rutgersius. ⁴ Evadere ’ and ⁴ exire ’ are
used with an accusative repeatedly. (See
Forcell. aud compare C. iii. 24. 29.) ‘Artes '
is rightly explained by the Scholiast Acron
by ⁴ those virtues in which the discipline of
life is placed, as prudence, justice, fortitude,
and temperance.' ‘Emovit’ aud ‘amovit'

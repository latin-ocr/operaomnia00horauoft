doctrine he seems to have held pretty strongly,—we may doubt whether his philosophy is

to Bullatiue. Such reflectiom upon travel ns oecnr in this Epistle might naturally heve
suggested themselves whomsoever it had been written to. We ere not to judge Hornee’s
Epintlee ns we would private letters, meent only for the reading of the persons they are

We have no means of knowing when the Epistle wne written.

ARGUMENT.

What think you, Bnllafius, of the fine plmae of the Eat? are they not an tame compared
with our Campus and Tiber? Have you set your hem-t upon one of Attalus’ towns,
or are you so tired of ‹nvening thnt you must settle down at Lebedus, the dulloet of
places, as you know ? And yet Ι eould live there for a time, 1 conf-n, fol-getting home
and every body, to look out upon the stormy see. But the traveller who turns in to
his tnvern to roet would not stny there for ever3 and he who warms himself by the fire
or a hot bath doee not make these the end of his life. So if you have been tempest-
toet, and have been glad to put into port, is that any reason why you should sell your
ehip and never eome back ἓ Those parts are very well for sick people, bnt ns long aa
health and fortune let you be at Rome, stay here end praise Samos and the rest at a
distance. Be thankful for the bleasings of the day, und live for the present hour3 so
will yon be happy whatever plaoe you may be in. ”ris reason that takae awny eon-ow,
end we only change our elimo when we shift our place. It is bnt a busy idleness that

employa us when we seek happiness in ships and in conches. All you want is here or
nt dull Ulubrae, if your henrt be true and fail you not.

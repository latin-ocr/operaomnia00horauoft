24. Quo tibi, Tilli,] The Scholiasts
Aaou and Comm. Cruq. say that this
person, whose name is Tullius in some
. MSS. and editions, was a senator, and was
degraded by Julius Caesar as being of Pom-
peius' party; that hc was reinstated after
Caesen-’s death, and was made a military
tribune. One of Caesar's assassins was
Tullius Cimber, and it has been supposed—
1 do not know on what grounds—that this
man was his brother. Whether or no he
is different from the person mentioned
below, v. 107, it is not easy to say. Estre
denies, Orelli and others affirm, that he is
the same. There is not much to guide us.
Each legion in the Roman army (the num-
ber varied at different times, but at Philippi
there were nineteen on each side, each
legion consisting of about 6000 111011, rather
less than more) had six tribunes (the post
Horace held in Brutus’ army), who were
their principal officers. The military tri-
bunes of 1110 four first legions were entitled
to sit in the senate. (See Epod. Δ. 15, 11.)
As to the ‘latus clavus,’ see note on the
34th verse of the last Satire. ‘ Qu0,’ ‘to
what purpose! (See C. ii. 2. 9, n.)

27. Nam ut quisque insanus]
senators' ‘ calceus,' an out-door shoe, was
fastened by four thongs‚ two on each side,
which went spirally up to the calf of the
leg (medium crus). These thongs were
called ‘ corrigiae,' and were black. The
shoe itself appears to have varied in colour.
Juvenal (vii. 192) says of Quintilianus:
“appositam nigrae lunam Subtexit alutae,''
where the ‘ aluta ' is a shoe made of leather
softened in a solution of alum, and its
colonr is black. It also bears something in
the shape of a crescent ‘luna' (Ruperti says
a buckle), which Philostratus (Vita Herod.
ii. 8) calls σύμβολον τῆς εὐγενείας-ἐπι·
σφύριον (it must therefore have been worn
as high as the ancle) ἐλεφάντινον μηνόειόες.
Martial calls it “lunata pellis'' (i. 50. 31),
and again (ii. 9. 7, sq.):

“Non hesterna sedet lunata lingula planta,
Cogecigannon laesum cingit aluta pe·

where the shoe is purple or dar-k red. Such
a 31100 was the ‘ malleus) Becker suppones
this to have been the iuvas-table colour, aad
that Juvenal’s ⁴ nigrae ' must refer, 00 this
passage of Horace clearly does, only to the
striugs. (Gallus, Exc. ‘Male attire.’) 11
so, the string was of the same lentha- 00
the shoe, and passed over the ⁴ luna,’ which
was perhaps 011 the outer side of the foot.

29. Quis homo 11ἰο eet? quo] The
MSS. vary between this reading and ‘hia
et quo’ and ί1110, aut quo! The editors
differ. The reading 1 11010 followed (asper
Lambinus, Orelli, and others) seems well
suited to the sort of remark and queefion
supposed.

30. quo morbo Barrus] His diaetae
was a thirst sor admiration among women.
He is said by the Scholiasts Porphyrion and
Comm. Cruq. to have been a man of the
worst passions, and to have committed in-
cest wit-h Aemilia, a Vestal virgin. “ Certe
adulteras sincerissima cupiditate sectabatur ¹ ¹
Porphyrion says, in a tone which shows
110 had some known person in his mind.
But Aemilia was found guilty of incest,
together with two other Vestals, Marcia md
Licinia, A.u.c. 640. (Liv. Epit. 63.) Plu-
tarch mentions the circumstance (Quae-t.
Rom. 80), and says that among the persons
accused was one Βουτέτιος βάρβαρος,
which Fabricius has corrected into Βετού-
τιος Βαῤῥος, Betutius Barrus, which no
doubt is the correct reading. The Scholiasta
in all probability had read of this Barrus,
and confounded Horace’s coxcomb with
him. There was one of this family 'who '
was 0 distinguished provincial orator in
Cicero's time, mentioned by him in his
Brutus (c. 46). The name, therefore, is a
real one, but it does not follow that Horace
might not mean somebody of a different
name. Orelli assumes him to be the same
as the person mentioned in S. 4. 110 as
reduced to poverty, and adds, “ before he
was so reduced he was an immoderate
dandy and 0 licentious fellow,’' which is a
little too dogmatical in a matter so uncer-
tain. There is no similnity between tho

HORATII FLACGI

Nam Laurens malus est, ulvis et arundine pinguis.
Vinea submittit capreas non semper edules.
Fecundae leporis sapiens sectabitur armos.

Piscibus atque avibus quae natura et foret aetas

Ante meum nulli patuit quaesita palatum.

Sunt quorum ingenium nova tantum crustula promit.
Nequaquam satis in re una consumere curam,

Ut si quis solum hoc mala ne sint vina laboret,

Quali perfundat pisces securus olivo.

editions have ⁴ curvat.' Bentley, rather
perversely, considering that he acknowledges
the matter is indifferent, reads ‘ curvet ' on
little authority. The same oenfusion be-
tween the indicative and imperative is found
in C. iii. 19: “tribus aut novem miscentur
cyathis,” where some MSS. and editions
have ‘ miscentor.' (See note.) v

43. Vinea submittit] He says that the
flesh of wild deer fed in vineyards is not
always eatable. I confess I do not under-
stand what he meanS. How the ‘ caprea,' a
mountain goat, chamois, or some one of the
deer kind, should be habitually fed in vine-
yards,·as the verse seems to imply, is un-
intelligible to me. There is no variation in
the MSS. ‘Capreoli,’ and some say ‘ca-
preae ’ (see Foreell. sub. v.), were shoots of
the vine. But that sense has no place here
as the verse stands. ‘ Submittit ' is equiva-
lent to ‘ suppeditat,' ‘ supplies.' The only
other instance Forcell. quotes is C. iv. 4. 63:
“ Monstrumve submisere Colchi.” Hein-
dorf quotes Luoen (iv. 410): ‘¹ Non pabula
tellus Pascendis submittit equis.”

44. Fecundae leporis] The ancients had
odd notioris about the hare (which Sir
Thomas Browne has handled with his
usual learning and gravity, Vulgar Errors,
Book iii. c. 17), that it was of both sexes,
and that it was always with. young, and
brought forth two or three every nionth.
See Pliny (x. 63): “ Dasypodes omni mense
pariunt et superfetant, sicut lepores.”
Herodotus mentions the same circum·
stanoe (iii. 60), ὁ λόγος-οὕτω δὴ τι
πολύγονόν ἐστι, ἐπικυΐσκεται μοῦνον πάν-
των θηρίων· and Aristotle the same
(Hist. An. vi. 33), οἱ δὲ δασύποδες ὀχεύ-
ονται καὶ τίκτουσι πᾶσαν ὥραν καὶ ἐπι-
κυΐσκοντηι ὅταν κύωσι. καὶ τίκτουσι κατὰ
μῆνα. The superfetation of the hare and
rabbit is an admitted fact. The Scholiasta
and all the old editions, and the majority

of MSS, have ‘fecundi. ⁹ Cruquius,1
believe, first edited‘ fecundness which ap
peared in his oldest Blandinian MS.
Bentley adop ted the reading, and most
modern editors have done the sams. Lepus
is no where else used' ιιι the feminine gaudet.
but 1 believe it might be in such a case ns
this, and Priscian (p. 658, quoted by Bent-
ley) say s it is of common gender. Orelli' s
St Gallen MS. has ‘fecundae,' and that
editor adopts it. as he does ‘’albae with
‘anseris' in S. 8. 88. Either 1 think would
do. *A modern epicure would not choose
the shoulder of a hare as the most deli-
cate part. It is so distinguished again S.

9. 7, n. raepecting the different wines men-
tioned here. The wine in the amphora
required clearing before it could be drunk.
One way of effecting this appears to have
been exposing the vessel for some lime to
the open air, which process also took off
some of its strength.p1n Athenaeus (p. 33,
A) we find this advice, οἰνοποιητέον δ’
αὐτοὺς πρό τινος χρόνον καὶ εἷς ἀναπεπτα-
μένον τόπον θετέον εἷς τὸ διαπνεῦσαι τὸ
παχὺ τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτῶν. Pliny also
(xiv. 27) informs us that· ‘Campaniae no-
bilissima exposita sub dio in cadis verberari
sole, luna, imbre, ventis aptissimum vide-
tur.” Catius mentions the yolkof pigeons’
eggs as another means of predpitating the
lees of the wine. White of egg however
was a more usual agent. Pliny mentions
sulphur3 several insoluble maten-isla, such
as pounded shells, gypsum, chalk, milk, &eq
were used for the same purpose. But the
commonest way was to strain the wine
either through a‘ saccus, ’a bag of fine linen
(which was apt to hurt the flavour), or
through a metal sieve, ‘sscolum these being
in the ghot weather fiu’ed with snow.

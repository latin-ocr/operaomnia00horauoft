HORATII FLA 001

Arm, nostrorum sermonum candide judeX‚‘

Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?

Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat,

An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,

Curantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est? 5

Non tu corpus eras sine pectore.

1. sermonum] It is a matter of discus-
sion whether these ‘semones’ were the
Epistles or Satires, or both. The Satires
must have been published some time, and
some of the Epistles may have been written
and made known to Horace’s intimate
friends. I think there can be no doubt the
word ‘sermones’ applioe (whether Horace
published them with that title or not) to
the Epistles as well as the Satires, and
whatever Tibullus had seen he approved,
which is all we can gather from the text.
Acron writes ‘⁴ Albius ille criticus fuit et
scriptor philosophiae.'' By ‘criticus’ he
probably meant ‘ grammaticus ' (see Epp. 1.
19. 40, n.); but he is plainly wrong.

2. reqione Pedana ἕ] See Introduction.

3. Cassi Parmensis opuscula] Parma
(Parma) was a town belonging to the Boii,
at the edge of the Macri Campi, in Cisal-
pine Gaul, on a river of the same name
which runs into the Po about twelve miles
north of the town. The Via Aemilia passed
through Parma. Cassius of Parma has
been referred to before on S. i. 10. 61,
where it was stated that the Scholiasts had
confounded him with the bad poet of
Etruria there mentioned. That person is
entirely unknown. Cassius of Parma was
one of the murderers of Julius Caesar,
and a ‘tribunus militum’ in the army of
Brutus and Cassius. He was therefore in
all probability well known to Horace.
After following the fortunes of Sex. Pom-
peius he joined M. Antonius, on whose
side he fought at the battle of Actium.
After that battle he retired to Athens, and
there he was put to death by order of Au-
gustus. Acron, after stating most of the
above particulare, which are confirmed by
the historiam, says, ⁴‘ Qu. Varus (or Varius,
as it is in the commentary of Porphyrion3
Comm. Cruq. has Varus) ab Augusto
missus nt eum interficeret, studentem re-
perit: et perempto eo scrinium cum libris
tulit. Unde multi crediderunt Thyestem
Cassii Parmensis fuisse: scripserat enim
multas alias tragoedias.” It has been sup-
posed that L. Varius, Horace's friend, the
dramatic and epic poet, who wrote a tragedy
called Thyestes, is meant by the Qu. Varus

Di tibi formam,

of the Scholiasts, and that they mean to
affirm that he stole it from Cassius. (See
C. i. 6. 8, and S. i. 5. 40.) But Estne
suggests that Qu. Altius Varus, to whom
the sixth Eclogue of Virgil is addmsed,
and who was a poet, was the executum of
Cassius referred to hythe Scholiasta. A
very elaborate treatise yhas been written (by

Weichert) res the two Cassii, in
which, besides establishing the distinction

between them, he produces a few fragments
which are supposed to belong to Cassius of
Parma; and he attributes to him the epi
gram on Augustus, beginning‘ ‘Quum
primum istorum conduxit mensa choragum‚”
quoted by Suetonius in his life (c. 70).
What the‘ opuscula’ Horace refers to may
have been we do not know, but it is clear
that *he thought well of them-⁶ Acron’s
note on this person begins, ‘Hic aliquot
generibus stylum exercuit· inter quae opera
elegiaca et epigrammata ejus laudantur?
What confidence is to be placed in this
assertion, part of which at least might
easily be got from the text, we cannot 13811.
Obbarius thinks Horace gave a strong proof
of his friendship for his old campaniola in
arms by ypraising one who lud died under
the displeasure of Augu stus. But thom
quarrels had long been foi-gotten-
4. silvas inter reptare salubrem] ‘ ’
(freqnentative of repo), which oontm'ns un
same root as ἕρπω, significa to munte, ω
go about quietly; and Lnoeetius applica it
to flocks of sheep grazing on downs (ii.

317)=

“Nam saepe in colli tondentes pabula laetu
Lanigerae reptant pecudes, quo quamque
Ingffipffgrboep

The woods are called ⁸ salubres’ beoeuse
their shade protecte from the heat of the
sun, as Cicero says (Cat. Μ. c. 16)= “Ubi
enim potest illa aetas (senectus) aut oelescere
vel apricatione melius vel igni, aut vicissim
umbris aquisve refrigerari salubrius. ”¹

6. Non tu corpus eras sine pectora]
‘Sine pectore’ is used twice by Ovid (Met.
xiii. 290)‚‘ ‘rudis et sine pectore miles.”
Heroid. xvi. 305·

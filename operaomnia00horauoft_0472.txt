47. Cervius iratus —urnam,] Comm.
Cruq. is the only one of the Scholiasts who
gives auy account of this man. He says:
“ Cervius Ascanii libertus calumniator ac-
cusavit Cn. Calvinum lege de Sicariis.'’
Estre, following Lambinus, thinks we should
read Servius, and that the person meant is
Servius Pola, whom Cicero mentions as a
low informer (ad Quintum Frat. ii. 13).
His friend Coelius, writing to Cicero (ad
Fam. viii. 12), mentions the same person as
one whom his enemies were trying to enlist
to lay an information against him. The
...scs
consul A.u.c. 700. Another Cervius is
mentioued below (S. ii. 6), a totally dif-
ferent person. ¹ Urnam' means the ιιι-ιι
into which the judices put their* tablets,
or that into which their names were put
for drawing the jury, as the Scholiasts say.
Either way it is equivalent to ‘ judicium!

48. Canidia Albuti, quibus] Acron
understauds this to mean Canidia the
daughter of Albutius. Porphyrion says,
“ Amphibolice posuit :” for it may be either
what Acron says or the poison of Albutius.
“hic enim Albutius veneno uxorem suam
dieitur peremisse.” Comm. Cruq. takes it
the first way, referring to Virgil's ‘⁴ Deiphobe
Glauci” (Aen.vi. 36). Duentzer goes fax-ther,
and supposes Canidia to have been ‘ amica
Albutii 3' that he is identical with the Varus
of Epod. v., and had his name, as she hers,
from his white bair, which is all mere in-
vention. Porphyrion’s story may be as·
sumed to be the true one, or like the truth,
Albutius being a person notorious for having
poisoned somebody. We meet with another
Albutius below (S. 2. 67), whom Porphyrion
identifies with this person, and says he
poisoned his wife because he wanted to
marry another woman. There are no
grounds for contradicting this assertion,
and but little for believing it.

49. Grande malum Tur-ina] Of this

50

person we know nothing; but Porphyrion
says, “ Hic praetor fuit apud quem accu-
satus est a Cicerone Verre· Hortensio de-
fendente.” On that occasion Μ’. Acilius
Glabrio was praetor. Comm. Cruq., iu a
note of which the text is very corrupt,
calls him C. Marius Turius, and says he was
‘judex corruptissimus,' that he presided at
Verres' trial, and gave out tablets of diffe-
rent colom-s, that he might know which of
the judices voted according to his wishes,-
-which is clearly all taken from a mis-
understanding of the words cioero puts
into the mouth of Hortensius (Divin.
c. 7). The words ‘¹ magnus ille defensor
et amicus ejus” (i. e. of Verres), by which
Cicero means Hortensius, the Scholiast ap-
plies to Turius. Asconius, on the above
chapter of Cicero, has a note which may have
led to the confused statements of the Scho-
liasts: ⁴‘ Terentius Varro consobrinus stater
Hortensii reus ex Asia apud L. Furium prae-
torem primo de pecuniis repemndis, deinde
apud P. Lentulum Suram est accusans
absolutusque est a Q. Hortensio, qui cor-
ruptis judicibus hunc metum adjunxit ad
gratiam ut discoloribus ceria &insignitas
judices tabellas acciperent, ” δια, when-e
perhaps for Furium we should read Turium,
though Cruquius prefers changing Horace’s
Turius into Furius, which the meta-e will
not allow. Doering, however, follows hini.
As praetor, Turius could not be called
judex. The threat has reference most pro-
bably to a ¹ causa privata,' an action nt law,
in which Turius might act as judex. (See
Dict. Ant, art. ‘Judiciuum ’) ‘si quis se
judice certet’ is the reading of Lambinus
and the editions of the sixteenth century.
‘Si quid—certet' is that of Ven. 1483 and
others of the earliest editiuns. The reading
os the text, Fea says, is in the Venetian
edition of 1481. It is supported by tho
best MS. authority, and Bentley has done
well to restore it to the text.

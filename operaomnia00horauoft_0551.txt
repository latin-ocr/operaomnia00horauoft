popular nofion was that Pythagoras had

sofiombeans, which classes vegetables he
connected somehow or other with the
hm spedoe in his doctrine of metem-
psydiusis, though different reasons are
assigned by different writers (see cie. de

Gellius (iv. ll) affirms that the fact is not
to be believed, quoting Aristoxenus, who,

doubt Horace refers to the popular opinion
that those. vegetablae were forbidden fare to
the disciploe of
ciful nofion that in eating them they might
be devouring their own flesh and blood.
Hence the expression ‘ cognata‚' and this is
the allusion in Epp. i. 12. 21, “ seu porrum
et caepe truddas.” As to Horace's vege-
table meals, see S. i. 6. 115.

66. Ante Larem proprium] See note
on Epod. ii. 66. ⁴ Libatis dapibus ' means
that the master and his fiiends (⁸ meique’)
dined lightly‚ and left the greater part of
the dishoe to his slaves. sse master, in
this instance, as well as his slaves, dined in
the ⁴ atrium,’ where the ' os the Lares
were plaoed. ‘Libare ’ is to touch lightly.
See Aen. v. 90, ‘⁸ inter pateras et levia
pocula serpens Libavitque dapes;''
Ovid (Am. i. 4. 34) :—

and

‘⁴ si tibi forte dabit quos praegustaverit ipse ’
Rejice libatos illius ore cibos.'’

Cicero, daeoeibing Verroe' riotous living,
says, ‘iste enim praetor severus ac diligens
qui populi Romani legibus nunquam paru·
isset, illis diligenter legibus quae in poculis
ponebantur obtemperabat ” (Act. ii. l. 5.
). One of the strictest laws of a ban-
quet directed by a presiding symposia-ch
would have reference to the regulation of
the quantity of wine to be drunk by each
guest at each round. Horace’s notion of
liberty here is to be able to drink as much
or as little as he pleaeed, which· is expressed
by‘ inaequales calices! ⁴

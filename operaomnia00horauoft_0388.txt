HORATII FLAGCI

doctrines taught him by his master Clean-
thes, and Cleanthes was a devoted disciple
of Zeno. For the life of Chrysippus the
reader may consult the Dict. Biog. ‘In-
giluidibglfssiii flatu Shldls‘izis’tgoc ‘ssaazieiilill’altild
after ⁴ qui ? ’ to ‘sic rex’ (v. 133). What
he means to affirm in reply to the taunt
⁴ cur optas quod habes ?' is, that a man may
be, in the Stoic sense, a king, and yet not
be in a condition to exercise authority, 88
811 artizan or a singer may still be great in
his calling even when he has laid 'aside the
practice of it.

127. crepidas — soleas ]
(κρῆπις) 1188 8 low shoe or slipper taken
from the Greeks and worn in undress.
‘ solea' was a plain sandal fastened over the
instep by a strap, and worn by men as the
⁶ sandalium’ was worn by women. Gellius
(xiij. 21) makes the ⁴ crepida' and ⁴ solea’
identical, which they evidently were not in
Horace's day at least. “Omne ferme id
genus quibus plantarum calces tantum in-
fimae teguntur, caetera prope nuda et tere-
tibus habenis vincta sunt, ‘ solea-s’ dixerunt,
nonnunquam Graeca voce ‘crepidulas,'—
ejusque calceamenti sutores ⁸ crepidarios’
dixerunt.” The ‘ soccus ’ was not materially
different from the ‘ crepida,' and the ‘ Gal·
lica, ⁷ adopted from Gaul, was like the
‘ solea! None of these were walking-shoes
(‘ calcei ') fit for wet or dirty roads, but were
ordinarily worn only in the house.

129. Hermoyenes] It 1188 118811 stated
in the Introduction to the second Satire
that this person has been confounded with
Tigellius whose death 18 mentioned in that
satire, and whose character 18 described at
the beginning of this. Hermogenes is 8180
called Tigellius in S. 4. 73; lo. 80, 90. But
as he is always spoken of as alive. it is im-
possible he can be Caesar’s friend, Tigellius
the Sardinian, to whom, as observed before,

‘ Crepida'

much in S. 9. 25. But he had 8 contempt
for him in other respects, 88 appears from
S. 4. 73; 10. 17 (where he mlle him a cox-
comb), and 10. 79 (where he introduces
him with a fool for 1118 friend or parasite).
He may have had some private pique against
him.

130. Affeniua misem] I have adopted
the orthography of this name which Orelli
says is found in an inscription respecting
P. Alsenius, who was consul A. 11. 2. He 18
0811811 Alphinius by Clinton (F. H. A. 1). 2).
Acron says on this p “Urbane satia
Alfenum Vafrum (Varum ἓ) Cremonensem
deridet: qui abjecta sutrina quam in muni-
cipio suo exercuerat Romam venit3 1118518·
troque usus Sulpicio jurisconsulto ad tanum
pervenit scientiam ut et consulatum gereret,
et publico officio fungeretur.” Porphyrion
has nearly the same words, and Comm.
Cruq. has compounded the two, only
changing ‘Alfenum vafrum' to ‘Alfinium
Varum, ’ and giving Sulpicius the name of
Marcus. Estre (187), agreeing with
Weichert (Lect- Ven. pp. 45. aqqq) thinks
there' 18 nothing improbable inthe 81111ο118818Ι
statements. They ap ppear to me to becom-
pounded of different clemente, one of which
is the passage before us. The Scholiasta,
it 18 obvious, occasionally give 88 infor·
mation that which they appear only to have
gathered from the text. That the disdple
of Sulpicius, who died A. u. c. 710, was not
the consul of A. u. 0. 755, we may be pretty
sure. 1 have little doubt the jurist, the
consul, and Horace' 8 ex· sutor (most pro- ·
bably a different person from either of them),
have all been drag ged in to make up the
story of the Scholiasts.1t should be said
however that the jurist is reported by Pom-
ponius to 11818 110111 the consulship. But 110
00118111 of that name appears till the above
Publius, who is with more probability sup-
posed to have been the jurist's son than the

there are no grounds for giving the name jurist himself. In Cruquius’ oldest Blan-

Hermogenes, though the Scholiasta give it
him. Hermogenes Tigellius was 8 teacher
of 11111810 (S. 10. 90), and (whether ironically

or not it 18 not easy to say) Horace 08118
him a first- rate 8111581· here, and implies 88

dinian MS. ⁴ sutor’ in v. 132 appeared as a
corrected reading for ⁴ tonsor,' the original
word. Cruquius likes ‘ tonsor' betterthan

‘auton’ and quotes Alexander ab Alexandro

Qui locus a forti Diomede est conditus olim.
Flentibus hinc Varius discedit maestus amieis.
Inde Rubos fessi pervenimus, utpote longum

Carpentes iter et factum corruptius imbri.

ancient ruins may be traced fragments of
aqueducts. tombs, amphitheatres, baths,
military columns, and two triumphal arches.
The present town stands on a height where
the dtadel stood, and contains not above
30⁰ houses. “The medals of Canusium
in silvei· and bronze have the inscriptions
Ka. KANY. ΚΔΝΥΣῙΝΩΝ, with a head
of Hercules on a vase and clusters of
grapoe” (th-amer, Italy, ii. p. 292, n.).
A supply of good water was brought into
this town by Hadrian the emperor. That
ia was not well watered has been

observed before (Epod. iii. 16, ιι.). The
tui-bid waters of the Aufidus must have
been unfit for drinking. The bread of Ca-
nosaseemstobeasbadasever. Swin-
burne writes (i. 166): ‘¹ We breakfasted at
an ina-near the bridge, and regretted our
not having followed Horace’s example in
bringing a supply of bread from some other
place, for what we got here was as brown as
mahogany, and so gritty that it set our teeth
οιι edge to crunch it. The friable incom-
pta contexture of the stone with which the
millers grind their corn, rather than the
saud of the area where it is trodden out,
can alone have perpetuated this defect in
the Canusian bread for nineteen centuries.
I believe these millstones are of the soft
conta-eted rock, which constitutes the greater
part of their coast. ”

aquae non ditior urna] The only way of
taking this regularly is with Lambinus, to
make‘ ditior' agree with ⁸,locus’ ⁴

p‚lacs being not richer in water (thau the
last) by a single pitcher, was built by brave
Diomed! So Orelli takes it. ΤΙιθ construc-
tion is not very agreeable3 but to avoid it
we must suppose great irregularity. Bentley
makes‘ urna’ the nominative, and* ditior'
to agree with it in the sense of‘ uberior!
He atrike· out the next verse as unmeaning
aud unworthy of Horace.

9⁸. Varius] See above, v. 40, n.

9⁴. Rubos] This town of the Peucetii
retains its name under the form Ruvo, and
was thirty miles from Canusium. The
medals found at Ruvo have the inscriptions
ΡΥ. ΡΥΒΔ. m. ΡΥΒΑΣΤΕῙΝΩΝ. They
have also a head of Minerva or Jove, and

on the reverse an owl on a brauch. The
road from Canusium was called via Egnatia,
from the town it led to. Swinburne (i. 400)
describes the remains of it for twelve miles
from Canosa as paved with common rough
pebbles, and passing over apleasant down.
Half way between Canusium and Rubi the
Jerusalem Itinerary mentions a place which
it calls ‘ad Quindecimum,’ and which is
now identified with Castel del Monte.

96. adusque] SeeS. i. l. 97, ιι.

97. Bari moenia piscosi, ·] Barium still
retains its name Bari, occupying a rocky

peninsula of a triangular form about a mile ⁷

in circumference.1t was an important town
on the coast, and a municipium. Its dis-
tance from Rubi was twenty-two miles, ‘⁸ a
most disagreeable stony road through a vine
country” (Swinburne, i. 3217). and half way
there lay the town Butuntum (Bitonto).
Brass coins have been discovered at Bari,
bearing, ou one side a head of Jupiter
crowned with laurel, on the other a figure
of Cupid seated at the prow of a veesel, and
shootiug an arr-ow, with the inscription
ΒΑΡΙΝΩΝ. Others with a head of Jupiter
and the prow of a vessel and the inscription
BAPI. Others again with a head of Pallas,
and a ship, and Cupid crowuing a trophy.
There must have been a harbour, it would
be thought, to receive the galleys which,
from the above coins, it is evident this
place possessed. But there is scarcely any
now. See Swinburne, who writes (i. 191),

‘a plentiful fish supper was provided by
our kind host (the Prior of a Dominican
convent), anxious to support the reputation
of Bari· ιιι that article. The abundance and
delicacy of the fish vouch for Horace's
knowledge of the peculiar excellencies of
his own country. ’¹

Gnatia] This was perhaps the local
way of pronouncing Egnatia. lt was another
sea- -port town, and thirty· seven miles from
Barium. Between them lay formerly, ac-
cording to the Itinerarioe, two small forts
called gTurris. Juliana (Torre Pellosa) and
Turris Aureliana (Ripagnola),the first eleven
miles and the second twenty miles from
Barium. Of Egnatia nothing important is
recorded. Its ruins are still in existence

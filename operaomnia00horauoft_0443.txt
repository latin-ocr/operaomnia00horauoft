Aggere m aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes . 15
Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum;

Gum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque suetae

Hunc vexare locum curae sunt atque labori,

Quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis

Humanos animos. Has nullo perdere possum 20
Nec prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum

Protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes.

Such sep ulcha-es

mued ‘hereditaria’ Horace writes as if
therewere a stone set upon somepartof
the boundary of thid burial- ground, with
the inscription usual ou private monuments,
u.u.11.N.s., which is obviously only a

’ satire. The words could only apply to a
· private place os burial. All he really means

is, that a space of ground of the extent he
nenuons was marked off for the burial of
these poor people. For other examples of
such insu-iptions, see Fabi-etti Insc. Antiq.

14. Nune licet Esquiliis] The whole of

thsBsquiline orfisth regionof Rome, was
called Esquiliae. This from having been

an eye-sore and a pingue-spot became a
healthy and pleasant mideuce. Suetonius
tells ua that A when hewasill, went
toMaecenas’ housein tbeEsq uiliaetore-
cruit (Oetav. c. 72). The‘ agger' here
reserredtowasa raised terracecommuced
byServiua Tullim, and oerriedbyhimfroin
the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquiline.
lt was continued (amrding to Cramer, who
quotes Dion Halic- iv. 54) by Tarquinius
Priscus as far as the Porta Querquetulana,
being' ιιι all about twelve mffl'l and about
fisty feet in breadth. It thus skirted on
the east the whole of the fisth or Esquiline>

quta Semita from thid great work. Herc
the Romans walked in cold westher ιο get
the sun, and had a fun view of the poetilent
plain which Maecenas converted into a
paradise. Juvenal calls it ‘ventosus’ (S.
viii. 43). Bentley edits ⁴ qua' in v. 15, and
is followed by some editors. lt is against
all the MSS. and older editions, and ⁴ quo,'
in the sense of 'ex quo,' will do very
well.

17. cun· milei nou tantum] ‘eum’ is
thus connected with what gooe before.
Priapus says the locality is now made
heulthy, and the citizens may take their
walk without being sickened with the sight
os bones bleaehing upon the plain, whereas
his vexations still remain ,—the driving away
of thieves and wild animals which sun fre-
quented the spot, and yet worse the punish-
ment and scaring away of the witchoe who
there continued to carry on their abominablc
practices. We need not infer with Dacier
that the place was not yet entirely changed
or cleared of the bones that disfiguredit,
but may suppose the witchae still continued
from habit to haunt the scene of their ini·
quities, and that the ‘fiuoe’ and ‘ferae.'
are the depredators that came to rob the
gai-dens which were the god’s particular
cure. 1 am not awareofanyother instance
of ⁴ suetus ' being used as a trisyllable.

Insanire paret certa ratione modoque.

Quid, cum Picenis excerpens semina pomis
Gaudes si cameram percusti forte, penes te es?
Quid, eum balba feris annoso verba palato,

-Aedificante casas qui sanior? Adde cruorem
Stultitiae atque ignem gladio scrutare.

quotes this in coujunctiou with
others, in which ‘explico ’ signifies to gain
a point or serve a purpose. He explains
‘explicet’ by ‘efficiatss ‘assequaturss ‘ob-
tineat! There is a like use of this word in
Caesar (B. G. viii. 4)= “Explicandae rei
frumentariae causal' It is also used in
a pemliar sense inC.iv.9.44,where see

272. Picenis excerpens semina pomis]
The orchards of Picenum, the district that
lay between the country of the Sabines and
the Hadriatic, appear to have been cele-
brated. In the next Satire (ver. 70) Pice-

de corbibus isdem
Aemula Picenis et odoris mala recentis?

The pears of this same country are com-
mended by Pliny (N. H. xv. 15, 16). Mar-
tial mentions the olives and the bread of
Picenum as particularly good (xiii. 36 and
47). The Scholiasts Porphyrion and Comm.
Cruq. explain the sport here alluded to.
Lovers, say they, were wont to take the pips
of apples between their finger and thumb
and shoot them up to the ceiling, and if
they struck it then their wish would be ac-
complished. Pollux relates the same sports
(ix. 128), and some such are common in
our own narsei-ies. ‘Camera,' which is
stom the Greek καμάρα, and is sometimes
spelt with an ‘a‚' was an arched ceiling, as
‘lacunar’ was fiat. The latter was so

 

called from panels with raised sides, and so
⁴ having each the appearance of a ‘ lacus ' or
shallow reservoir, into which the ceiling was
sometimes divided. It was common iu rich
housee 'for the ceiling to .be richly orna—
mented. See C. ii. 18. 2: ‘⁴ Non ebur
neque aureum mea renidet in domo la-
cunar.'' Pliny (xxxiii. 3) says, ‘⁴ Laquearia
quae nunc et in privatis domibus auro te-

guntur, post Carthaginem eversam primo
inaurata sunt in Capitolio.'’ ‘Laquear is
another form of ‘ lacunar! Horace also
uses the expression ⁴ laqueata tecta ’ (C. ii.
16. 12), which is found in other writers.
ovid alone uses the word ⁴ lacuuo,' to form
such ceilings (Met. viii. 563).

273. penes te ee 2] This seems to cor-
respond to the Greek ἐν ἐαυτῷ εἶναι, for a
man iu his right mind: or it may mean
to ask if the man is ‘ suo jure,’ which one
who was ‘ furiosus ' would not be.

274. cum balbaserir] Persius has imi-
tated this in a different connexion (i. 33) 2-—

“ Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare lo-
Phyn‘illlzz'flypsipylas vatum et plorabile
Eliqtiligugg tenero supplantat verba pa-

Persius says ‘he trips his words on his
mincing palate ς’ Horace says ‘you strike
your lisping words against your old palate!

275. Adde cruorem Stultitiae] But
childish nonsense is not the worst of this
madness. Add bloodshed to folly and run
into the most violent excesses of passion,
and you will not do more thau such lusts
commonly lead to. Such is the Stoic’s
meaning. ‘Ignem gladio scrutare' is a
translation of a Greek saying, πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ
σκαλεύειν, ‘ to stir the fire with the sword‚'
which Diogenes Laert. (viii. 17) attributes
to Pythagoras. Heindorf says it is capable
of various interpretations. Its application
here seems plain. Το sfit the fire of lust
with the swerd, is to stir up strife and blood-
shed in the indulgence of your lusts.

276. Modo, inquam, Hellade percussa]
‘To take a late instance) seems to be the
meaning of ‘modost The story here re-
ferred to, as Estre says, was probably well
known at the time, but of the actors'in it
we know nothing. ‘ Cerritus‚' Festus says,
is another form of ‘ cereritus,' which signi-

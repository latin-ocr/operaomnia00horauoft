· (v. fio.) Ennius is 8 suge, and bold, and another Homer, in the eyes of our 111-ἥξω. He

(v. m.) Smnetimes the vulgar judgment is right, sometimes it is wrong. 11 it prefers

member too well Orbilius and his cane); bnt that any one should think them perfec-
tionisto me surprising. lfa single word startsup here and there better-than thei-est
it carries off the 1111018. 08 the other hand Ι am indignant that any thing should be
found fault with, not because it is bad but because it is new, and that not indulgence
but honour should be demanded foi· the old. If Ι express a doubt about 8 play of
aasz, all the old men cry out against my impudence for venturing to find fault with
ssiat which Aesopus and Roscius acted. But the real reason is that they consider
nothing can be right but what satisfies them, or they oennot bear ιο throw away in their

ν age what they got by beart as boys. But he who praises the songs of the Salii, which

he undet-stands no better than Ι 110, does so not from love to them but out of envy to
115. 15 Greece had always hated novelty as we do, what should we have had that· is ,
old? When she began to turn tremum, and todegeneratewith hernewfortunae,
she went from athletes to horsae, from sculpture to painting, from music to tragedy,
like 8 spoilt child. But it was to be expected when peace 81111 prosperity came 3 every
thing that delights is apt to pall.

(v. 1⁰3.) Once at Rome we used to see men rising early ιο expound the law ιο clients, oi·
leaming how to make money and to be thrifty. Now it is all changed, and every
body' is for writing poetry. 1 myself when Ι 11881818 Ι shall write no more lie like 8
Parthian, and begin scribbling before sun- rise. No man undertakes to steer 8 ship
who knows not how3 none administer medicinas but physicians, or handle tools but
workmen3 and yet, learned or unlearned, we all write poetry. This little error how-
ever has its advantagee. The poet loves not money, fears not loss of property, cheats
not his partner or his ward, lives plainly; and though he is of no use in war, he is of
use at home, if you allow that small things may help the great. The poet forms the
lips and chastens the minds of the young ς 118 records great deeds, furnishae great ex-
amples, consoles the poor and sick. Where would be our choirs but for the Muse?
qu should we pray ιο the gods? The homely rustics of the olden time, aster harvest,
used to gather themselves together and offer sacrifice to Tellus and Faunus and their
genius. Through them came in the Fescinnine verse, which then was innocent of
offence, till the liberty was turned into licence, and the law stepped in to arrest it.
When Greece became our prisoner she enslaved hei· captors, and brought in among us
new arts, and drove out that rough old Saturnian measure, though even now there
romain tiaoes of the old rusticity. It was not till aster the Punic wars that we began
to turn oui· minds to the writings of Greece, and tried if we could translate their
tragedias We were successful, for we have 8 spirit losty and bold and tragic enough,
but our style needed correction.

(v. 168.) Comedy is supposed ιο have less labour than tragedy, bemuse its subjects

188 HORATII FLAGGI

dreamt of any thing of the sort, else they would not have failed to enrich their liter-ry
histories, in which they oerefiilly stick in every name they can pick up, with that of this
Telephus. But it looks rather ill that this well-bred learned Greek, who lived on such
intimate terms with Horace, is never heard of in any other place. The best information
about him may be gleaned from the other two odes. Telephus is a poetical name which
Horace uses when it suits his purpose, as here, for instance, when he wanted such an one
to give an air of individuality to an ode beginning with the humorous repr-eof, ‘ Yon teu

, us a great deal about the race of Codrus and of Aeacus, and about the Trojan War, but as - 1

to how, where, and on what we are to dine to-day, you don't say a word.”’ This is Butt-
mann’s opinion, and I think any sensible man who reflects on the subject, without pre-
oonoeptions of reality in his mind, will agree with him. At any rate a very slight ground-
work of truth would be enough for the part that Telephus bears in this ode, and on such
questions conjecture and time are thrown away. Of the date we can only say it was
written before A.u.c. 732, for the reasons stated C. ii. 10. The season was winter (v. 8).
and the day was the first of the mouth (probably of the year).

Dillenbr. supposes the ode to have arisen out of the following scene. On a cold dull
winter evening Horace is sitting in a room with some friends. They are talking and
drinking without much spirit, till at last the dulness of the conversation turning upon dry
points of history, through the prosy pedantry of some one of the party, Horace can bear
it no longer, and bursts out with the contemptuous language with which the ode begins3
then calls his friends to drink, and sets them the example. It is easy to adnpt such ⁸
scene to the ode3 but there can be little doubt, Ῑ think, that it is one on which Horace
bestowed more than average pains, though there is no ode in which the “arscelare artem”
is more conspicuous. It is impossible to suppose it the work of a moment, as musula-Is
very neat adaptation would require us to suppose. He thinks the ode is one of the early
ones, as more akin to the fire of youth than the sobriety of later lise, to which ,remark 1
attach no importanee.

ARGUMENT.

Talk not of Codrus, and Inachus, and Trojan wars: tell us what we may get a eask of
Chian for, who will give us bath and house-room, and at what hour we may dine to-day.
A cup, boy, to the new moon, another to midnight, and a third to Murena the augur ς
three and nine or nine and three3 the rapt poet loves the nine; pure the Graues foa-bid.
Let us be mad: bring music, scatter roses, let old neighbour Lycus and his young ill-
sorted partner hear our noise and envy us. Rhode runs aster thee, Telephus, with thy
beautiful hair and bright face ε as for me, I am wasting with love of Glycera.

number of years between Inachus, first king

a question not worth discussing was Horaoe’s

stated by Bbckh (Manetho, p. 193) in
Orelli’s note on this passage. The late Mr-
Gutzlafl: in his History of Chim, tells us
how ‘⁴ the wise prince Te-ke'’ was chonen
successor to the throne ‘⁴ by the unanimous

opinion, and with the means we have of de·

be held now. On what authority Inachus
is said to have been contemporary with
Joseph I do not know, but so 1 find it is

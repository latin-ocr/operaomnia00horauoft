HORATII FLAGGI

Abdiderint furtim terris, et imagine cerea

Largior arserit igniS‚ et ut non testis inultus

Horruerim voces Furiarum et facta duarum : 4⁵
Nam displosa sonat quantum vesica pepedi

Diffissa nate ficus: at illae currere in urbem.

Canidiae dentes, altum Saganae caliendrum

Excidere atque herbas atque incantata lacertis

Vincula cum magno risuque jocoque videres. 50

43. cerea] ΤΙιε two last syllables co-
alesce. See S. 7. 30, n.

45. Furiarum] Horace calls the two
witches Furies, by a way of speaking com-
mon to all times since the decline of the
reverential feeling which made the Greeks
shrink from mentioning the name of thaee
σεμναὶ θεαί. Before Euripides no writer
would have made ao free with the name
of the Erinyes. He applies it ω Helen
(Orest. 1390, περγάμων· Ἀπολλωνίων

Ἐρινύ v) and to Medea (Μοᾱ.12ω),ἔεελ’
οἴκων τάλαιναν φοινιαν τ’ Ἐρινὺν ὑπ’
ἀλαστόρο ν.

48. caliendrum] This· is variously stated
w be a wig, οι· a cap, or some ornament for
the head. The etymology is uncertm'n. 1
have supposed the most ridiculum of the
above articles ω be meant.

50. Vincula] These· may mean love-
knots or long grass woven into chains for
refractory and faithless lovers.

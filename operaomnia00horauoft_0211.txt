vary. ‘Fore enim' is an elliptical form of
the obliqua orah‘o, in 1803101108 which
‘they said,’ or ‘they knew,’ must be sup-
plied. ‘Pretium’ has reference to the cor-

14. Portas vir Macedo] Plutarch, in
his life of Paulus Aemilius (c. xii.,) says it
was Philip s 80111, not Philip, that won the
cities os Greece. And Cicero (ad Att. i. 16)
says,⁸ ‘Nunc est expectatio comitiorum: in
qua omnibus invitis tradit noster Magnus
Auli filium3 atque in 00 neque auctoritate
neque gratia pugnat, sed quibus Philippus
omnia expugnavisse dicebat 111 quae modo

15. munero navium Saevos illaqueant
ducem] This' 13 supposedto refer to Menas,
otherwise called Menodorus, the commender
of Sex. Pompeius¹ fleet, who desei-ted from
him to Augustus and back to Pompeius,
and then to Aug-ustus again. He was re-
warded beyond his merits. He was aii-eed-
man of Cn. Pompeius, and Suetonius (octav.
74) statasthatAugustus made him ‘inge-
nuus:' “Valerius Messalla tradit neminem
unquam libertorum adhibitum ab eo (Octa-
viano) coenae excepto Mena, sed adserto in
ingenuitatem post proditam Sex. Pompeii
classem.” And Appian, iu his seventeenth
book (quoted by casaubon on Suet. l. 0.),
says, Μηνόδωρον ἐλθόντα ἐλεύθερον εύθῦς
ἁπεφῆνεν ἀντ’ ἁνελευθέρ ου. It should be
observed, however, that 0 111011 0011111 only

all thege emperor could do was to confer the
rights of ⁸ ingenuitas,’ which was sometimes
done (see art. ⁸Ingenuus,' Smith's Diet.
Ant.). According ω Servius, Vix-gil ‘
him his reward (Aen. vi. 612, sqq.):

 

⁸⁸ Quique arma secuti
Impia nec veriti dominorum fallere dextras,
Inclusi poenam expectant.”

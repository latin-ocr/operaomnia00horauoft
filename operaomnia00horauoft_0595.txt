EPISTLE III.
ΛΑΜ). 7:34. 3⁶ ὶο

Ῑιι asne. 734 an embassy came from Armenia to Rome, exproesing the dissafisfaction
oftha peoplewiththeirkingArtaxiu,and praying thatAugustuswouldplaceuponthe
flamm that king's younger brother Tigranes,who was then living in exile at Rome.
Augustus mented, and sent 'liberius with 'figi-anes to dethrone Artaxias. This 'minius
did, md with his own hand aowned 'ligr-anes. Suetonius (vit. Tib. c. u) speaks os him
as lmding his army through Macedonia into Syria, which partly corresponds with
Horace's inquiries; hut as to Syria there must be a mistake3 it would be entirely out
of the way. This summary proceeding was made the most of at Rome, though there
appears to havebeen little raeisumoe. There was a medal struck on the naasion, with the
insu-iption “Armenia aptas Horace speaks below (Ep. 12. 26) of the Armenian having
fnum by the valour of Tiberium and Velleius, the court gazetteer, says Armenia was on
ffiatoccaaionreducedto the power of theRomans. It had been sovirtuallysince the
submissim of Tigranes’ grandfather to Cn. Pompeius.

About his person Tiberius appears to have had a number of young men, such as Titius,
Celsus, and Munatius, mentioned in this Epistle, and Julius Florus, to whom it is ad-
dresaed. What little can be said about the three firstwillbe foundinthenotes. Of
Florus Porphyrion says, “ Fuit satirarum scriptor cujus sunt electae ex Ennio, Lucilio,
Varrone? hom this Epistle (v. 23) wc inferthat he was practising to become an orator
oraimisconsultus, andthathe wrote verses ofthe noster sort3 and inthe second Epistle
of the second book (v. 59) we have the same insormation.

“ Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis3
Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro.”

He may have written Satires, but it would seem from the last quotation that he had not
written any when Horace sent him that Epistle. If the Scholiast is to be trusted (and it
is not likely he invented what he says), Florus published a selection from the old writers
mentionedby Porphyrion. Quintilian (Inst. Orat. x. 3) tells an anecdote of one Julius
Florus, who was uncle to an intimate friend of his, Julius Secundus, and whom he calls
⁸⁸ in eloquentia Galliarum (quoniam ibi demum exercuit eam) princeps.” This may be
the person Horace addresses, and if so he carried out succaesfully the pursuit of which
Horace here supposes him to be beginning the practice. He is alsosupposed byWeichert
to he the person mentioned by Tacitus (Ann- iii. 40, 42) as the leader of an insurrection
of the Treviri, which is very improbable. How he got the gentilician name Julius is uncer-
'nm- The cognomen Florus belonged to the Aquillia gens; and there was a L. Aquillius
Florus, one os the ‘ triumviri monetales’ at this time, several of whose coins are amnt.
Some of them are given in the Dict. Biog. It is supposed he received the ‘ civitas ' from
Julius Caesar and took his name. But we know nothing about this. Horace had a great
regard for him, as appears not only from this but the other Episfle, in which he makes
his excuses to him for not having sent him any poetry.

Florus was evidently a young man at this time, and all the persons named were young.
One of them (Celsus) was secretary to Tiberius. whether the others had any definite
occupation, or were merely travelling to enlarge their experience and see the world, is not
stated. Horace assumes that they are not wasting their time, but pursuing their studies
and practising their pens. He inquires aster his young friends in a way that shows his
interest in them, offers them such advice and encouragement as he thinks they need, and
especiallybegsFlorustobe reconciled to Munatius,withwhomhehadfor some reason
quarrelled. This was probably Horace’s chief doeign in writing this Epistle.

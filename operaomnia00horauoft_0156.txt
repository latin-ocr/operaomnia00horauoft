HORATII FLAGGI

Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum. Te J ovis impio
Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit volucrisque Fati

Tardavit alas, cum populus frequens

Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum: .
Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium

Custos virorum. Reddere victimas
Aedemque votivam memento ε

Nos humilem feriemus agnam.

21. Utrumque nostrum] Persius (v. 45.
51) has repeated and expounded Horace' s

nu

“Non equidem hoc dubites amborum foe-
dere certo

Consentire dies et ab uno sidere duci.

Nostra vel aequali suspendit tempora Libra

Parca tenax veri, seu nata fidelibus hora

Dividit in Geminos concordia fata duorum,

Saturnumque gravem nostro Jove frau-
gimus una,

Nescio quod certe 881 quod me tibi tem·
perat astrum?

is doubtful whether Saturno' be governed
by‘ refulgens’ or ‘eripuit.1 Bentley takes

bable epithet, 83 13 C. iii 29. 53.

28. Sustulerat,] The use of the indi-
cative in hypothetical 83383 of this kind
is not easily reduced to rule; but it
seems to correspoud to the Greek construc-
tion of ἂν with the indicative. When the
condition is not fulfillod, or is a negative
condition, or implies 3 negation, then the
consequent clause may be expressed by the
indicative mood. in the pluperfect tense if
the action be 3 complete action and past, in
the perfect if it be present. “Sustulerat si
non levasset: sed levavit.” See Wagner on
Aen. ii. 55. See also his note on‘Aen. iv.

Professor Key (1..G.1214, sqq.) saysthnt
the apparent exceptions to the rule that 13
83811 cases 83 this the subjunctive· 18 required
in both 8183303, are to be explained sor the
most part by the 8811183883 being elliptioel.
He also quotes this passage, and explains it

words thus. H⁴⁶oraoe a tnnk down gli-{ing

cult to put into words the 31 of a con-
ventional expression. Mr. Ke 8 judgmeut
always commands but 11118 exp h-
nation is hardly satisfactory ,1 think, though
it is more easy to feel the force of 1118 8011-
struction than to explain it. It is common
13 031· own language, in which Horace’ 8
meaning might be thus e “ the
trunk had killed me, had not Faun'us light-
ened the blow. ” Mr. Key 811118 13 a note»

Horace was under 1118 particular care of
Mercury, the Muses, and Faunus, 1ο euch
ofwhom, aswellas to Liber (111. 8. 7), he
attributes his preservation 03 this memor·
able occasion (C. iii. 4. 27). Faunus or
Pan was the son of Hermes or Mei-cury.

224 HORATII FLAGCI

received probably with so much favour as to draw forth this ode. That is at any rate a v

reasonable way of determining its date, which otherwise must remain wholly unknown.
The ode has all the appearance of genuine feeling, and shows how much Horace had suf-
fered from the vexatious detractions that at one time he was subject to. Sanadon
declares it is “ perfectly beautiful,’' and Dacier says ⁴¹ rien de plus achev6,” nothing more
finished, is to be found in the Greek or Latin language. Julius Scaliger would rather
have written it than have been king “ totius Tarraconensis.'’ I confess there is no ode that
strikes me as more terse or more elegantly written than this. It is much less artificial
than the first ode of the first book with *which it is usually compared.

ARGUMENT.

He on whom thou lookest at his birth, Melpomene, derives his fame, not stom the gameS,
or from triumphs, but from the streams and woods of Tibur inspiring him with Aeolian
song. They have named me the tuner of the Roman lyre, and envy assaults me no
longer as it did ; and to thee 1 owe this gift of pleasing, Ο Muse, who rulest the eheu,
and art able to give the music os the swan to the voioeless fish if thou wilt.

QUEM tu, Melpomene, semel
N ascentem placido lumine videris,
Illum non labor Isthmius
Glarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico 5
Victorem, neque res bellica Deliis
Ornatum foliis ducem,
Quod regum tumidas contuderit minas,
Ostendet Capitolio:
Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt lo
Et spissae nemorum comae
Fingent Aeolio carmine nobilem.
Romae principis urbium
Dignatur suboles inter amabiles .
Vatum ponere me choros, 15
Et jam dente minus mordeor invido.
O, testudinis aureae
Dulcem quae strepitum, Pieri, temperas,
Ο mutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cycni, si libeat, sonum, 20

4. clarabit] This word occurs no where
else in this sense Ι believe. ‘ Deliis foliis’
is another way of expressing ‘ laurea Apol·
linari‚' ⁴ Delphica lauro.' As to ⁴ Aeolio
carmine,' see C. iii. 30. 13, n. ‘Testudinis
aureae ⁹ is Pindar’s χρυσέας φόρμιγγος

18. Pieri] This singular is not common.
Ovid uses it (Fast. iv. 222): “ Pieris orsa
loqui.''

19. mutis—piscibus] The Greek ἔλλο-
πας ἰχθῦς is thus explained by some, but
the meaning of that word is doubtful.

22. monstror diyito] Pers. (1. 28), “At
pulchrum est digito monstrari et dicier hio
est.’' In Epp. i. 19. 32, he calls himself
“Latinus fidicen.” ‘ Quod spiro' means
that 1 breathe the breath, not of life, but
of poetry. Compare C. iv. 6. 29: ‘⁶ Spiri-
tum Phoebus mihi—dedit.’' Ovid (Trist. iv.
10. 115) says, it is true,

“ Ergo quod vivo durisque laboribus obsto
Gratia, Musa, tibi ;’'

but ⁴ vivo ’ does not represent ⁸ spiro!

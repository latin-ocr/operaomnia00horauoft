CARMINUM 1. 28. 63

appealtohiajudgmantiu v. umbos been proposed to alter ‘te' into ‘me’ or ‘se,'
though most even of those who divide the colloquy at v. 6 have overlooked this difficulty,
and accepted ⁸ te ' onthe authority of the MSS. But ⁴ nauta ’ is not properly a common
aailor, but ‘naviculariusl a shipmaster. “Nautam accipere debemus eum qui navem exercet.
. Quamvis nautae appellantur omnes qui navis navigandae causa in nave sunt, sed de exer-
citare solummodo Praetor sentit ’' (Dig. 4. 9. l. 5 2). The ⁴ exercitor' is the person
who chum the ship. There does not seem to be any natural division at v. 16, and for
Archyta· to begin (at v. 21) with ⁴ Me quoque devexi,' &c., nothing having gone before
with which to connect those worda, is also unnaturah while, if we understand him to
hegin his reply at ⁸ Sed omnes una manet nox,' we have an opposition between the
sare-sm of the first speaker (who says ironieally of those that aspired to connexion with
thegoda and to the highest orderof wisdomthattheyhndnotoeoepeddeath,noteven
Pytlngom, though he pretended to have done ao once) and the grave truth, solemnly
propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, wise and unwise, old and young, on
land or at sea, and inustrated by his own case. This was once my opinion, and as many
will still adhere to the theory of the dialogue and Archytas’ shipwreck, 1 have put that
theory in what appears to me the best form. The other explanation of the ode, however,
'I feel little doubt, is in the main the true one. Another to which Orelli inclined (though
he suspended his judgment on the whole question) supposes a sailor coasting along the
Apuliau shore and aeeing the tomb of Archytas, whereupon he breaks out into the
address ‘Te maris,' δια, from v. 1 to 20. Then the ghost of a latdy shipwrecked man
comes fumi-d aud prays for a little saud. lt would be difficolt to imagine any circum-
stances that could have suggested such a scene, especially with so abrupt a change of
persona. The sudden apparition of a ghost echoing back to the marinei- at sea his own
worda ιο my mind appears almost ludicrous.

ARGUMENT.

ἓν Even thee, thou measurer of earth and sea, thou counter of the sanda, Archytas, howsmall
“ a portion of earth contains thee now! It profits thee not to have searched the air and
taven-sed the heavens since thou wert ιο die. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and mnes have
died,andPythagoraatoowithall hislearninghathgone downonce moretothegrave.
'Buteo itis: all must die alike3 some to make sport for Mars, some swallowed up in
the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave: noue escape: 1 too haveperished
in the ναίετε. Βιιι grudge me not, thou mariner, a handful of earth: so may the stom
speud itself on the woods while thou art safe and thy merchandize inmensa. Is it a
small matter with thee ιο bring ruin on thy children? Yea, perhaps retribution awaits
thyaelf : my cursen will be heard, and then no atonement shall deliver thee. ”fis but
the work of a moment—thrice cast earth upon me and hasten on. .

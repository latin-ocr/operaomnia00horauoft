HORATII FLAGGI

Garrulus atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

Scribendi recte : nam ut multum nil moror.
Crispinus minimo me provocat:
Accipiam tabulam detur nobis locus, hora,

Ecce,
‘⁶ Accipe, si vis

Gustodes3 videamus uter plus scribere possit.”
‘⁴ Di bene fecerunt inopis me quodque pusilli v
Finxerunt animi, raro et perpauca loquentis.

prehends defects of taste as well as style.
“Erat quod tollere velles ’' is oddly inter-
preted by the Scholiasts “ex quibus sunt
nonnulla quae velis inde excerpere et pro
tuis habere '' (Porph.). ‘⁴ Erat quod velles
imitari'’ (Acron). Cruquius’ Scholiast gives
the same interpretation. Heindorf adopts
that notion‚ which would not otherwise
have been noticed here. Quintilian did not
so understand the words when, differing
with Horace he says (x. 1. 93): “Ab
Horatio dissentio, qui Lucilium fluere lutu-
lentum et esse aliquid quod tollere possis
putat‚'' where he uses the word ‘ possis*
for ¹ velles‚’ quoting from memory. Horace’s
word ‘ velles ’ fixes the meaning of ¹ tollere '
‘ to remove,’ even if the whole context did
not do so. ⁴ You would wish for the credit
of the author to remove it!

12. piqer scribendi serre labor-ena]
⁶ Piger ferre ' is aGreek construction common
in the odeS, but not so in the language of
the Satires. (See C. i. 1. 18, ιι.) Ιιι C. iv.
14. 22, we have ‘impiger' in the same
construction :
turmas.''

14. Crispinus minimo] See S. i. 1. 120,ιι.
‘Minimo me provocat’ Porphyrion inter-
prets thus: “Sensus ex proverbiali con-
suetudine duetus3 solemus enim dicere
minimo me digito provocat cum volumus
quem intelligi tantum valere minimo digito
quantum alius toti's viribus.” Acron and
Comm. Cruq. have the same idle talk. The
proverb is probably their own invention.
Erasmus, however, in his book of Proverbs,
takes it up as meaning a contemptuous sort
of challenge3 and Lambinus also follows
the Scholiasts ε Cruquius does not. Bentley
quotes a Scholium which gives the right
sense. ‘¹ Minimo provocare dicunturii qui
in responsione (sponsione) plus ipsi per-
mittant (promittant) quam exigant ab ad
versario.'’ ‘ He offers me the greatest
odds’ is the meaning according to this
interpretation, which Bentley adopts, as far
as concems the wager, but substitutes as
his own conjecture‘ nummo ’‘for miuimoss

“ Impiger hostium vexare

as signifying that Crispinus was so poor he
could only stake a sestertius. Ι (10 not see
any point in such an allusion to the man’s
poverty. His confideuce of victory 'is the
matter Horace means to illustrate. The
MSS. are unanimous in favour of ‘ minimo,'
and the Scholiasts and editors are equally
so ; and, if that reading be right, the inter-
pretation above given inust be right too.
I do not see the connexion between this
passage and ‘nummo te addicere' (S. ii.
5. 109), which Bentley quotes in sup-
port of his alteration, and on the strength
of which Orelli considers it a plausible con-
jecture.

15. Accipiam tabula-35] Here Bentley
follows the reading of some MSS. which
have ‘ accipe] 'am‚ ' and he cannot help won-
dering that neni-ly all the editors should
have taken up‘ accipiam-⁹ jam 'he thinks
exhibits the eagerness of the*¹ challenger, and
his sear lest Horace, if he let him go on
this occasion, should slip out of the contest
altogether. For all this the passage affords
no warrant. There is no or
haste,—nothing more than a polite chal-
lenge to see which could write most verses
in a given time. ‘'rake tablets if yon
please, and I will take them too! The
omission of the persona] pronoun to ex-
press antithesis is nothing in familiar talk
where there could be no gmistuke. ‘Cus-
todes' are umpires to see there is no foul

binus, against all the MSS„ introduced the
reading ‘floquentem which Bentley has
adop ted, and others after him. There-
ceived reading is very natural, and 1 see no
occasion for altering it. ‘The gods have
done me a kindness in making me of a poor

Iam-

⁴ and unpretending disposition that speaks
' but seldom, and very little at a time! This

is intelligible. It is Horace’s reply to the
challenge, which he declines.

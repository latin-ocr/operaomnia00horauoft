CARMEN XV.

About A. U. c. 726.

When Augustus had brought the civil wars to nn end, A.u.c. 725, he applied himself
to the reformation of manners, and Horace probably wrote this and other odes (ii. 18.
iii. 1—6) to promote the reforms of Augustus ; perhaps by his desire or that of Maecenas.
They werenllprobably written between A.u.c. 725 and 728, and they should be read
together, md with C. i. 2. From the reference to the temples in the last staua, it may
be mumed perhaps that this ode and iii. 6. 1 were written about the same time, that is,
in 726, when Augustus set himself particularly to restore the public buildings. The
authorities on the subject are Suetonius (Vita Octsv. 30), Dion (53. 1, 2), and Velleius
(2. 89), and the Monumentum Ancymnnm.

Augustus passed several snmptuury lawa to keep down the expensive habits of the rich
«itineris, regulating in particular the eost of festivals and banquets. But they soon feu

- into diense and contempt, as Tiberius, writing to the senate fisty years afterwards,

dedared: ‘⁴ Tot a majoribus refertae leges, tot quas divus Augustus tulit, illae oblivione,
hae, quod flagitiosius est, contemptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere '' (Tac. Anu. iii.
54). For en account of the ⁴ Sumptuariae legen ’ passed by Augustus, see Aul. Gen. ii.
24, and smith’s Dict. Antiqq.

ARGUMENT.

'rho rich man’s palmes und flower-gurdens and ponds are occupying all our once fertile
land, This was not the way of our anoestors, who had but little while the state was
rich; who dwelt in no spacions house33 whom the law bade content themselves with a
turf-roofed cottage, and beautify the towns and temples with marble.

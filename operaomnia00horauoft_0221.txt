Aa well rob the lienem of her whelps‚ Pyrrhus. That- girl will rush to the rescae of her
-lover, and like a coward and thief thou shalt quit the field aster a hard-fought battle,

in which he shall stand like Nireus or Ganymede, the umpire of the fight.

N on vides quanto moveas periclo,
Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos leaenae?
Dura post paullo fugies inaudax

Cum per obstantes juvenum catervas 5
Ibit insignem repetens Nearchum,
Grande certamen tibi praeda cedat

Major an illi.

Interim, dum tu celeres sagittas
Promis, haec dentes acuit timendos, 10
Arbiter pugnae posuisse nudo

Sub pede palmam

Fertur, et leni recreare vento
α Sparsum odoratis humerum capillis,
Qualis aut Nireus fuit aut aquosa 15

it ran πότερα ἡ λεῖα σοὶ μείζων ἥξει ἦ
ἐκείνῃ. where μείζων would be equivalent,
mtto λειας μεῖζον μέρος, but to μᾶλλον.
Cicero (ad Qu. Fratr. iv. 13) says, “Sit
lictor non suae sed tuae lenitatis apparitor-3
*qim-aque praeferant fasoes illi ac secures

bably Horace found μείζων in the ori-

pretty literal copy, and indicates a compon-

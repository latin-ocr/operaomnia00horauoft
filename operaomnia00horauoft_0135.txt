ha did not know or care whetheritwasa
mountain or a river. However this may be,
there can be no doubt Niphates was a moun-
tain-range east of the Tigris. The name
means the snow-mountain. Perhaps a part
of it may have been covered with
snow. Strabo (p. 529, Ed. Cas.) makes the
'ligris rise in the Niphates. This fact may
account for the confusion that existed be-
tween mountain and river. Τ11ο successes of
Augustus in Armeniawere in ΛΑΜ). 734, and
the geographica! question therefore is chiefly
of interest here in a chronological point of
viewz but even that interest vanishes, if we
suppose Horace to be speaking of conquesta
to come, as he does in C. i. 12. 53, sqq. We
may then admit that Horace wrote of the
conquest of Armenia even five years before
any successes were gained there.

flowed into the Araxes, near Persepolis, but
it was a small stream, and probably unknown
to Horace. He cannot alludeto this, as some
suppose. lambinus, however, thinks he
means this river, and says the expression is

22. vertieee,] Heinsius on Aen. i. 117,
states that the Medioean MS. always has
the reading ¹ vertex,' not ⁴ vortex.¹ The
MSS. and editions vary in this pmage, and
Forcellini says that ‘ vertex ' and ‘ vortex ’
are written indiseriminately in the MSS. of
all the Latin authors. Fea adopts ¹ vertices,’
but with it Charisius’ absurd etymology,
“vertex a vertendo dicitur: vortex a vo-
rando.” sse from Quintilian,
quoted by Forcell„ shows how ‘ vertex '

into its derived meanings.

23. Gelonos] This was one of the tribes
on the north bank of the Danube. See note

ou 21, and C. i. 19. lo, n. About the same ⁷

time, it is supposed, with Augustus’ expedi-
tion against the Cantabri, Lentulus drove the
Transdannbian tribes across the river (see
C. iii. 8, Introduction). But whether this is

alluded to here must be matter of doubt.

CARMEN X.

Heinius Murena, or A. Terentius Varro Murena, as he was called aster his adoption by
A. Terentius Varro, was apparently a man of restless and ambitious character, aud, as we
have seen, paid the penalty of his rashnoes with his life (C. ii. 2, Introduction). It is
very prohable that Horace wrote this ode to his friend to warn him of the tendeneies of
his disposition. All else that we leam from Horace's poenis respecting Murena is that he
was of the college of augurs (C. iii. 19), and that he had a house at Formiae, where he
received Maecena and his party on their way to Brundusium (S. i. 5. 37, sq.). As
uniens was put ιο death A.u.c. 732, this ode must have been written before that year.

.' Although it may be inserted from the tone of this ode that Murena was not incapable
of theconduct imputed to him and ou the charge of which he died, it is but fairto him to say
that his guilt does not appear to have been proved. Dion (54. 1. 3) says that, “iu the
year when M. Marcellus and L. Arruntius were consuls, Fannius Caepio headed a con-

spiracy, which was joined by others3 and Murena was said ιο have entered into it with
them, either truzy or standerously. The conspirators did not appear to take their trial,

and were condemned 111 their absence, but were taken and put to death shortly asterwards.
Proculeius, his brother, and Maecenas, who had married his sister, were unable to obtain
Murena’s pardon.'' Τ1ιε same historisn charges him with ungovernable and indis-
<nimiusve rashness of speech ι ἀκράτῳ καὶ κατακορεῑ παρῤησίᾳ πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως
ἔχρῆτο (54. 3).

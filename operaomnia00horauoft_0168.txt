Somnum reducent.

HORATII FLAGGI

Somnus agrestium

Lenis virorum non humiles domos
Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
Non Zephyris agitata Tempe.

Desiderantem quod satis est neque

25

Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,
Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis
Impetus aut orientis Haedi,
Non verberatae grandine vineae

Fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas

30

Culpante nunc torrentia agros
Sidera nunc hiemes iniquas.
Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt
J actis in altum molibus ; huc frequens

Gaementa demittit redemptor

Cum famulis dominusque terrae

⁴elaborarunt,' as referring to Damocles.
But the future has most authority, and
Horace is laying down a maxim, not relat-
ing a fact. Cic. (Tuae. Disp. v. 21) tells
the story of Damocles with reflections simi-
lar to these. Compare Persius (iii. 40) :—

⁴⁴ Auratis pendens laquearibus ensis
Purpureas subter cervices terruit.”

20. Non avium] Seneca (de Provid. iii.),
quoted by Dillenbr.‚ says that Maecenas
sought sleep by the help of distant music.
Aviaries were not uncommon in the houses
of the rich.

21. Somnus ‹lyr-estium] Acron and Por·
phyrion, whom Dillenbr. follows, make
⁴ agrestium viromm’ dependent on ⁴ Somnusss
which destroys the prosopopoeia. Dillenbr.‚
in his Quaestiones Horatianae, has drawn
particular attention to the alternate arrange-
ment of the epitheta in this passage among
many others. He gives several instances,
and they are numerous enough to consti-
tute a feature in Horace’s style. ⁴⁴ Spiritum
Graiae tenuem Camoenae,'’ is one instance
out of many. It is said to ariae out of the
liking the Latin poets had for homoeote-
leuton.

27. Arcturi cadentis—orientis Haedi,]
Arcturus sets the beginning of November.
The constellation Auriga, of which the kids
(two stars) form a part, rises the beginning
of October.

29. verberatae yrandine vineae] See
Epp. i. 8. 4: “Grando contundet vitosss’

‘Mendax fundus' is like “spem mentita
seges' ’.(Epp i. 7. 87), and opposedto⁴⁴ sege-
tiscerta fides’' (C. iii. 16. 30). Astheolive-

tree complains of the rain, so Gesner would
have the field abuse tho drought and the
storm, putting ⁴ agro’ for ‘agr-ool and aup-
posingthefinal ‘s’ to have ariaen out of
the first letter of the following word ⁴ sidera!
⁴ Arbore’ means chiefly perhaps the olive.
There is no variation in the MSS„ nor has
any other emendation but Gesner’s been,
aa... &sawt ¹³0 aaz
tree complaining of the exo-{esim rain, or
the star that burns the fields, or the ‹ri-uel
swrm. If the reading be correct, the verses
are not among Horaoe's happioet. But unt
is no reason for alterin'g or abandoniugthem.

32. eontracta paces aequora amnne]
Compare C. ii. 18. 20,—

“Marisque Baiis obstrepentis urges

Summovere littora3’
and Epp. 'i. 1. 84, -
“Si dixit dives, lacus et mare sentit amorem
Festinantis heri, cui si vitiosa libido
Fecerit auspicium, eras ferramenta Tea-
num
Tolletis, fabri?
35. Caementa demittit redemptor] eom-
pare C. iii. 24. 3, sq. .-

“Caementis licet occupes
Tyrrhenum omne tuis etmareApulicum.”

The walls were faoed on either side with
stone, and loose stones (caementa) were
thrown in between. ⁴ Frequens ' goes with
‘cum famulis: according to Doering, and
meana ‘cum frequenti famulorum tua-bn!

Others say it means ⁴ frequenter! 1 ἛΚ

it means this, or‘ many a redemptor.

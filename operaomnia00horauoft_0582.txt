HORATII FLACGI

Quanto devites animi capitisque labore.

Impiger extremos curris mercator ad Indos,

-45

Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes:
Ne cures ea quae stulte miraris et optas
Discere, et audire, et meliori credere non vis?
Quis circum pagos et circum compita pugnax

Magna coronari contemnat Olympia, cui spes,

50

Oui sit condicio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?
Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.
“ Ο cives, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est3

Virtus post nummos.''

44. capitisque labora] ⁴ Caput ’ is here
put for the whole body. We do not use it
so, but for the seat of intelligence, which the
Romans placed in the heart, not in the
hrain. On ‘ per saxa, per ignes,' see C. iv.
14. 243 S. ii. 3. 56.

47. Ne cures ea] ‘In order that you
may cease to care for those things which
you now so foolishly admire and long for,
will you not learn and listen, and trust the
experience of a better man than yourself.’

49. Quis circum payos] Suetonius says
of Augustus (vit. c. 45) that he was very
fond of observing boxers, “et maxime
Latinos: non legitimos atque ordinarios
modo sed et catervarios oppidanos inter an-
gustias vicorum pugnantes temere ac sine
arte.’' These latter are what Horace
alludes to: boxers who went about the
streets and the country villages and fought
for the amusement of the inhabitants and
for what they could pick up. Horace does
not merely mean what took place at the
Paganalia and Compitalia but frequently.
‘Coronari Olympia' is a Greek way of
speaking. Horace says, what boxel· who
goes about the country towns exhibiting
would despise the Olympic prizes if he had
a hope, still more a promise, that he should
be crowned without a struggle? By this
he means, men strive after happiness in the
shape of riches, &c.; but if they win learn
wisdom‚ that shall give them all they can
desire without trouble or pain. The world
may judge otherwise, he proceeds to say,
and make wealth the standard of worth;
but the world is not to be listened to, it is
foolish and inconsistent. ⁴ Sine pulvere'
seems to be taken from the Greek ἀκονιτί.

54. ,Ταηαε nummus ab imo] See S. ii.
3. 18. Most modern editions have ‘ pro-
docet,’ which appears, in good MSS.‚ but
was first edited by Lambinus. The word

Haec J anus summus ab imo
Perdocet, haec recinunt juvenes dictata senesque,

55

does not occur elsewhere. The Greeks
used προδιδάσκειν, as Demos. p. 1231. 263
Soph. Aj. 1633 Trach. 681, and elsewhere.
It signifies ⁸ to warn,’ ⁴ to teach beforehand!
Lambinus, Doering, Fea, and others, ex-
plain ‘ prodocet ' by ἐκδιδάσκει, i. e. ‘ pub-
lice, palam docet! Ven. 1483 has ‘prae-
docet‚' and many old editions and some
MSS. have the same. The editio princeps
has ‘perdocet,’ and so had some of Cru- ⁴
quiusQMSS„ and all the editions of the
sixteenth century. It is defended by Tor-
rentius and H. Stephens (Diat. pp. 45‚127),
in whose time it was the vulgar reading.
I think it is the true one. ‘ Perdocet'
means it persists in teaching, it enforces.
Horace says that as gold is more precious
than silv er, virtue is more precious than gold3
whereas from one end of the Forum to
the other (not only by tho money-leaders,
as Orellisays) the opposite doctrine is in-
sisted upon, and old and young go there to
leam it, as boys going to school, and re-
peat it as school· boys repeat their tasks
dictated to them by the master. Verse 56
is repeated from S. i. 6. 74. Cunningham,
Sanadon, and others omit this verse, but
no MSS. omit it, and this is not the only
instance in which Horace repeats himself.
It heightens the force of the picture by.
representing the sort of lesson men· of au
ages are spending their lives on learning,
the casting up of accounts, as Gesner re·
marks. As to ‘dietata’ see S. i. lo. 75,
n. Plato (Rep. iii. p. 407, Stept.) quotes
a verse of Phocylides (Bergk. Poet. Lyr.
Gr. p. 340), bidding men first seek the
means of subsistence and then practise
virtue when they have got them: δίζησθαι
βιοτὴν, ἀρετὴν δ’ ὅταν ᾖ βίος α’σκεῖνς
which shows that ‘ virtus post nummos ’ is
a very old rule as it is a very modern one.

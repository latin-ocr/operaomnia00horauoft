8 HORATII FLAGGI

than in connexion with those prodigies which seemed to speak the wrath of Heaven
against civil discord. Other poets wrote of these prodigies which were very notorious.
See Tibull. ii. Ξ. 71, sqq.; ovid, Met. xv. 782, sqq.; and one phenomenon poetically
described by Horace is recorded by Dion. (xlv. l7): καὶ ἰχθῦς ἐκ τῆς θαλάσ-
σης ἀμύθητοι κατὰ τὰς τοῦ Τιβέριδος ἐκβολὰς ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον ἐξέπεσον.

If this ode is read with C. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the Introduction to that
ode, the feeling with which Horace entered into the mission of Augustus as the reformor
will be better understood.

ARGUMEN T.

Portenta enough hath Jove sent upon the earth, making it afraid lest a new deluge
were coming, as the Tiber rolled back from its mouth threatening destruction to the
city, the unauthorized avenger of Ilia!

Our sous shall hear that citizens have whetted for each other the steel that should have
smitten the enemy.

What god shall we invoke to help us? What prayers shall move Vesta to pity? To
whom shall Jove assign the task of wiping out our guilt? Come thou, Apollo ; or thou,
smiling Venus, with mirth and love thy companions3 or thou, Mars, our founder, who
hast too long sported with war ς or do thou, son of Maia, put on the form of a man
and let us call thee the avenger of Caesam nor let our sins drive thee too soon away;
here take thy triumphs; be thou our father and our prince, and suffer not the Mede to
go unpunished whilst thou art our chief, O Caesar.

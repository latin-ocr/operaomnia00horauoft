HORATII FLACCI

ΤΕ maris et terrae numeroque carentis arenae
Mensorem cohibent, Archyta,

Pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
Munera, nec quidquam tibi prodest

Aerias tentasse domos animoque rotundum ' 5
Percurrisse polum morituro.

Occidit et Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum,
Tithonusque remotus in auras

Et J ovis arcanis Minos admissus, habentque

Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco

Demissum, quamvis clipeo Trojana refixo
Tempora testatus nihil ultra

Nervos atque cutem morti concesserat atrae,
J udice te non sordidus auctor

Naturae verique.

Sed omnes una manet nox

Et calcanda semel via leti:
Dant alios Furiae torvo spectacula Marti 3
Exitio est avidum mare nautis ;

1. Te maris et terrae] ‘’Te isemphatic,
as the abruptness of the opening requires.
ἅμμον μετρεῖν, κύματα μετρεῖν (Theoc.
xvi. 60), were proverbial expressions for
lost labour. See Pind. 01. 13. 46 and
Georg. ii. 104. sqq. :—

 

“neque enim numero comprendere

οιζὲιξῖἷζῖιῑ scire velit, Libyci velit aequoris

Digiti-gl quam multae Zephyro turbentur
arenae-

Atchimedes’ work ὁ ψαμμίτης, in which he
computes the grains of sand on the shores
of Sicily, was probably only looked upon
by his contemporaries as the production of
an ingenious dreamer, and may be alluded
to here. There is no reason to suppose
that Archytas ever attempted to solve any
such problem.

3. Pulveris eaeiyui —parva — Munera]
See Introduction. ‘Munus,' which seems
to contain the same clement as μοῖρα, may
be rendered as in the Argument. It is not
properly equivalent ιοι donum. ’

6. Ρενσαννίεεε polum] “Atque omne
immensum peragravit mente animoquess
Lucr. i. 75.

9. Minos] Called by Hom. (Odyss. xix.
149) Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής, the grandson
of him who became judge' ιιι Hades.

10. Panthoiden] The story alluded to
ia that of Pythagoras, who ιο prove his doc-

trine of metempsychods dedared that he
had been Euphorbus the son of Pandiona

who fell in the Trojan war. In support of ”

which he claimed as his own a ahiem hung
up in the temple of Juno at Argue, which
when taken down proved ιο have the nane ⁴
of Euphorbus engraved on it. The ιιοιιωι
translation that- 1 can give of what fol-
lows ‘ quamvis clipeo‚’ &c- is, ⁴ although, by
taking down the shield and testifying to the
season of the Trojan war, he provedtbat he
had surrendered nothing but hia dnewa and
his skin to death.’

ll. quamvis] “Tucim md tho hta
writers use ⁴ quamvis' with an indicative,
and m‘ce ver-26⁴ qumquam 'with a subj unc-
tive’' (Key’ s Gram. 1227, 1). note).
prose· -writers pf Horaoe' a time would not
use ‘quamvis' with an indicative, md he

uses the subjunctive where the case iz Ϊ
strictly hypothetical, as C. iv. 2. 39, οι· ¹

where it suits the men-e, as C. iv. 6. 7.,

14. Judice te] See Introduction.

HORATII FLAGOI

J urandasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras,

Nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes.

Sed tuus hic populuS‚ sapiens et justus in uuo,

Te nostris ducibus, te Graiis anteferendo‚

Cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque 20
Aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota suisque

Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit ;

Sic fautor veterum ut tabulas peccare vetantes

Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

is confirmed in part by Tiberius (Ann. iv.
38): “ Optimos quippe mortalium altissima
cupere. Sic Herculem et Liberum apud
Graecos, Quirinum apud nos deum numero
additos. Melius Augustum qui speraverit.”
During his life he desired to be aoeounted
the son of Apollo, and was represented on
coins in the character of that god playing
on a harp3 and Acron (on Epp. i. 3. 17)
says he set up a statue of himself in the
library on the Palatine in the dress and
likeness of Apollo. There is also a coin in
Patini’s collection representing him with
Jove’s ‘fulmenff But it may be assumed
that he was not worshipped in the city till
he was dead (when several temples were
erected to him, and his worship was regu-
larly established), and that the altars Ho-
race speaks of were those which were raised
in the provinces, like that below.

16. Jurandasque tuum per nomen] The
oldest Blandinian MS. and a very few others
have ‘numen‚' which Bentley defends in
his usual manner. ⁸ Nomen ’ is the reading
of all editions before his, and of most since.
He would also alter the text in Tac. (Anu.
i. 73), where it is said “Rubrio crimini
dabatur violatum perjurio nomen Augustiss’
He also quotes an altar inscription (Gruter,
p. 229): “Numini Augusti votum susceptum
a plebe Narbonensium in perpetuum,’' the
date of which was A.¹⁷.c. 764, while Au-
gustus was alive. Horace uses ‘ numen ' in
C. iv. 5. 35: “et Laribus tuum Miseebit
numen ;'' and Ovid constantly uses it in
the way of flattery. There can be no doubt
Horace might have written ‘ numen ' here,
but 1 do not see why he should not have
said ‘ nomen,' or why nearly all the copyists
should have substituted the latter less likely
word for the other, both in this place and
that of Tacitus above. The person who
swore by the altar laid his hand upon it and
invoked the name of the divinity to whom
it was consecrated. This act is represented
on a gem in Gorlacus’ collection, part ii.

17. Nil oriturum aliem] This is a re-
petition of C. iv. 2. 37:

“ Quo nihil majus meliusve terris
Fata donavere bonique divi
Nec dabunt.”

20. simili ratione modoque] This is the
third time Horace uses this combination.
See S. ii. 3. 266. 271. ’

23. Sic fautor veterum] Suetonium
commending the simplieity ‚of Augustus
style of language (c. 86),> adds t ‘⁶ cacozelos
et antiquarios, ut diverso genere vitiosos,
pari fastidio sprevit.’' Κσκὸζηλον significa

affectation of any kind (Quint. Inst. viii. 3). .

He would therefore, as Orelli says, be ple-sed
with these remarks of Horace.

24. Quas bis quinque viri santernum] .

111 A.u.c. 303, ten panici-ns were ap·
pointed, with absolute powers for one year,
to draw up a code of laws, of which the
greater part was finished in that year, and
engraved upon ten tables of ivory or bronze.

In the following year the deeemvirate *³1

was renewed, with the difference that three
plebeians were elected among them, and
two more tables were added. Tbese rables
contained the fundamental principles of
Roman law to the latest times. cicero
speaks with more respect than Horace does
of the language in which they were written
(de Rep. iv. 8): “ Admiror nec rerum solum,
In his

sed verborum etiam elegantiam.”

time, as observed before (S. 1.,6. 77, n.), μ

they were committed to memory by boys-at

sch0013 but before his death the practice ,
had oeased, probably because of the neh-ie ·
forms employed. He says: ‘⁸ discebamus ³

xn ut <tarmen necessarium ;'’ showing that
the word ¹ carmen' was used for any set

form in prose or verse. (See C. i. 2. 28, n.) ,ν
Elsewhere he recommends the XII Tables ,
to those who are given to antiquari-u ’·

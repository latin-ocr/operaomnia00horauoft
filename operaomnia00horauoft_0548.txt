518 HORATII

Sive Aquilo radit terras seu bruma nivalem

Interiore diem gyro trahit, ire necesse est.
Postmodo, quod mi obsit clare certumque locuto,
Luctandum in turba et facienda injuria tardis.

“ Quid vis, insane, et quas res agis 3⁹⁷ improbus urget

Iratis precibus ;

“ tu pulses omne quod obstat,

Ad Maecenatem memori si mente recurras 3''

Hoc juvat et melli est ; non mentiar.

Ventum est Esquilias aliena negotia centum

Per caput et circa saliunt latus.
Roscius orabat sibi adesses ad Puteal cras.”

26. Interiora diem qyro trahit,] Cicero
renders a line of Aratus respecting the
Cynosura, ‘⁴ Nam cursu interiore brevi
convertitur orbe ’' (De N. D. ii. 41). The
notion is that of the heavenly bodies moving
round a centre in a series of orbits of which
the diameters gradually diminish, and in
the winter solstice traversing the innermost
and shortest circle.

29. improbus urqet Irati8 precibus ;]
¹ Improbus’ means here ‘hot tempered‚'
and ‘precibus’ curses, as in Epod. v. 86.
⁴ Tu pulses’ is an angry way of speaking,
‘ are you the man to knock down every thing
in your way ς’ as in the next Satire (v. 40),
“ Tu, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior,
ultro Insectere.'' There is sai-casm in
‘ memori‚’ as if he was not likely to forget
his duty to the great man. He says he
feels an iuward pleasure at the testimony
thus borne to his intimacy with Maecenas:
so at least 1 understand the words ‘hoc
ἱὶἷῗὲζέἓῗ. „2333” itatem&
is the meaning. In v. 29 Ι have followed
the reading of all the best MSS. Bentley
and others have different readings. In a
few MSS. ‘ tibi ' has been inserted between
‘ quid' and ‘ vis‘ according to a common
formula3 and this has made it necessary to
alter ‘quas res’ into ‘quam rem,’ which
Bentley has done on his own authority3
but three of Torrentius' had “ quid tibi vis,
quas res agis, insane >'' ⁴ Si recurras
means in the hopes of getting back, to see
if you cau get back. See S. 5. 87, ιι.

32. atras—Esquilias] See S. i. 8, In-
troduction. The former character of the
place rs expressed by‘ atrasss gloomy. He
says directly he gets near Maecenas' house
he begins to remember a hundred different
commissions entrusted to him by his ac-
quaintance. They flit about him like a

body. It appears he had pressed Horace
to appear next day, probably as his sponsor,
at the Puteal Libonis. This was some sort
of building in the Forum Romanum, erected
by one of the Scribonia gens, and there-
fore called ⁴ Scribonianum.⁷ Aaron on this
passage calls it “locus Romae ad quem
veniebant foeneratores. Alii dicunt iu quo
tribunal solebat esse praetoris; '' aud Por-
phyrion on Epp. i 19. 8, “Forum puteal-
que Libonis Mandabo siccis,' ’,‘says ‘Sedes
praetoris fuit prope arcum Fabianum:
dictum quia a Libone illie primum tribunal
et subsellia collocata sint.'' That the place
or its neighbourhood was the reeort of
money -lenders appears from Ovid (Rem.
Am. 561). —

and Cicero (pro Sext. 8) speaks οίἰ ‘puteal
et foeneratorum greges. There are coins
of Scribonius Libo on the reverse of which
is an altar crowned, with the· 'ption
PUTEAI. 'scamma (see Dict. Biog.), which
leads some to affirm that the ‘ puteal ³ was
no more than an altar. The request of

' Roscius that Horace would be there before

the second honr, makes it appear as if his
business was not with the praetor, who did
not open his court till the third hour (see
S. i. 9. 35, ιι.). ΤΙιθ general opinion seems
to be, that whatever the building was the
praetor did sit in or near it. but this is
doubtful. If it was an enclosed place it
was open at the top, and took its name
from the stone enclosures built round wells.

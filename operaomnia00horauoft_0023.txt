sturm in whfflh he was nearly lost off Cape Palinums', on the western ‘

coast of Italy. When this happened nobody knows. Aster the publica·
tion of ψ three books of Odes, Horace seems to have ceased from that
style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other compositione we know

different friends, of which he published a volume probably in auc. 734
or ⁷35. He seems to have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-

’ phical writers, and to have got a good deal interested in them, and also
1 to have become a little tired of the world and disgusted with the
¹ jealousies his reputation created. His health did not improve as he got

older, and he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em-
peror’s new physician ³. By his advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary to be a good deal away

from Rome, especially in the autumn and winter ⁴.
In Luc. ¹737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Seculares, and Horace

was required tc writc an odc for the occasion, which hc did, and it hac

been poeserved. 'I'his circumstance, and the credit it brought him, may

·. have given his mind another leaning to Ode-writing, and have helped

him to produce the fourth book, a few pieces in which may have been

' written at any time. It is said that Augustus particularly desired
v Horace to publish another book of odes, in order that those he wrote
” upon the victories of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in ῃ
f it. ,The latter of these Odes was not written, I believe, till auc. ¹741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably

³4 published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The Odes of the
⁴ fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are

none in the three first books that sui-pass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of Drusus, and few superior to that which is addressed to
Lollius. The success of the three first books, and the 110110111- of being
chosen to compose the Ode at the Ludi Seculares, seem to have given

· him encouragement. There are no incidents in his life during the above
’ period recorded or alluded to in his poems. He lived five years after

 

the publication of the fourth book of odes, if the above date be correct,
” and during that time Ι think it probable he wrote the Epistles to Au-
,ᾗ gustus and Florus which· form the second book3 and having conceived
ᾗ( · the intention of writing a poem on the art and progress of poetry, he
⁴3⁸. wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which has
³ > been preserved among his works. The fragments of which that poem
’ ³ appears to be composed, and which some have vainly tried to reduce to
‘a consistent whole, may have been written earlier than I have supposed;

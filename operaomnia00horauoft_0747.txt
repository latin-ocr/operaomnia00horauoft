Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et audax
Pythias emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque dei Silenus alumni.

Ex noto fictum carmen sequar, ut sibi quivis

240

Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret
Ausus idem: tantum series junctumque pollet,
Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris.
Silvis deducti oeveant me judice Fauni,

Ne velut innati triviis ac paene forenses

245

Aut nimium teneris juvenentur versibus unquam,
Aut immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta;
Offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et res,
Nee, si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emptor,

Aequis accipiunt animis donantve corona.

240. Ea· noto fictum cumen requam]
‘Ex noto' (if 1 understand it right, but Ι
amuotsure)means ‘inordinarylanguage,’
sudi aa any man thinks he could write, but
not every man when he comes to try suc·
oeeds. for it is the connexion (see v. 48)
and udering of the words and incidents and

· illnshationsgthatgivessomuchcharmto

common language. ‘ Ex noto ' might mean
that the subject must be familiar. Tho
context to be sure is about words; but there
is uo depending ou the context in this poem,
the parts are so looser put together (see
Introduction).

244. Fauni,] SeeC. ii. 19. 4, ιι. Horace
atys thatthoeerough beingsintroduoed from
flue woods should not talk ss if they had been
born in the city and were lonngers in the Fo-
rum,or ' in love verses like a mawkish
yonfln but neither should low language be
put into their mouth, for thia is sure to

offeud the refined part of the audience, even
if the vulgar applaudit. ‘Juveuor'is a
word not found elsewhere: it is
fiom the Greek νεανιεύεσθαι. ‘Formses'
isusedasls'vyusoeitsix.46):‘ ‘Exeo
tempore (the censorship of Appius Claudius)

teger populus fautor et mltor bonorum,
aliud forensis factio tenebat, donec Q. Fabius
et P. Decius censores facti: et Fabius simul
concordiae mum, simul ne humillimorum
in manu comitia essent, omnem forensem
turbam excretam in quattuor tribus con-
jecit, urbanasque ess appellavit?

meaus‘ ingenui, 'those who were born free
and of lawful vedloek‚ since none others

were ‘inpaffiapotesm' Asto‘ doer'
seeS.i.6.ll5,n.

251. Syllaba lon-qa brevi] As to tho
‘iambus' see above, v. 79, sq. Horace
here calls it ‘poe ‹itu-sla rapid font, as
elsewhere (C. i. 16. 24) he speaks of ⁴ celeres
iambos! He says the rapidity of tho ssoot
caused the division of the verse into the
from ofatrimeter,whereas itwas a‘sena-
rius: having six distinct iambic feet. The
admission of a spondee in the odd fest,
he ssyS, was au aster invention, in order to
give more weight to the measure. What
he means by ‘non ita pridem’ is not very
clear. 1 suppose ha means comparatively
lately3 but the verses &Archilochus had
spondees in them. The history is· unt
very accurate. Horace has himself imi-
tatedthepureiambic memmium-blne-

SATIRARUM Ι. 7.

Pnoscmn Regis Rupili pus atque venenum

Hybrida quo pacto sit Persius ultus, opinor

Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.

Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat

Clazomenis, etiam lites cum Rege molestas, 5
Durus homo atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,

Confidens tumidusun adeo sermonis amari

Sisennae Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.

Ad Regem redeo.

³. Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus]
'flue apothecariae' and barbers' shops were
ΜΗ, eowded with idlers, who had
nothing to do but to gossip about the news
d the hom·- With the barbers it has been
ιο in au ages and countries. The Romans

“ were commonly afflicted with weakness of

the eyes, and this caused the apothecary to

' be as much mixed up with idlers as the

barber. In Plautus’ play, Amphitruo says
(iv. 1) he has been looking for Naucrates

And as the horsae of Jove were said to be
white, this proverb connects itself with an-
other in the Amphitruo (i. l. 297) :—

“.Mer Quo agis te? Sos. Domum. Mer.

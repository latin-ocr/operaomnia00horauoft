⁸ aula ’ Orelli quotes Eurip. (Alcest. 259) :

ἄγει μ’, ἄγει μέ τις, οὐχ ὀρᾷς; νεκύων ἐς
αὐλάν.
He does not allow ‘destinata' to be the
nominative agreeing with ‘ aula,' but makes
it an ablative agreeing with another ‘ aula'
understood. Dillenbr. takes it with ‘ fine!
Bentley conjectures ‘capacis’ for ‘ ra-
pacis,' a very flat substitution. He also
follows Servius (ou Virg. Aen. vi. 152) in
reading ‘ sede ' rather than ⁸ fine.’ Torren-
tius, and Lambinus, and Stephens had

CARMEN XIX.

This ode was perhaps composed at the time of the Liberalia, like the third elegy of the
fifth book of Ovid' s Tristia, but· m what year there are no means of detes-mining. Orelli
says it appears to be copied from a Greek poem, because it approaches the ehu-mer of
the dithyramb. Except' m the subject the resemblance does not strike me. If Horace
had written on purpose to show the impossibility of reaching the force and beauty ,of the
higher order of Greek lyrie poetry through the medium of his language, he could not have
succeeded better, and the ἐνθουσιασμός, ‘ fumrss &c., which some commentators proiess
to find in the ode, exist, I think, only in their own mistakeu conception of Horaoe’s mind
and writings. They create the inspiration they expect to find. The subject is as likely
to have been suggested by a Greek picture as a Greek poem, but neither hypothesis is
necessary. The scene is laid in the woods,

ἵν’ ὁ βακχωίτας

ἀεὶ Διόνυσος ἐμβατεύει

θείαις ἀμφιπολῶν τιθάναις (Soph. Oed. Col. 678, sqq.),
and the poet is supposed to come suddenly upon the party, consisting of Bacchus, with
his attendant nymphs, and the wild ereatures of the woods‚ all attending with admiration
to the god as he sings his own achievements. The poet is smitten with tenor, which
gives place to the inspiration of the divinity, in virtue of which he breaks out into echoeu
of all he had heard. I cannot persuade myself that in this style Horace felt that his
strength lay, or that he made any pretension to the afflatus which his admirere claim for
him. There is skill in the poem ς but the Greek fite is wanting, as we may easily con-

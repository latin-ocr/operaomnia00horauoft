Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere plumbum

Quam quae per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum?
Nempe inter varias nutritur silva columnas,
Laudaturque domus longos qua-e prospicit agros.
Naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret,

‘tesserae’ were laid. Most of the good

to represent the battle of Issus, which sur-

20. aqua tendit rumpere plumbum] The
nse of leaden pipes for conveying water is
referred to in an inscription containing an
edict of Augustus for the supply of water to
the town of Venafrum ι “ Quaeque aqua in
oppidum Venafrorum it, fluit, ducitur, 88111
aquam distribuere, discribere vendundi causa
..... jus potestatemve esse placet, dum
ne ea aqua quae ita distributa, discripta . .
erit aliter quam fistulis plumbeis d. t.
(nuuTAxar) ab rivo p. L. (ranas uum-
αοᾼαιΝτ-Α) ducatur.’' The use of such
pipes has been disputed. The above in-
scription sets the question at rest, and
Horace's ¹ plumbum ' means leaden pipes.
(The inscription also settles the question of
‘discribere' or ‘ describere) See A. P.
86, n.; C. ii. 13. 233 and Long's note on
Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 30, where part of the
above inscription is given.) Ovid also uses
the bursting of a leaden pipe to illustrate
the spurting of blood from a wound (Met.
iv. l22):

“ Non albter quam cum vitiato fistula
plum 0
Scinditur, et tenues stridente foramine
longe
Ejaculatur aquae, atque ictibus aera rum-
pit.''
Cisterns were called ‘castella,' and there
were three sorts : ⁴ publica,² which received
the water intended for public purposes3
‘ privata‚’ which were the common property
of several persons who clubbed together to
build it, and laid on pipes to conduct the
water to their ‘ castella domestica: the cis-
ter-ns they had in their own houses. These
pipes therefore intersected the whole city.
As mentioned before (S. i. 4. 37, 11.), those
who couldv not afford to have water laid 011

at their houses resorted to the ‘lacus’ or
public tanks erected for their convenience,
mostly by the liberality of individuale, in
several parts of the town. The pipes 11818
called ⁴ fistulae.’

21. trepidat cum murmure] Compare
C. ii. 3. ll: ‘⁴ obliquo laborat Lymphafugax
trepidare rivo.”

22. nutritur silva celantium] See note
on C. iii. 10. 5: “nemus Inter pulchra
satum tecta.’' Compare Tibullus (iii. 3. 15)=
“Et nemora in domibus 388108 imitantia
lucos.'' Shrubs and flowers were planted
in the ⁴ impluvium‚’ but more largely in the
⁴ peristylium,’ which was 811 open space at
the back part of the house, surrounded by
colonnades, and usually, like the ‘implu-
vium,’ having a cistern or fountain in the
middle.

24. Naturam expellaefitrca] This was
a common expression. Lambinus restored
it in a corrupt passage of Cicero (id Att.
xvi. 2): “sed quoniam fin-cille extrudimur
Brundisium cogitoss' where the common

reading was ‘furore illo! Iambinus quotes

Catullus (105):

“Mentula conatur Pimpleum scandere
Mffitffigfflis praecipitem ejiciunt ;”

and Aristophanes (Pax 635)=

where δικρὰ κεκράγματα 13 8 conceit for
eries that acted like a pitehfork to foss
peace out of the city. Lucian (Tim. 12)
has καὶ μόνον οὐχὶ δικράνοις με ἐξεώθει τῆς ·

Cicero says (Tusc. v. 27), referring to the
eagerness of Indian widows to be burnt
with their husband’ s body (8 fiction which
it appears he believed):‘ ‘nunquam naturam

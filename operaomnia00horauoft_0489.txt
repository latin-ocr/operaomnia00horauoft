nomed a friend (Fabius Gallus) to buy him some statu& to put* ιιι his library. He bought

bidsor them too, and wanted to have them3 for OEcero writoe,‘ ‘Velim maneat Damasippus

unus, θ’ by which he means, if Damasippuswillnot take them off his hands, he must look

'riam oen be little doubt that the Damasippus here mentioned is the person Horace intro-
duces in this Satire- Doering and other commentator-s, following Com. Cruq. (who says
‘⁴ consumpto per mercatum patrimonio ”), call him a ⁴ mercator? which it is plain he was

. not. Thathewasnotaregulartxaderisclearfiomthepeoplecallinghim‘Mercurialem'

(v. 25). The ‘ mercatores ⁹ were always under the protection of Mercury (⁴⁴ Mercu-iales
viri ”), and there would be nothing particular in the application of the word to Damaeip-
pus ifhe had not been merely a private person, who had turned hishand to trading. Why
Hm should have chosen this man as the mouth-piece of his Satire does not appear.
He says himself, it is true, that having ruined his own affairs he had nothing to do but to
attend to the affairs cfothers3 which Horace interprete to mean, that he had taken to
givingadvice when it was not asked (see v. 27, ιι.). But Horace may have had better
reasons for employing this man’s name, which we have no means of knowing. He may
have ruined himself and taken to cunt, as Horace here reproeents; but we know nothing
further about him.

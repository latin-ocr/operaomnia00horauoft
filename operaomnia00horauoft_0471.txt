inthe examples he quotes from Cicero's

Venua'n was formed in mmc- 463, the

Rammius Megellus and C. Junius Brutus
Buhulms were consuls (see clinton, F. H.).
Ἡιο town, which was on the borders of
Immi- and Apulia, belonged to the Sam-
nites, from whom it was taken by Q. Fabius.
(Sabelli was the name given by the Romans
to all the tn'boe which issued from the
Sabine stock, of whom the Samnites were
one. See Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. i. 91. )
Apulia and Lucania were, at the beginning
of this war, independexit states in close
alliance with the Samnitae; but aster the
first year they found it for their interest to
desert those allius and joined the Romans,
with whom they continued to unite their
foroes till the end of the war. Horace's
supposition that one or other ofthose statas
was meditating or carrying ou war with
Rome is not therefore strictly weuram but
they were always very doubtful allies, and

and it was not till the fall of Tarentum,

other southern states ‘of Italy, finally ac-
knowledged the supremacy of Rome, and
accepted their freedom from her. It was
in consequence of the commanding position
of Venusia, in reference to the three nations

of the Samnites, Apuliam, and Lucaniam,

the war with Pyrrhus. (See Niebuhr' s
Loetures, p. 508. Schmitz.) After their
reverse at the battle of Heraclea, A.u.c.
474, the remnant of their army retreated to
Venusia, and here many found refuge atter
the defeat of Cannae. There are very few
monuments of antiquity or ruins lest. at
Venosa. A marble bust plaoed upon a
column professes to be an ancient bust of
Horacc3 but its authenticity is more than
doubtful. Swinburne takes it to be the head
os a saint, but observes that the inhabitants
have not csnonized Horace as the Neapolitans
have Vir-gil„ Homoe commences this digres-
sion meaning to speak humbly of himself
as com with Lucilius, a Roman ‘equoe,’
and continues it perhaps from affection for
his native place, and to show that it had done
good service and was not to be doepised.
The quantity of the second syllable in
Venusinus Horace makes short here, and
in C. i. 28. 26. Juvenal lengthens it
(vi. 167): ‘¹ Malo Venusinam quam te, Cor-
nelia, mater Gracchorum,'' where, as here,
the humble inhabitant of Venusia is con-
trasted with the proud matron of Rome.
¹ Quo ne ’ (v. 37) is an unusual expression,
in which ⁴ quo ' is redundant.
39. Sed Ιιὶι· stilus haud petet ultro]
On this use of ‘sed' see C. iv. 4. 22, n.
‘Ultro ' means here wantonly, without pro·
vocation or cause. (See C. iv. 4. 51, ιι.)
sse MSS. vary as usual between ‘ destrin-
gere' and ‘distringere.’ See C. iii. l.
17, n. Orelli prefers ⁸ destringere,' Hein-
dorf ⁴ distringere! Having adopted the
latter form in the above , 1 do so
here, without feeling quite certain which is
right. The same variation occurs in the
MSS. in Caesar (B. G. i. 25). ¹ Ut pereat '
is an imitation of the Greek use of ὡς, ex-
proesing awish. me ‘at ille' the con-
struction is alittle ' , but the abrupt-
naes of the several clauses is well suited to
the occasion: ⁴ but for that man that pro-
vokoe me, he had better not touch me, 1
ery; he'll suffer if he dom) &c- It spoils
the sentence to put ⁴ melius—clamo ' ina
parenthesis, as Bentley does, so that ‘ illi’
may govern ‘ flebit!

164 HORATII FLACGI

CARMEN VIII.
A.U.C. 729 (Ξ)

This ode was composed on the anniversary of Horace’s accident with the tree (C. ii.
13), and is supposed by Franke (p. 158, sqq.) to have been written A.u.c. 729. His
argument is very long, and rests chiefly on the allusions in the fifth and sixth stanzas.
The Parthians were invaded that year by a Scythian army to restore Phraates (C. i. 26,
Introduction). In that year Augustus brought to an end his expedition against the
Cantabri (C. 4, Introduction), and during his absence he assumes that Maecenas was
governor of the city, as he had been on former occasions (Tac. Anu. vi. 11). He places
in that year the expedition of Lentulus against the tribes of the Danube (C. ii. 9. 23),
here represented by the Dacian king Cotison. The only authority on that subject is
Florus (iv. 12), who does not give any clue to the date. Τ11θ whole argument appears ω
be full of doubt. Lentulus’ was not the only expedition against the northam tribes. No
mention is any where made of Maecenas being employed as here supposed on the occasion
in question, nor does Horace say he was or even imply it: v. 17,·“ Mitte civiles super
'urbe curaS,’' might have been written to any public or thoughtful man in Reme on such
an occasion. Τὴε quarrels of the Parthians and the subjection of the Cantabri are the two
points that have most weight, and from those Ι should be inclined to adopt Franke's date
(rather than others that have been proposed), which fixes those of ii. 13; ii. 17, and fin·-
nishes an approximation to that of i. 20, as the introductions to those odes will show.

ARGUMENT.

Wonderest thou, learned friend, what this sacrifice means on the Kalends of March, and 1
a bachelor? On this day I was delivered from death, and it shall be a holiday. come,

anxiety. The Dacian has fallen, the Mede is divided against himself, the Cantabriam
is in chains and the Scythian has unstrung his bow. Be here the private gentleman3

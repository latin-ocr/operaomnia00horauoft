HORATII FLAGGI

Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper
Incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit, eo quod
Illecebris erat et grata novitate morandus
Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces

Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria ludo, ’

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,
Regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,
Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabes-nas,

Aut dum vitat humum nubes et inania captet.

Effutire leves indigna Tragoedia versus,

Ut festis matrona moveri jussa diebus,
Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda protervis.
Non ego inornata et dominantia nomina solum

Verbaque, Pisones, Satyrorum scriptor amabo;

choral songs or dithyrambs to which the
name τραγῳδία first belonged. Bentley
(Phal. p. 161) supposes the name to have
been derived from the prize, but denies that
it existed before the time of Thfflzpis. (See
below, v. 275, n.) The chorus appeared in
the character of Satyrs as attendants on
Dionysus, at whose festival they performed.
Their subjects were originally confined to
the adventuros, serious and sportive, of that
god, and therefore were a mixture of mirth
and gravity. Choerilus, an older contem·
porary of Aeschylus, seems to have laid
the foundation of an independent Satyric
Drama, the entire separation of which from
tragedy, as we now understand the word,
was effected a few years later by Pratinas of
Phlius in Argolis, about ac. 500: thence-
forward it was usual for the tragic poets to
exhibit four plays at a time (tetralogies), of
which the fourth was a Satyric Drama, such
as the Cyclops of Euripides. The following
remarks will explain most of this passage :—
“ The Satyric Drama was not a comedy,
but a playful tragedy. Its subjects were
taken from the same class of adventures of
Bacchus and the heroes as tragedy3 but
they were so treated in connexion with rude
objects of outward nature that the presence
and participation of rustic petulant Satyrs
seemed quite appropriate. Accordingly all
soenes from free untamed nature, adven-
tures of a striking character, where strange
monsters or savage tyrants of mythology
are overcome by valour or stratagem, belong
to this class3 and in such soenes as these
the Satyrs could express various feelings of

terror and deligha disgmt and dedre, with
all the openness and unreserve whichbelong
to their character. All mythical subice&
and characters were not therefore suited to
the Satyric Drama. The character best.
suited to it seems to have been the powers-11
hero Hercules, an eater and drinker and
boon companion, who, when he is in
humour, allows himself to be amused by
the petulant sporta of Satyra md oflaer

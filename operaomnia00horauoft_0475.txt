Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque

Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum:

'Si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, jus est

J udiciumque.” ‘⁶ Esto, si quis malm sed bona si quis
J udice condiderit laudatus caesare? si quis

Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse. ² ”

79. nihil hinc diffindere portuum] This
was tho reading of Comm. Cruq.; for he
explains it thus: ‘⁴ Infirmare, mutare, dif-
ferre, ufitur Trebatius juris antiqui verbo.
hactor enim solebat dicere ‘hic dies dif-
flammo! ” Porphyrion’s note in Ascen-
; legitur εὕδω diffi-

dcre,” which I take to mean ‘diffinderess

mnam! markover the ‘i’ being omitted.
Thac are molereadingsin thalassum
ndffiomhueth-nin almost any otherverse
otum-m. Tbeyvaryin thefirstplace
boewoenfflinc’md ⁴hic‚’ and for the verb
they have ‘diffundere' ‘diffidere,’ ‘defin-
gue,’ ⁴defindere,’ ⁴ diffindere? ‘diffinget-e,¹
⁴diffigere,' ‘defringere’ Fea says the ba-
lance of MSS. and editions is in favour of
diffingere? though he prefers ⁴ diffindere!

Bentleyarguesfor ‘diffingere'inthe sense
inwhichitis used inc.iii.29.47=“D1f·

finget infectumque reddet ;” and Heindorf
agrees with him. The oldest editions have
that word, and Lambinuswas the first to in-

troduce ⁴ diffindere! Itwill be seen that the
Scholiast says ‘diffindere’ is a legal ιιι-ειη

butas euchitis onlyused in the senseoi'
adjourning business to another day, and was
peculiar to the pnetor's functions3 that
saise too has no place here. (See ForcelL).
Fea, however, with whom Orelli agrees,
thinks Horace jocularly puts a legal term m
hebatius' mouth, because he was a lawyer,
but without meaning it should have more
thau its primary signification, which would
bc ‘to cut off,' and so 'lh-ebatius means
tbereisnopart ofwhat Horace hassaid
that he wished to cancel or separate from
thamnas thebad is separated from the
good. 1 prefer this word toany ofthe
others, but it is clear it has no technical
aenae here· and as tn the supposed J'oke, it
does not mike me very forcibly. noa-ing

reads‘ diffindere) but supposes it to have
the meaning of‘ secare ’above (S. ι. 10. 15,
and Epp. i. 16. 42); that is, to decide;
and Trebatius, therefore, according to him,
says he cannot decide the question froid
the premises Horace has put before him
(⁴hinc‘.) Cicero bas ‘dissolvere' in a
seusesomethinglikethis (de Oratii. §236):
“Orator odiam res saepe quas argumento
dilui nou facile estjooo risuque dissolvit-”

Ithink Doeriug's suggestionq isworthy of
consideration.

80. Sed tamen] If Doering’s interpreta-
flou of ‘diffindere' be correct, Trebatius
means ⁴ though 1 cannot pretend to decide
the case you put before me, 1 think it right
to warn you,' &c- If the other be Horace's
meaning, Trebatius says ⁴ though 1 have no
fault to find with your remarks, still,r &c.
By the XII Tables, the writing of scurrilous
verses m among the few offences that
were punishable with death. See Dict. Ant„
art. ‘Injuria,' and compare Epp. ii. l. 153}
There was a ‘lex Cornelia de injuriis,’
which probably included the offence of
wrin'ng scurrilous verses. But Augustus
himself (aster this Satire was written) ap-
pears to have proposed a law on the subject,
as we leam from Suetonius (Oetav. c. 55).

“Id modo censuit cognoscendum de iis qui

libellos aut carmina ad infamiam cujuspiam
suo vel alieno nomine edant.'’ When Tre-
batius says there is ‘jus judieiumquess he
meansthat there is lawand alsothereare
legal proceedings for this case. ‘Ne forte’
isusedasinC. iv. 9. 1, whereaeenote, and
compareEpp. i..l 13, 18. 58; ii. 1. 208.
With Heindorf 1 understand⁴ sanctarum’
to be ιι participle‚⁴ quae sanciuntur31-San
cirelegem' was to affix the penaltyto a

⁴‚lex’ and so give it effect.

what Bentley says in favour of ⁴ laxaverit?
which word he adopts. Imbinus had
some MS. authority for it, and Heindorf
adopts it. But ⁴ latraverit ' appearsin nearly

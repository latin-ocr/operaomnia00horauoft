HORATII FLAGGI

Aut positum ante mea quia pullum in parte catini
Sustulit esuriens, minus hoc jucundus amicus
Sit mihi? Quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si

Prodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarit?

95

Quis paria esse fere placuit peccata laborant ¹

Cum ventum ad verum est; sensus moresque repugnant
Atque ipsa utilitas, justi prope mater et aequi.

Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,

Mutum et turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter

100

Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
Pugnabant armis quae post fabricaverat usus,
Donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
Nominaque invenere ; dehinc absistere bello,

Oppida coeperunt munire et ponere leges,

10⁵

Ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis adulter.
Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus teterrima belli
Causa, sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,

Quos venerem incertam rapientes more ferarum

Viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus.

J ura inventa metu injusti fateare necesse est,
Tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.

95. commissa fide] This is a form both
of the genitive and dative. See C. iii. 7. 4:
⁴⁴ Constantis juvenem fide.”

96. Quis paria essesere] This common
doctrine of the Stoics is notit-ed by Cicero
(de Fin. iv. 19) 81111 condemned on the
principles of common sense and truth‚ as
here. ‘ Laborant,' ‘ they are in a dilemma.’
In making expediency the parent of justice,
or something like it (⁴ prope ’), Horace
follows 811 Epicurean notion. One of Epi-
curus's dogmas appears to have been that
justice was nothing by itself, but merely 8
social compact by which men bound them-
selves to abstain from injuring one another.
(Diog. Laert. x. 150.) Narrow and sub-
jective as this view of the case may be, it is
not worse than that which, under the sanc-
tion of 8 popular name, has been long
taught for moral philosophy at one of ⁴our
principal universities. The Stoics affirmed
that Justice had an objective existence, and
she was held to be the daughter of Zeus.

102. usum] Here this signifies ‘ need.' It
generally occurs (in this sense) in combina-
tion with ‘ est ‘ or ⁴ venit.⁷ ⁴ Verba nomina·
que ' conventionally embraces all the parts
of speech, like the Greek ὀνόματα καὶ
ῥήματα. ‘ Notae ’ are symbols, as in short-

hand writing for instance; 81111 11118 line
may perhaps be most aecurately rendemd,
¹ till they invented language whereby they
could give 8 symbolical form to 1118 80811118
of their voice and to their feelings!

111. Jura inventa metu injusti] lfthis
be admitted, as of course it must be. then
Injustice, 81111 if so Justioe, was anterior
to any laws or social compact, express or
implied3 so that the doctrine above laid
down falls to the ground; and *that justice
of which expediency is said to be the
mother turns out to be nothing more than
magistrates’ justice,—the justice of statutas.
which may be just or unjust. The· philo-'
sophy that would visit all offences, great
and small, with the same condign penalty,
is absurd; but he who affirma that lying is
lying, theft is there, lust is lust, in whatever
form or degree, or in whatever person it
appears, says no more than that fire is fire,
or water is water, whether we take a vol-
cano or a rushlight to represent the one,
811 ocean or a bucketful to represent 1118
other.

112. evolvere] This word, which signifies
‘to read,’ is taken from the unrolling of a
parchment ⁴ usque ad umbilicum.' See
Epod. xiv. 8, 11.

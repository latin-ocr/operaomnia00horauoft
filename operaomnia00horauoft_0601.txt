Di tihi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.
Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno,
Qui sapere et fari possit quae sentiat, et cui

Gratia, fama, valetudo contingat abunde,

Et mundus vietus non deficiente crumena?
Inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras,
Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum:
Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora.

Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises

obt-rius says truly is a piece of gram-

it means ‘⁴ you always were since 1 first
knew you,’ 'which is a new sense for the

before you went into the oountry;'’ that is,
“when 1 last saw γοιι,1 ’which implies a
doubt whether he wss so at the time of
wrin’ng. Others (Goener and Doering)
suppose it to mean ‘you were born so3
this would be like the Greek ἔφυς. Terence

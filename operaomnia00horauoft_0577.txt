Panna dicte mihi, summa dicende Camena,

Non eadem est aetas, non mens. Veianius armis ⁴

Ne populum extrema toties exoret arena.

4. Veianius mnis Herculis adpoetem]
Veianius was a ‘mdiu-ius: and when he
was di he hung up his weapons in
the temple of Hercules just as the man is
made to hang up the armsof lovein the
temple of Venus when they had ⁴eeased to
profit him, in C. iii. 26. 3:

Lares (see S. i. 5. 65, ιι., “ Donasaet jamne

boys dedicated their ‘ bulla ' when they as-
sumed the ‘toga virilis’ (⁴⁴Buuaque suc-
cinctis Ian-ibus donata pependit,” Pers. v.
31), and generally, aa 'Pul-nebus remarks,
those who gave up any trade or calling
dedicated the instmmenta with which they
hadfollowedit tothe godsandtothatgod
under whose patronage they
had placed themselves. Hercula would
naturallybechosenbyagladiawr, or bya
soldier as in an ep in the Anthologia
(Brunck, vol. i. p. 254). Similar actions
are frequently represented in those epi-
grams, as of a fisherman dedicating his netz
to the Nymphs (vol. ii. p. 494), a huntsman
his nets and quiver to Mer-cury (vol. i. p.
223),&c. So the shepherd hange up hia
flute on atree to Pan (Tibullus ii. 5. 29):

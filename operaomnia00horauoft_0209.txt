CARMINUM 111. 15.

ARGUMENT.

⁴ Put a stop to thy inti-iguem for thou art old and poor, a cloud among bright stars, ready

to drop into thy grave. What heeometh ¹¹¹5 dualiter beoometh not thee, Chloris.
She may go and besiege the young men 's doors. she is in love and cannot help it.

Uxon pauperis Ibyci,

Tandem nequitiae fige modum tuae

Famosisque laboribus:

Maturo propior desine funeri

Inter ludere virgines

Et stellis nebulam spargere candidis.
Non si quid Pholoen satis

Et te, Chlori, decet: filia rectius
Expugnat juvenum domos,

Pulso Thyias uti concita tympano.

Illam cogit amor Nothi

10

Lascivae similem ludere capreae:

Te lanae prope nobilem

Tonsae Luceriam, non citharae decent,

Nec flos purpureus rosae

15

Nec poti vetulam faece tenus cadi.

6. Et stellis nebulam] An old woman 111
a company of girls would be like a cloud in
a star-ry sky. On the elegy of Tibullus
mentioned before (C. i. 33. 7.) Heyne has
the following note, which Buttmann calls
incomprehensible (unbegreiflich): ¹‘ Pholoe
interclarasejus aetatis puellas etiam ex Ho-
ratio nota est ubi, C. i. 33- 7, ”pm puella

fastidit alium mollem puerum, et

loea is a virtuous girl who would scorn the
advanees os a profligate like Cyrus. The
mondisafimid girlas her· title ‘fugax'
shows. 8110 is also eoup led with a young
Chloris, as handsome aa herself. The Pho-

ζ’ 1οἔ of this ode is the wauton daughter os a

wauton old mother, Chloris by name. But
Heyneand others eonfound all these per·
sons. Such, as Buttmann has very well
shown, are the inconsistencioe of the matter-
of-fact school of interpretem. ’

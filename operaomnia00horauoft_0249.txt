Et quandoque potentior

219

Largi muneribus riserit aemuli

Albanos prope te lacus

Ponet marmoream sub trabe citrea.

Illic plurima naribus

20

Duces thura, lyraeque et Berecyntiae

“ · Delectabere tibiae

Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula;

Illic bis pueri die

25

Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum

Laudantes pede candido

In morem Salium ter quatient humum.

Me nec femina nee puer

J am nec spes animi credula mutui,

Nec certare juvat mero

30

Nec vincire novis tempora floribus.
Sed cur heu, Ligurine, cur
Manat rara meas lacruma per genas?

Gur facunda parum decoro

35

Inter verba cadit lingua silentio?

Nocturnis ego somniis

J am captum teneo, jam volucrem sequor

Te per gramina Martii

Campi, te p'er aquas, dure, volubiles.

Scholiasta mean when they say (v. 2, n.)

“ἀλληγορικῦς ad Venerem scdbitss' with
which expression Jani need not maerore
qum-rel. He mistakes its meaning. The
idea corresponds to “militavi non sine
gloria” (iii. 26. 2).

17. Et quandoque] ι. e. ‘whenever with
your aid his charms shall beat the rich
precenta of his rival, he shall set you up in
marhle ander a dhon roos by the shore of

· one of the Alban lakes,’ of which there were

two close together, the Albanus (Albano)
and Nemorensis (Nemi), and on one of
thoee it appears Fabius had a house. 'Hie
reading ‘Cypria' must have arisen from

‘yptrabeC ria' (i. 1. 13). Ithasno place
here, though Goener adopts it. ‘Largi is
abetterreading than‘ largis.' Horace does
not usually put the epithet next to its noun.

As to ⁴ Berecyntiae: compare C. iii. 19. 20.
‘ Lyrae ’ and ⁸ tibiae ' are in the dative case
aster ‘ mixtis! Bentley aster Cruquius adopts
the ablativo, which appears in some MSS„
and among others the oldest Blandinian.
28. ter quatient thamnam] See C. iii. 18.
16. On the first few days of March, during
the festival of Mars, the Salii, his priests,
went in prooession through the city singing
and dancing, from whence they are said to
have derived their name, “ Jam dederat
Saliis (a saltu nomina ducunt) '’ (Ovid, F. iii.
387). The practice, according to Livy, was
instituted by Numa (i. 20), ‘⁴ per urbem ire
canentes oermina cum tripudiis sollennique
saltatione jussi sunt.'’ See Epp. ii. 1. 86.
35. The last syllable in this line is cut
off. .

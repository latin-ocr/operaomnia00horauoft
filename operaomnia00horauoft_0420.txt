390 HORATII FLAGGI

8 slave, do you take upon yourself ιο put citizens to death ?’' ‘⁸ Well,'' says he, “ but
my colleague is a step lower than me.'’ ‘⁴ Suppose 110 is; does that make you a Paullus
or 8 Messalla? He at any rate has stout lungs, and that’s what we like.”

A word now about myself, the freedman’s son, with which they are all taunfing me now
because I am a friend of yours, Maecenas, as once they did because 1 had a tribuue’s
command. This they might perhaps envy me with some reason; but not the other,
for you are ever careful iu your choice of friends, and 118ιο low flattery. It was not
luck that brought me to your notice ε Virgil introduced me first, and then Varius. I
came modestly into your presence. Ι made no boast of birth or wealth, but told you
who and what I was. You answered as usual briefly, dismissed me, and in nine
months sent for me again, and admitted me to your circle. Herein 1 am happy, that
my merit, not my birth, commended me ιο 0110 110 discerning. But if my faults are
not great, and if my friends are attached ιο 1110, Ῑ 118νο ιο thank my father for thagwho
would not send me ιο 8 country school but brought me up ιο Rome ιο 110 eduoeted.
He spared no expense: he took mc ιο school every day himself 3 in short, he preserved
mc from vice and even the imputation of it. He would not have 110011 ashamed if
after all Ι 11811 110011 obliged to resort to his old trade for a livelihood, and 1 should
not have complained a bit. To him be all the praise and 811 my gmfimde. Never let
me be ashamed of such a father as that, or say, as so many do, it was not my fault that
my father was not a ireeman. My lang-uage and views are very different from thing
for let who will reverse their lives and choose new parents to suit their pride, 1 am
content with mine 3 and though othersssmay think me mad to say so, you will judgo 1110
wise, I know, for declining a load I am not used to bear. Ι should have 111 81118138 my

means3 to bow to a host of people3 to pay attendants ιο walk with me3 to get 111018 ·

slaves and horses3 to hire carriages. As it is I may ride to Tarentum, if I like, on 8
common mule, with my portmanteau behind, and no one calls me shabby as they do
you, Tillius, most noble senator and praetor, when you go travelling with your five
slaves and utensil behind you. I can go where Ι like by myself, about the market,
and circus, and forum in the evening, and then go home ιο my simple 111081 81111 poorly
furnished dining room, and then ω bed, to sleep undisturbed. Ι lie till 18ιο wrin'ng
81111 reading, and then take a stroll, or go and play till 1 am tired, then tabatha, and
then to lunch lightly and lounge at home. Could Ι live more happily thau thia if my
father and his father and all my relations had been quaestors ? ¹

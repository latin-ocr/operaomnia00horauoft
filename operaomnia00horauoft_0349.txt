42. Infantis Helenae] The story of
Stesichorus losinghis sight as ι punishment
for a libel on Helen, and recovering it aster
wrifing anapology and recantation, has
beenreferredtobefore (c.i.16‚1nt1·0du0-
tion). Other writers atu-ibute the restora-
tion to Helen herself, Horace to her bro-
thers. 'Hie story is mentioned, besides
Plato mffiuoted in the above place), by Iso-
oeates.(Helen Encom. e. 29), Chrysosto ιιι

writers refer to Stesichorum mesntation or

he ιιο doubt Horace was well scquainted
with the whole poem. Why he should
have given a different version of the story
fionthatosotherswho mustalsohsve

have contained a prayer to the Dioscuri.
uach has been written οιι the subject by
modern scholare, some of whom are men-

blindiug and the restorationtothe brothers,
but he ugevidently only follows Horace, while

‘vicum' nearly all the MSS. appear to have
‘vicem' Dacierpret'ers‘ vicem, ’which hesays

Of what follows Porphyrion says, “ urban·

namque accipienda haec ε quis enim sic
laudet qui simpliciter agit? ⁴ o quae uon es
sordidi generis ! nec ooea humana ad male-
ficia colligis !' et reliqua.” This sufficiently
explains the spirit of the passage (see Argu-
meut), and what is meant by ‘novendiales
dissipare pulveres! It appears, if we sreto
believe the old commentatore, to have been
the practice to bury the ashes nine days
aster death. Servius (ou Aen. v. 64) says
the body was kept st home seven days, ou
the eig hth it was burnt, and on the ninth
bui-iedg, and then he quotes this

little variation as to the time of burning,

οιι the‘ Interment of the Dead ’.) Heyne,
on the above pmsage of virgil (which
refers to the games instituted in memory
of Anchises), aud on v. 762 of the nme
book, may be consulted. Saered cere-
monias appear to have been observed (but
we cannot suppose this was genu-al) for
nine days in honour of the dead (see. be-
sidoeVirgil, Le„ StatTheb. vi. Μαι
But this has nothing to do with Hoeq
meaning. Hemeanstosay that the witeh
dug up the ashes of the dead imm
(uot nine days, as Forcellini says) aster
their burial, while they were fresh and

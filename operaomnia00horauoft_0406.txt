376 HORATII FLAGOI

seventeen days after Horace had lefl: Rome. The route they took was not the sbortest
or the easiest, which lay through Venusia and Tarentum. They preferred taking the
north-eastern road which strikes across the country from Beneventum, and, reaching the
coast at Barium, continues along the shore till it comes to Brundusium. Tbey were
evidently not pressed for time, and probably took the road they did because it passed
through Canusium, whither one of the party was bound. Maecenas made his journey as
agreeable as under the circumstances it could be, by taking withhim such companions;
and they all appear to great advantage in Horace’s good-humoured diary. There was no
restraint between the patron and his friends, and their affection for him and one another
it is very pleasant to contemplate.

Since if the occasion above supposed be that on which the mission was sent, they could
1101 have met Antonius at Brundusium, their journey could not have ended there:
Maecenas at least, and 1118 official companions, must have gone on to Tarentum. Whether
Horace accompanied them is uncertain. Ι think probably he did not; but that Maecenas,
hearing that Antonius had come to Brundusium, and passed on to Tarentum, made all
haste to resch that place. I think it likely, however, that Horace took the oppor-
tunity of his return to Rome to visit 1118 native town and its neighbourhood. Kirchner
(Qu. Hor. p. 39, sq.) thinks that it was on this occasion he wrote the ode to Archytas
(i. 28), and that to the fountain of Bandusia (iii. 13); that he visited Septimius (C. ii. 6),
and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella (S. ii. 2). Probably Horace took more than
one journey to Tarentum, with which when he wrote his ode to Septimius he appears to
have had very pleasant associations. He seems to have had in mind, as the Scholiasta
say, the description by Lucilius of a journey he took to Capua, of which three· οι· four
verses only have been preserved (see note on v. 6).

They left Rome by the Porta Capena, be-

in the southern quarter of the city. The

reading ‘ excepit’ is correct, and 1188 1110
support of the 11081 MSS. ‘ Accepit,’
‘ cepit,' are various readings, of which,
after Lambinus and Cruquius, Bentley has
adopted the first. Aricia (La Riccia), one
of the most ancient towns of Latium, was
sixteen miles from Rome. It was situated
on the side of a hill sloping down to a valley
called Vallis Aricina, through which the
Appia Via passed. This part of the road is
still in good preservation. The citadel was
placed on the top of the hin (Strabo, v.
p. 239), and on that spot stands the modern
town. Aricia was a considerable town in
Horace's time, and for some centuries aster.
Cicero calls it “municipium—vetustate
antiquissimum, splendore municipum ho-
nestiss imum’ ” (Phil. iii. 6). 118 neighbour-

hood to Rome, and accessible position, con·

by its association with the worship of Diana

wealthy Romans had villas in the neigh-
bourhood.

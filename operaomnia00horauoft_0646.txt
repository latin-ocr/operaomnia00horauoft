Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum;
Oui placet alterius sua nimirum est odio sors.

Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique ε
In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.
Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea villicus optas;

Me constare mihi scis, et discedere tristem
Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.
Non eadem miramur ; eo disconvenit inter
Meque et te : nam quae deserta et inhospita tesca

Credis amoena vocat mecum qui sentit, et odit
Fornix tibi et uncta popina

Quae tu pulchra putas,

chariots remained till the race was ready to
begin. They were then brought out and
ranged side by side behind a rope called
‘alba linea' or ‘calx,’ which was stretched
across the course and formed a barrier,
beyond which the chariots could not ad-
vance till the signal was given and the rope
withdrawn. It is from this obstrue-tion or
from the ‘carceres ' that the metaphor in
the text is taken.

13. se non effuqit unquam] Compare
C. ii. 16. 19:

“ — patriae quis exul
Se quoque fugit? ''

14. Tu mediastinus] See Becker’s Gall.
Exe. on the ‘ Slave Family! He had been
one of the lowest slaves, used for all manner
of work in the ‘ familia urbana,’ and by his
pitiful countenance (for he was afi-aid per-
haps to speak) had shown how much he
wished to be delivered from that condition
and to be sent to work on the farm, though
that was generally considered to be the
greatest punishment (see S. ii. 7. 118, n.).
When there he had risen it may be sup-
posed to be ⁴ villicus,’ for it is not likely a
‘ mediastinus ’ from the town would be sud-
denly promoted to be steward of the farm.
That was the name for the lowest sort of
slave both in the town and country esta-
blishment. It is derived, Foreellini says,
from ‘medius,’ from his standing in the
midst and being at every one's call. The
Scholiasts derive the word from ἄστυ, be—
cause he lived in the middle of the city,
which is nonsense. Porphyrion, on this
passage, explains ‘ mediastinus' to be a
⁴ balneator‚¹ one who attended to the baths;

and Priscian, quoted by Foreellini and Bec-
ker (ubi sup.), limits the name to the bath-
ing slaves. He is corrected by Nonius (ii.
573, ap. Forcell.); but it is probable that
the ‘ balneatores ' were included in the class
of slaves called ‘ mediastini!

19. tesca] Acron says ‘tesca' (or ‘ tes-
qua,' as it is in Ascensius’ edition of his
text and Porphyrion’s, and so it appears in
Comm. Cruq.) are “loca deserta et diffi-
cilia,’' and that it is a Sabine word. Ac-
cording to the authorities quoted by Festus
it signified also a consecrated enclosure, and
Varro says much the same (de Ling. Lat. 6.
2). He derives the word from ⁸ tueor,' be-
cause therein the mysteries of the gods were
observed (‘ tuentur ’). There are others,
according to Foreell., who believe the word
to be derived from the Greek δασὺσκιυς
(δασύς and σκιά). There is little proba-
bility in either of these etymologies. Ae-
cius used the word before Horace, aud
Lucan after him (vi, 41) : ‘¹ Amplexus fines,
saltus, nemorosaque tesca, Et silvas.'’

21. Forniae tibi et uncta popina] within

the porticus, which ran round the chous, . s

were vaulted chambers (‘ fornices '), which
were let out to prostitute33 and iu other
parts of the city, under different buildings,
public and private, there were similar mults
employed in the same way. As to ⁸ popina'
(which he calls ‘ uncta,’ because of the greasv
viands oooked there), see S. ii. 4. 62, n.

23. Anyulus iste feret] Horace writes
as if he were repeating the eontemptuous
language of the villicus. ‘ That little nook
of yours would produce pepper and frankin-
oense (which of course was impossible)
sooner than grapes.' The grapes grown on

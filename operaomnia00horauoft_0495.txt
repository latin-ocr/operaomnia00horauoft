valunblepropertyz among the rest, vessels
of Corinthiun bronze (osten, but improperiy,
called bruas), of such antiquity that the
founder of Corinth might be supposed
to have used them for washing his feet.
This satire upon the rage for antiquated
pieees of sumitate would have applied still
more to the habits of the Romans at a
later lime. It appears to have gone to
absurd lengths during the Empire. Mar-
tini (ix. 58) speaks of the worn 'handloe

22. infabre] ⁴ Ῑιι an unworkmanlike man-
ner! The reverse of this is ‘affabre,' used
by ciem (in Verr. Act. i. c. 5): ‘⁸ Deum
denique nullum Siculis qui ei paulo magis
affabre atque antiquo artificio factus vide-
retur reliquit.” The art of founding is of
great antiquity, though the earliest metai
statues were beaten out of lump s with the
hammer. It was a procaes of much nicety,
and the fitting of the partsreq uired great
skill. The subjecta of casting and the metal
called‘ aes,' arediscuasedinthe Dict. Ant„
arta. ‘'Bronze aad· Aes,'

24. unm] See A. P. 323 S. ii. 6. 57.

25. Mercuriale] There appears tohave
been a mercantile association called Mer-
curiales at Rome. Cicero mila it a ⁸ eol·
legium ’ (ad Qu. Frat- ii. 5): ‘⁴ M. Furium
Flaccum equestrem Romnum, bominem
nequam, Capitolini et Mercuriales de col-
legio ejecerunt.'’ But Damasippus merely
means that his skill in making ban-gains was
so well known that he was called all over the
town a ward of Mercury, and we need not
suppose him to have been a mercator.
(See Introduction.) Au the MSS. and
Acron have ‘ Mercuriale! Sanadon and
some others have the dative, which is the
more usual construction. See below, v.
47, ιι. and Key's L. G. 984, note. See
also Gellius xv. 29: “Duae istae in lo-
quendo figurae notae satis usitataeque sunt

‘Mihi nomen eet Julius’ et· mihi nomen
ext Julio! ‘Compita’ were those spots
where two or more streete converged to a
point or mossed one another. At these
places idlers lounged, and passengers
smpped, is they were so disposed, to offer
a prayer to the Lares publici or Com-
pitalae, whose altars were erected there
(See below, v. 281, n.)

27. morbi purqatum] This genitive
follows the Greek construction. ⁴ Purgare'
comes under the oetegory of verbs of re-
moval and separation referred to in Key's
L. G. 94⁰, where he quotes this example
and C. ii. 9. i7, “ desine mollium Tandem
querelarum,'' where see note. Horace calls
the man’s mania for bargains a disease, and
he is surprised how he ever got over it.
⁸ But‚’ says he, ‘you have only excb
that dison-der for another (that of giving ad-
vice where it is not wanted), as the patient
in a lethargy has been known suddenly to
jump up and assault the doctor. Provided
however you don't follow his example, be
it as you please.' On ‘ trajecto ² Porphyrion
remarks, “ Proprie ⁴ trajecto ς’ ita enim me-
dici dicunt.” ‘ Miser’ is also said to be a
medical word for ‘ diseased.' ⁸ Hic ' means

‘any one,’ ‘such au one.'

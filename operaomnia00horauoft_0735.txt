“originally denoted nothing but the joet
and hauteu-used at the festivals of Demeterss’
of whose worship Paros, the birth· place of
Archilochus, was next to Eleusis the prin·
cipal seat. From thaee festivals therefore,
the soenes of unroetrained raillery and scur-
rilous jesfing, Archilochus maybe supposed
to have coneeived his iambioe. The iambic
trimeter is said to have been invented by him
(Plutarch de Musio, c. 28), and likewise the
trodmic tetrameter, and other mensum par
ticularly described by Mfiller. Of the two

Ὗ firsthe says: “Thoeemetm werein their

way as elaborate productioris of Greek taste
and genius as the Parthenon or the statue

. of the Olympio Jupiter. Nor can there be
“ any stronger proot' of their perfectiori than

that metros said to have been invented by
Archilochus retained their currencythroug h
an ages of Greek poetry; and that although

'their applicafion varied in many ways, no

improvement was made in their
structum” (p. 136). The principal Iambic
writers who followed Archilochus were
Simonides of Amorgns, a younger contem-
por-ary of Solon, and Hipponax of Ephesus
iac 540).

in the dialogus of the earliest Greek trage-
dieswas the tmchaic temeter, which metre
isused in manypassages of thePersae ot'
Aeschylus. But the iambis trimeter appears
to have been used by ffirynichus. Aristotle
(Ροὸι. iv. 19) calls it μάλιστα λεκτικὸν τῶν
μέτρων, and comparing it with the Epic ho
says (Rhet- iii. 8. 4). νῦν δὲ ῥυθμρῦν ὁ

in the following passage (Poet. 24. 10); τὸ ’
ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικά, τὸ

κόν means that the men-e suits the langnage
of action. By ‘alternis sermonibus' Horace
means dialogue generally, not those dia-

loguoe in which verse answers to verse,
στιχομυθὶα. When he says that the iam-
bic overcomoe the noise of the theatre, it
may be that he refers to the clear intona-
tion which that metre admits of, or to iix
engaging the popular attention from its

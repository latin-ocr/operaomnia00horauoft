HORATII FLAGOI

Interpellandi locus hic erat : “ Est tibi mater,

Cognati, quis te salvo est opus 3''—“ Haud mihi quisquam.
Omnes composui.”—F elices ! nunc ego resto,

Confice ; namque instat fatum mihi triste Sabella

Quod puero cecinit divina mota anus urna :

29. C'onfice .- namque instat] ‘ Confice,'
despatch me, fiuish me. ’ It is a technical

word for the transacn'on and completion of

business. As to the Sabine witches, see
Epod. xvii. 28; and on ‘ urna,' see C. ii. 3.
25, n. As Fate, so the witch shakes her
urn, and the lot or name of this or that
person falls out, on which she pronounces
her prophecies. The Scholiasts Acron and
Comm. Cruq. take ⁴ mota' as the nominative
case, in the sense of ‘commota,’ agitated.
I believe all the three words—‘divina,'
‘ mota,' ‘ urna '—to be in the ablative,
though Bentley says that this >reading is
“ita scabrum atque horridum ut ne pro-
letario quidem vati, nedum Horatio dignum
sit.'’ He himself agrees with Cruquius,
and transposing ‘ divina ’ and ‘ mota,' makes
the former agree with ‘ anus.' I am satis-
fied with the reading of all the MSS.
¹ Quandocunque ' has sometimes, but rarely,
the sense of ‘aliquando‚' ‘ sometime or
other! Bentley quotes two instances from
Ovid, which will be found in Forcellini.

35. Ventum erat ad Vestam] They had
now had an hour's walk, and having passed
through the Forum were approaching the
Tiber, not far from which, and to the west of
Mons Palatinus, stood the temple of Vesta,
with the Atrium Numae and Lucus Vestae
attached (C. i. 2. 16, n.). It is generally
stated that the temple of Vesta was close
to the ‘ puteal Libonis ’ (see S. ii. 6. 35, n.)‚
where the praetor held his court. But that
appears to have been 111 the Forum, which
this temple was not. Nardini places in its
immediate neighbourhood the Basilica J ulia,
where the centumviri held their courts, in
which also the praetor presided. Martial
thus alludes to them (vi. 38. 4) :—

“Jam clamor centumque viri densumque
vuciglcgngffinfanfi Julia tecta 1111100111.η ⁷.

If this be so, we may suppose that it was
here the man had to make his appearance,
or forfeit his ‘ vadimonium? It was now
past the hour when the business of the v
courts commenoed, as Martial says iv. 8.
2), “ Exercet raucos tertia musidioos!

36. casu tunc respondere vadato] This
passage has been fully explained by Mr.
Long in his note on Cic. Ver-r. ii. 3. 15 2—
“The expression ‘ vadari aliquem ’ 11108113
to require ‘vadesf ‘surefies,' of a party.
The corresponding term is ⁴ vadimonium
promittere,’ which is said of him'who gives
⁴ vades! Bentley’s correction of ‘ vadatus'
for ‘vadato ’ is against all the MSS. and
the general usage of the word, though ⁸ va·
datus' is sometimes used passively, as he
shows.'' The same may be said of the par-
ticiples of other deponent verbs (see C. i2²l.
24, n.), of which the passive sense however
must be clearly made out before it can be
admitted. The ‘ vadatus ’ therefore was
the plaintiff in an action, in which the hero
of this satire was defendant. He had entwed
into an engagement (⁴ vadimonium ⁷) to ap·
pear on acertain dayto answer to the ac-
tion, and if he failed he would lose his cause,
forfeit the amount of his ‘ vadimonium· and
be liable to be arrested in satisfaction of the

remainder of the debt, if that were not ⁵

covered by the ‘ poena desertionis' deposited

when the ‘ vadimonium ’ was entered into. ⁷

The amount of this was sometimes equal to

the sum in dispute, sometimes only one- Ἰ

half. Orelli interprets ‘litem’ of the ‘ poena
desertionis) But the word is nowhere else >

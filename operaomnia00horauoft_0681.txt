EPISTULARUM Ι. 20.

651

odisti claves et grata sigilla pudico;
- Paucis ostendi gemis et communia laudas,
Non ita nutritus. Fuge quo descendere gestis. 5

Non erit emisso reditus tibi.

‘⁴ Quid miser egi 3

Quid volui 3'' dices ubi quis te laeserit; et scis
In breve te cogi cum plenus languet amator.
Quodsi non odio peccantis desipit augur,

carus eris Romae donec te deserat aetas;

10

contrectatus ubi manibus sordescere vulgi
Goeperis, aut tineas pasces taciturnus inertes,
Aut fugies Uticam aut vinctus mitteris Ilerdam.
Ridebit monitor non exauditus, ut ille

Qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum

15

Iratus : quis enim invitum servare laboret?

Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem
Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.

Cum tibi sol tepidus plures admoverit aures,

3. odisti elaver] The ‘capsae' or ‘sm-inia’
(S.i. 4. 21, n.) were locked, or scaled, or
both; and women and young persons were
locked or seuled up in their chambers that
they might not get into mischief, which
restraint Horace says they liked if they
were chaste. He professes to reproach his
book for being tired of staying at home, and
being shown only to his friends, and want-
ing ω go out to be exposed like a prostitute
for sale, to which purpose he had not trained
it. There ean be no doubt that what is
here distinctly said of the Epistlae is true
of the other works of Horace, that they
were shown to his friends, and circulated
privately before they were collected and

published.

7. ubi quis te laeserit· ;] Τ118 MSS. vary
between ⁸ quis ’‘and quid.’ Bentley pre-
fers the latter. Comm. Cruq. writesst ‘post-
quam te aliquis reprehenderit.'' He there-

’ fore probably had ‘quis,' which I prefer.

⁸ In breve te cogi: as applied to the book,
means that it will be rolled up and put into
a case, and not taken out again. Τ118 meta-
phorical lang-uage is kept up in the follow-
ing words, in ⁸ peccantis‚' and in the notion
of its being thrown aside when the fresh-
ness of youth shall have left it.

9. Quodsi non odio peccantis] ‘ But if
the prophet is not blinded by his aversion
to the offender,’ that is, if I am not led by
my aversion to your wantonnaes to pro-
phesy too harshly of your fate. ⁴ Aetas ' is
used for any time of life according to the

oontext3 but more frequently for old age
than youth.

¹3. Aut fuqiea Uticam] You will be'
shipped off to Utica (in Libya), or to Ilerda
(Lerida) in Spain, or any where else in the
remote provinces, tied up as a bundle of
goods (¹vinctus’), and 1 shall laugh, for
what is the use of trying to save such 8
wilful thing? as the driver said when his ass
would go too near the edge of the precipioe‚
and he drove him over in a passion. It is
not known where this fable comes fmm.
Compare A. P. (467),“ Invitum qui servat,
idem facit occidenti.’'

18. balba senecta]- This keeps up the
image in v. 10. Horace says his book will
be reduced in its old age to the poor people’s
schools in thebaei: streets (see S. i. lo. 75,
n.). His writings came very soon to take
their place with Homer and Virgil iu 811 the
schools. See Juvenal (vii. 226) :—

‘⁴ Quot stabant pueri, cum totus decolor
mm, et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.”

19. Cum tibi sol tepidus] In the heat
of the day, aud before dinuer in the baths,
people read to themselves or one another.
See Martial (iv. 8. 7), “Hora libellorum
decima est, Eupheme, meorum.'’ It is not
easy to see the connexion of this line with
what goes before. It is something of a
contradiction. With ‘Me libertino natum
patre,' compare S. i. 6. 6, 46, 47.

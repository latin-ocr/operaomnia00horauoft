HORATII FLAOOI

Lassus ab indomito, vel si Romana fatigat lo
Militia assuetum graecari, seu pila velox

Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,

Seu te discus agit, pete cedentem aera disco;

Cum labor extuderit fastidia, siccus, inanis ¹

Sperne cibum vilem; nisi Hymettia mella Falerno 15

Ne biberis diluta.

Foris est promus et atrum
Defendens pisces hiemat mare:

Latrantem stomachum bene leniet.

cum sale panis
Unde putas aut

Qui partum? Non in caro nidore voluptas

Summa sed in te ipso est.

thau the ‘pila’ or ‘discusf which were were united m one, ‘condusproxnus,' as in

manly amusements enough. But Horace
assumes (v. 12) that the man' s ball play 13
rather lazy. Bentley, doubting whether
‘extuderit' can bear the meaning here re
quired, reads without authority 4 expulerit.'
The Scholiasts and all the MSS. have 4 ex-
tuderit! 4 Extuudo ' is no where else used
in this sense, but it is a very apt word for
the occasion. Hunger beating fastidious-
ness out of a man represents the power of
the one, and the contemptible character of
the other, very well.

15. πίει· Hymettia mella Falerno] This
constituted the drink called 4 mulsum,' οιίὀ-
μέλι, which was commonly 111-111111 31 1110
preparatory course called ⁴ gustus ' or ⁴ pro-
mulsis ⁷ (see S. i. 3. 6, n.), the former name
being taken from the dishes that were eaten
as a whet to the appetite, and the latter
from the mulsum that was taken with them.
(Gall. Sc. 9: The Banquet.) The use of
the strong Falernian wine for this mixture,
in which the usual proportion was four of
wine to one of honey, is condemned below,
S. 4. 25. Of the honeys used by the Ro-
mans of his day, but not mentioned by
Horace (see C. ii. 6. 18, 11.) 1110 best was
that of Hybla 111 810117; 1110 worst was that
of Corsica, mentioned in various epigrama of
Martial; ‘mulsum ' made with which was
held to be drink fit only for the vulgar.

16. promus] This was one of 1110401111-
113111ὀ1 upper domestic slaves, whose duty
it was to take charge of 1110 wine—cellar and
1311101.Ηο was 1101100 0311011 4 0011311113,’
3130 4 procurator peni,' ‘ steward of the pro-
visions. ’ Another name he bore was‘ oon·
‹,'lus because he had to take into 31010
(4 condere ') the provisions that were lefl: or
brought in for consumptiou3 and, as the
same person who locked up 3130 t'ook out
the provisions (4 promere Ῥ), both names

He therefore had authority over other slaves.
The ‘ atriensis ' was one who 11311 charge of
the 4 atrium,' and was also one of the prin·
cipal slaves.

17. hiemat mare .·] This word is only
known to have 'been used before Horace by
Sallust, who was fond of unusual and 31011310
words. Seneca (Epp.114) mentions that
he says (somewhere not known to us),

‘aq uis hiemantibus? and that Arruntius,
theq author of 3 history of one of the Punic
wars, and 311 imitator of Sallust, was always
dragging in this word ‘hiemare’ Pliny
uses it occasionally. Horaee' s 13310 was
insensibly affected by his study of tho
Greek poets, and he copied their χεῖμᾶζεται,
though he may also have seen and approved
more 111311 Senem does Sallust's 44 aquis
hiemantibus. '' With ‘ latrantem stoma·
chum,' compare ‘iratum ventrem ' (S. ii. 8.
5). A hungry man is vulgar-ly 33111 to have
a wolf in his belly 10 11113 day.

19. Qui partum ἵ] The subject is only
to be gathered from the context. ·‘ whence
do you suppose this appetite springs, or
how is it got ?'

20. pulmentaria quaere] The Scholiasts
tell us a story of 80013103, that, when he
was taking a long 113111, he ωοοωιωά for
his activity by saying ὄψον συνάγω, ‘I am
getting 331100 for 1117 1111111013

21. ostrea Nee scarus] Tbese were 311
3011011 up with 11104 gustus’ 10 stir up 1110
appetite. 0731013 were 031011 raw or dressed.
The‘ searus’ was a fish not known m these
days. It was rare even among the Romam,
and imported from 1110 Aegean sea. (Pliny

Sanos dicatur. Quanto hoc furiosius atque
Majus peccatum eet: paulum deliquit amicus,

Quod nisi concedas habeare msuavis, acerbus:

the composition of this Satire, says that· m
that year died Capito Ateius und Labeo
Antistius, two rival lights of their nge. If,
then, he is the ιι Horace means, it
could not have been for his boldness of

speech towards Augustus that he calls him

, mad, for he could αε the outside have been

but a youth when this δαείη was written.
Either, therefore, some other Labeo is in-
tendethorsomeothermndfreukofu. An-
fisfiusLabeo. From thewuythe name is
introduced, one might suppose it wne pro-
verbial. 1 mnnot think with Weichert
(Imt. Ven. p. 33, sqq.), Orelli, Estre, and
others, unt Marcus is probably called mad
beoeuse he beet his servunt violently on
some occasion for α small offenoe. What
Horace says is, thnt if e man were to do so,
hewould be called byall sane men more
inune than Labeo, who must therefore
heve ind the reputetion of being mad, per-
hpe from his recklessncss or something of
thatsort. Whntsensewouldtherebein

for a trifling offence he would be held more
med than hbeo, who did the same thing
I do not think the younger Labeo is meant

name is intended, wherein 1 with
Fea. Spohn (Jehu's Horace, edit. 2, p. 253)
suggest· C. Atinius hbeo, who was tribune
of the plebs about A.u.c. 635. (Liv. Epit.
59.) But it is impossible, 1 think, to my
who is meent. Bentley has a long note to
show that it is not probable M. Atinius
labeo should be the man, and suggests
⁴ Isabieno' for ‘labeone' referring to one
of that name who for his virulence was
mlled Rabienus by his contemporaries. He
is mentioned by Seneca in the preface to
the fifth book of his‘ Controversise!

84. pulum deliquit amictu ,]‘ Say your
friend has committed a fault so small that

if yondonotexcuse it youmustbelooked

npon as hnrsh3 yon hate himin your bitter-
ness, and run away from him! Concedo'
is uwd in this way by other writers (see
Foroeu..) Bentley would prefer‘ quoi 'for

‘qno‹i,¹ referring to the next δαείη, v. 14⁰,

‘cui si concedere nolis-¹ But he doe· not
say why Honoe should adopt the old form
here and the later there.

86. Βιιωκεηι] The editions end MSS.

Porphyrion, according to the text of As-
censins, cells the person “Octavius Drusus,
α usnrer md writer of historice, to which
he obliged his debtors to listen, which
was the worst punishment they could
sufferl’ Other variations ure ‘Risoss

‘,'Rufo ‘Risso’ (Asoensq) Ruffoss ‘.'Truso
Cruq nius first approved of ⁸,Ruso ' but
Bentley claime the merit of restoring that
name. Philostratus (vit. Polemonis) men-
tions one Varus, who followed the same
calling es Ruso, end mede a stipulation
with his debtors that they should, besides
pnying interest, listeu to his recitatione of
his own writings. Acron interprete ‘his-
torias' by ‘contumelias’ in one pbce, but
contradicts himself within α few hnae,
calling Ruso “historiarum melum scrip-
torem.” The text of these Scholimts is
very corrupt. ‘ Historins' 1 suppose to
menn talen or narratives of some sort.

The' Scholiasta, spoillng the joke, have re-
ferred to α celebrated engraver and
(see Smith's Dict. Biog. ‘ Auianius Evander)
ss the Evander of this place, who is clearly
the old king and ally of Aeneas. Porphyrion
professes to quote from certain writers who
had written on the subject of Horaee’s
characters ; so that there must heve been α
good deal of attention puid to that subject at
a very early period. Compare S. ii. 3. 21, ιι.

CARMEN XVII.

A.U.c. 728 (ἓ).

The two last lines of this ode, showing that Horace had not yet paid the snm-ifioe he
had vowed to Faunus for his preservation from death, makes it most probable that it was
written not long after C. 13 of this book, the composition of which has been assigned with
some hesitation to A.U.c. 728. In the same year Maecenas appears to have recovered
from a bad attack of sever to which he was liable, and was received with applause in the

theatre on his first appearance aster his illness (C. i. 20. 3). But his recovery seems

to have been only partial; and it would appear that Horace had to listen to hiscompln'nts
and apprehensions of death, his sear of which is said to have been great.

ARGUMENT.

Why kill me with thy complaints? I cannot survive thee, Maecenas: one half of my life
being gone, how should the other stay behind? 1 have sworn to die with thee, and tho
monsters of Hell shall not separate us. Our star is one and the same. ΤΙιε power of
Jove rescued thee from the adverse influence of Satura on that day when thou vert
received with acclamations in the theatre, and Faunus at the same time rescued me
from death. Offer thy sacrifice and dedicate thy temple, and 1 will offer my unpro-
tending lamb.

Con me querelis exanimas tuis? ‘s
Nee dis amicum est nec mihi te prius ‘
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.
Ah te meae si partem animae rapit 5
Maturior vis, quid moror altera,
Nec carus aeque nec superstes
Integer? Ille dies utramque

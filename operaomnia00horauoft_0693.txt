him a “vater ille Siculus Epicharmus”
(ad Διῒ. i. 19);ι ‘astutus nec insulsus

c. 5) says that Epicharmus and Phormis
were the first inventore of comedy. Bentley
(Epp. of Phalaris, p. 199) takes the fact to
be tint the comedies of Epicharmus were
the first fluat were written.

giving an account of Caecilius), and when he
recovered his freedom he retained thisname
as a ccgnomen. “Sed pom versum est
quasi in cognomentum ap ue Cae-
cilius Statius.” He died amc. 586, the
year aaa Ennius. His contemporaries
held hin in high estimation. According to
uno text ot* Suetonins’ life of Terence as it
now stands, Caecilius was the person to
who- Terence was directed by the Aediloe
to (arry his Andria for his judgment. He
found him at dinner, and because he was
:habbily ‹li-est, he was directed to sit down
on a stool and read what he had got. Aster
he had read a fewverses Caeciliuswasso
struck with what he had heard, that he
made the author come to table among the
gnests and finish his play. This aneedote
shows Caecilius' position. Cicero places
him, not without some hesitation, at the
head of the comic poets (sup. v. 56, n.).
Also in the canon, as it is called, of Volcatius

Terence in the sixth place, there is no de·
placed on his judgment.
Varro mys he was best in his plots, and
that he moved the feelings. Cicero, though
lie puts him so high, speaks ill of his latin

the judgment of a modern critic (sspence,

Polymetis, p. ll, sq.) upon Terence, which
1 should think represents the opinion of his
sensible contemporaries. It appears to me
veryjustasfarasit :“—Wemaysee
by that (the Eunuchus) and the rest of his
plays which remain to ns to what a degree
of mctness and elegance the Roman comedy
was arrived m his time. There· is a beauti-
ful simplicity which teigne through all his
works. There' is no searching aster wit, and
no ostentation of ornament in him. All his
speakers seem to say just what they should
say and no more. The story' is always going
on, and on just as it ought. This
wliole age, long before Terence and long
afters is rather remarkable for strength thau
beauty in writing. The Roman langnage
itself in his hands seems to be improved be·
yond what one could ever expect, and to be
advnnced almost a hundred years sorwarder
than the times he lived in.” This he ac·
counts for by his intercourse with Laelius
and Scipio, by both of whom Terence was
su to have been asdsted in writing
his plays ε “ licet Terentii scipta ad Sdpi-

onem At'ricannm referantur, quae tamen ’

sunt in hoc genere elegantissima '’ (Quintil.
x. 1. 100). “ Terentium cujus fabellae
propter elegantiam sermonis putabantur a
C. Laelio scribi ’' (Cic. ad Att. vii. 3).
Donatus, in his life of Terence, quotes the
authorities of Q. Memmius, the orator, and
Nepos t'or the same faet3 and he himself
allude-s to it as a matter cast in his teeth by
his adversaries, but ss one of which, if it
were true, he should have more reason to
be proud than ashamed. See Prologus to
Adelph. and Heautont. But there is no
patchwork in Terence's plays. No help he
could have had from any one would account
for the uniform elegance of language, pathos,
good teste, wit, and humorous pictum of
real life and nature, that appear throughout
his writings. Afranius (in Suetonius' life,
c. 5) says, “ Terentio non similem dices
quempiam.” There are few like him now.
His name was P. Terentius Afer. He was
a slave in the family of one P. Terentius
Luoenus, whose praenomen and gentile
name he took on his manumission, retain-
ing as a cognomen the name which he de-
rived from the place of his birth, Carthage,
if the accounts we have of his life be cor·
rect. The plays we have of his are all ⁸ pal-
liatae’ derived more or less stom the Greek,
chiefly of Menander.

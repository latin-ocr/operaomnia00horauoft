HORATII FLAGOI

Pupillis quos dura premit custodia matrum3
Sic mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora, quae spem
Consiliumque morantur agendi naviter id quod

Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque,

*25

Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit.

Restat ut his ego me ipse regam solerque elementis.
Non possis oculo quantum contendere Lynceus,
Non tamen idcirco contemnas lippus inungi;

Nec quia desperes invicti membra Glyconis,

if she was expressly authorized by the will:
they were often named by the testator him-
self, or he authorized some one else to ap-
point. If a man died intestate the nearest
⁴ agnatus,’ male relative, or several if there
were several in the same degree, became
‘ tutores ' to his childreng and if he had
none, or if they were disqualified, the
Praetor urbanus found ‘tutores' (see Diet.
Ant. art. ‘ Tutor’). Thus ⁴ tutela’ and
⁴ custodia ’ were different things. ⁴ Tutela '
was a technioel term, ‘ custodia' was not.
25. locupletibus aeque, ] ‘Aeque’ is
repeated though not wanted, just as ‘inter'
is repeated in S. i. 7, and elsewhere (see
note). Ven. 1483 has‘ locupletibus. atque
aeque neglectum ς’ and some other editions
have the same. But it does not get rid of
the repetition, and is a vile reading. Taci-
tus (vit. Agric. xv.) has ‘¹ aeque discordiam
praepositorum aeque concordiam subjectis
exitiosam,'' where some persons have pro-
posed to read ‘ atque ' in the second clause.
Ovid has—
“Et pariter Phoebes pariter maris ira re·
cessit n (Met. xii. 36);

and again :—
“ Cantanssignpssriter, pariter data pensa tra·

Fallitur ancillae decipiturque labor.”
(Trist. iv. l. 13.)

Τῑιθ Greek writers used ὁμοίως in the same
way, as Xenophon (Hieron. x. ὃ), τοῖς ἐν
τῇ χώρᾳ ἐργάταις καὶ κτήνεσιν οὗτοι ἂν
εἰκότως καὶ θάρσος καὶ ἀσφάλειαν 61¹1-
ναιντο μάλιστα παρέχειν, ὁμοίως μὲν τοῖς
σοῖς ιδίοις ομοίο ς δὲ τοῖς ἀνὰ τὴν χώραν.
See also Plato (Symp. Ρ. 386), ὅθεν δὴ
ξυμβαίνει αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἂν τύχωσι τοῦτο
πράττειν ὁμοίως μὲν ἀγαθὸν ὁμοίως δὲ
τούναντίον.

27. Restat ut his] Horace says he is
impatient till he shall have reached the
perfection of active virtue· and wisdom.
But meanwhile all he can do is to regulate

30

and comfort his mind with such elementary
knowledge of truth as he possesses, and be
content with that; for if he cannot resch
perfectiori he may make some steps towards
it. ‘His’ means that which he has at his
command. The keen sig ht of Lynceus,
who, as the story goes, coissd from Lily-

haeum count the number of vessels in
a fleet coming out of the hux-bour of
Carthage (Vel. Max. i. 4. 8), has been
proverbial in all ages. The reading of
nearly every MS. is ‘oculo quantum con-
tendere! Lambinus, on the authority of
one„edited ‘oculos’ Bentley,
ledging that ‘ oculo

schow-

construction, follows Lambinus for an odd

reason:—“ Pluralis hic numerus arridet 'd

magis quia noster utrumque oculum collyrio
inungere solebat ut Serm. i. 5 :—

⁴ {filie oeulis ego nigra meis collyria lippus
nere.’

Nollet ergo singulari ambigue ufi.’'

30. invicti membra Glyconie,] Aaou
says this person was “ athleta quidem for·-
tissimus ;'' end in the Anthologia (Bruuk.
Anal. vol. ii. p. 126; ΕΡ. 68) there is an
Epigram of Antipater of Thessalonica on
one Glyco, an athlete of Pergamum, whom
he calls ὁ παμμάχων κεραυνός, ὁ what-iic
πόδας, <indura νικῶν, sarh. This Glyco
Lessing (Op. vol. viii. p. 526) has made
out to be a contemporary of Horace, aad
the person here alluded to. The· Fal-nese
Hercules is the production of Glycon, the
sculptor of Athens, and some have supposed
Horace to refer to this statne which they
imagine may have been known as the Her-
euleu Glyconis, as we call it for distinction
the Farnese Hercules, and that Horace
called it briefly the Glycon (Spence, Polym.
p. 115). This conjecture is not without
ingenuity, for it would hardly be possible
to conceive a more prodigious representation
of muscular strength and power of limb
than this statue affords, and Horace was

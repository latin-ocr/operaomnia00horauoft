108 HORATH FLAGGI

GARMEN XL

The date of this ode has been much discussed. If any argument could be founded upon
the first line, it would naturally be infern-ed that the Cantabri and the Scythian tribes were
in arms at the time it ww written. Lentulus' expedition against the tribes of the Danube,
who had invaded the Roman provinces is supposed, as 1 have said before (C. 9. 23, n.),
to have taken place while Augustus was in Spain. Supposing this to be alluded to, the
date of the ode may be considered settled within a year, that is, it must have been written
about A.u.c. 729; and Horace speaks of his grey hairs (v. 15), which is consistent with
that date, for he was then forty. But the date of the expedition of Lentulus is uncertain.
The only authority on the subject is Florus (v. 12), who does not mention the date or
give any clue to it (see C. iii. 8. Introd.). But asterallit is not necessary to suppose that
Horace meant any thing very definite by thus coupling two disum: and uonblesomo ene-
mies together. The name Scythian was applied 1ο a great many people, some of whom
were continually giving trouble to the Romans3 and as Estre says (p. 414) if Horace had
said,

ARGUMENT. ι,

Never mind what distant naticns are about, nor trouble thyself for the wana of ὡς,
which wants but little: youth is going and age approaching: the flowers and the ηοω ,
are not always 111-13111. why worry thyself for ever? Let us drink under the ehtde uf ³

 

GARMINUM I. 3. 13

The date of thisode has been much discussed. It is the chronologists' stumbling-block.

,If it was written on the occasion of that voyage ιο Athens from which Virgil only

returned ιο die, the date must be mmm-¹735. How that interferes with the reckoning of
Franks and others may be seen by referring to the introductory remarks to this edition.
Franks however denies that this ode has reference ιο that voyage. He even thinks it
doubtful whether it is addressed to Virgil the poet 3 and though he is in general very
acute and judicious, his zeal for the theory he advocates ran away with his judgment
when it led him ιο think that Quintilius, whose death is lamented in C. 24 of this book,
is the person here addressed, aud that perhaps he was drowned on the voyage, since it is
clear, says he, from that ode that he met with an untimely and violent death. Coming
from most other people this theory would not be worth menfioning. That it is the resort
of an advocate iu difficulty is clear on the face of it. He thinks these two odes are closely
connected, though the link has been lost to us imm the obscurity of the allusions, but he
finds a truce of it in the words “Navis quae tibi creditum Debes '’ (v. 6 of this ode);
and 24. 11, “Tu frustra pius heu! non ita creditum.” There is no weight in this argu-
ment at allg nevertheless there is no certainty that the ode was written on the occasion
supposed. Virgil may have made or contemplated a voyage before his last, and there is
ao much difficulty attending the date A.u.c. 735 that 1 am inclined ιο think such
must have been the case. This leaves the date of the ode in uncertainty. Franke’s best
argument is that if the publication of these odes took place aster Virgil’s death, it must
have been immediately or very soon aster, even according ιο the chronology of Kirchner

⁷ and others who are opposed ιο him3 and that it would have been in the worst taste and

feeling to have inserted this ode at such a time. There can be little doubt 1 think but

he would have suppressed it, or accompanied it with one expressing his own and the v

universal sorrow. 1 cannot imagine a greater mockery than the insertion of au ode ad·

- arenul ιο Vix-gil on the death of his friend, and an ode praying for his safe voyage, at a

time when an Virgil's friends must have been bewailing his death, to which no allusion is
made in any part of Horace’s writings. This last fact would be accounted for if we sup-
posed Vix-gil to have died during the time when Horace had almost if not entirely suspended
this kind of writing. Franke's attempt to show that there was not that mutual affection
between Vin-gil and Horace which would warrant the expressions in this ode is very weak.
But others have affirmed the same because Virgil no where mentions Horace, and because
he did not leave him his literary executor, but chose Varius and Tucca rather than
Horace. But Virgil lest his Aeneid not ιο be published but destroyed, and there is no
reason why he should have chosen Horace for such a purpose. A man may have more
friends than executors, and does not always give that office to those he loves best. As for
the other argument, if the nature of Virgil’s poems be considered, it is not worth noticing.

Compare with this ode Statius¹ ⁴ Propempticon' to Metius Celer, ⁴ a most noble and
pleasant youth,' whom as he could not accompany he sent upon his way with a beauti-

tful addi-ess, suggested partly it would seem by this of Horace (Sylv. iii. 2).

ARGUMENT.

We commit to thee Vix-gil, Ο ι1ιοιι ship3 deliver him safe on the shores of Attica,
and preserve him whom Ι love as my life; and may the skiae and winds prosper
thee. Hard and rash was the man who first tempted the sea and defied the winds.
In what shape should he fear the approach of death who unmoved could look on the
monsters of the deep and the swelling waves and dingerous rocks? In vain
did God separate lands if man is ιο leap over the forbidden waters. So doth he ever
rusb into sin. Prometheus brought fire into the world, and with that thest came all

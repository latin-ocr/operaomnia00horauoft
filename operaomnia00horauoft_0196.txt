HORATII FLAOGI

Sume, Maecenas, cyathos amici
Sospitis centum et vigiles lucernas

Perfer in lucem3 procul omnis esto .

Clamor et ira.

Mitte civiles super urbe curas :
Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen,
Medus infestus sibi luctuosis

Dissidet armis,

Servit Hispanae vetus hostis orae
Cantaber sera domitus catena 3
J am Scythae laxo meditantur arcu

Cedere campis.

⁴⁴ —- cujus patriam titulumque senectus
Delevit multa veteris fuligine testae.”
13. amici Sospitis] This is a Greek
construction, which occurs again in C. iii.
19. 9, 10. See Theoc. xiv. 18:

ἔδοξ’ ἐπικεῖσθαι ἄκρατον
ὧτιῖκος ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος· ἔδει μόνον ὦτινος
ειπην.

 

— Horace’s request may amount to this, ⁴ pray

that my life may be prolonged a hundred
Ξὲῗεέἑξζῗῗῖᾱίηὲ ιο that of Ovid (Fast. iii.

⁴⁴ Sole tamen vinoque calent, annosque pre-

Qucgegilirmunt cyathos, ad numerumque
Inverliilgsuilliic qui Nestoris ebibat annos,

Quae sit per calices facta Sibylla suos.”

14. viyiles lucernas Perfer] The pre·
ponderance of authority is in favour of
⁴ perfer.’ Orelli’s zurich and some other
MSS. have ⁴ profer! Forcellini, who gives
no signification of ⁴ perfero ' that would suit
this passage, quotes from Cicero (de Fin.
iii. 22. 76). ⁴⁴ beatam vitam usque ad illum
a Cyro exstructum rogum protulisset,”
which is precisely the same ; but Orelli says
⁴ pertulisset ' is the proper reading, and so
Ernesti has it, but says the other would do.
It is impossible to decide the question upon
its mex-its, and the MSS. are not safe guides
in such a matter. The abbreviations for
‘per’ and ‘pro' are nearly the same, as ob-
served by Mr. Long on Cic. Divin. in Q.
Caecil. c. 12. The objection taken to ⁴ pro-
fer ’ is that ⁴ in lucem proferre ’ means ⁴ to
bring to light.’ But in this place there
could be no confusion. In C. iii. 21. 23 we
have ⁴⁴ vivaeque producent lucernae,” where
‘vivae ' corresponds to ⁴ vigiles ² here. Virgil

uses ⁴ ferre ’ unoompoundod in Aen. ix.
ἕξει “ aequasset nocti ludum in lucemque

“ set.’

17. Mitte civiles] See Introduction m·-
specting the historieal allusions in this and
the next stanza.

19. sibi] This word is so placed that it
may depend on ⁴ infestus,¹ ⁴ Immonis: or
⁴ dissidet! 1 prefer the first. Bentley with
little authority makes these adjectivae
change-casea.

22. catena ,·] See above (055. 13. 18, n.)-

23. Scythae] Franks supposes these to
be the Scythiam who had helped Puram..
Orelli and Dillenbr. imaginethem to be fin
Geloni and other trans-Danubiau tribes. 1
believe Horace meant no more than gene-
rally to say that the cneinies of Rom were
no longer disturbing her.

26. Parce privatus] This 1 take tenena
no more than I have expressed iuthe Argu-
ment, not ⁴⁴ cum sis privatus,” as Orelli says,
referring to Maecenas' refusal to se-
natorial rank (C. i. 20. 5, n.). Bentley
opposes ⁴ privatus ' to ⁴ populus) and ex·
plains ⁴ since you have no cause tu be
anxious about public affairs do not be too
anxious about your own,' aad this may be
the meaning. 1 am not certain os myown in-
terpretation,but Ι feel sure Orelli's is wrong. .
In the next verse there is a contest in the
editions and MSS. between ⁴ cape ’ aad
⁴ rape! Bentley defends the former because
it is not usual to snatch a gist, bnt only to
take it quietly. His arguments will not osten
bear being translated into English. Orelli's
MSS. all have ⁴ oepe :' but they siz-angel!
omit the conjunction at the end of the verse,
transferring it to the pmceding line, where
it is not wanted ; but there it ap in all
the MSS. except one of Bentley's, and all
the editions tiu Lambinus' second edition.

HORATII FLAOGI

ALTERA jam teritur bellis civilibus aetas,
Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit ς

Quam neque finitimi valuerunt perdere Marsis
Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenae manus,

Aemula nec virtus Capuae nec Spartacus acer 5
N ovisque rebus infidelis Allobrox,

Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube ·
Parentibusque abominatus Hannibal,

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas,-
Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum. lo

Barbarus heu cineres insistet victor et Urbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula,

Quaeque carent ventis et solibus ossa Quirini,
Nefas videre! dissipabit insolens.

Forte quid expediat communiter aut melior pars 15
Malis carere quaeritis laboribus:

l. Altera] The last being that of Sulla.

2. Suis et ipsa] Porphyrion quotes Livy,
Pref.: “jam magnitudine laboret suass 'and
the commentators have gone on quoting
those words ever since. But Livy's mean—
ing and Horace's are not the same. What
Horace says may be true of any state that
turns its arms against itself. Livy’s words
belong only to one that aims at universal
dominion, and falls under the weight of its
burthen. The practice of quoting passages
for the sake of a little verbal similarity can
do no good and often misleads.

4. Porsenae] Though Niebuhr contenda
that the penultimate syllable of this name
is long, it is here short, and is so used
repeatedly by Silius (B. P. viii. 391. 4803
x. 484). The losty language and tone held
by the Campanians after the battle of
Cannae-how they expected that Hannibal,
when he withdrew to Carthage, would leave
Rome a wreek and the power over Italy in
the hands of Capua, and demanded as a
condition of their assistance that one of the
Consuls should always be a Campaniam—is
related by Livy (xxiii. 6). As to ‘ Spartacus'
see C. iii. 14. 19. The Allobroges, whose
country lay on the left bank of the Rhone,
between that river and the Isere, had
ambassadors at Rome at the time of Cati-
line’s conspiracy praying for redress for
certain grievances. These men were tam-
pered with by the eonspirators, and pro-
mised to forward their designa, which, soon
repenting, they betrayed, and became the
principal witnesses against the conspirators

(Sall. Cat. 41; Cic. in Catil. iii. 2—4).

This explains Horace' s meaning. Two ’

years afterwards these people, having broken
out in war and invaded Gallia Narbonensis,
were defeated by C. Pomptinus, governor of
that province. Their restlaesness is men-
tioned by Caesar (B. G. iv. 5).

8. Parentibus] This I understand lite-
rally as “bella matribus detestata'’ (C. i.
l. 2⁴). Orelli and Dillenbr. take it without
doubt for the Romans of a former day,

‘our fathers! Doering takes it in the
other sense.

ll. Barbarus] This has been referred
to the Egyptians, and taken as evidence of
the ode having been written in the last war
with M .Antonius, which is not worth attend·-
ing to. ‘Insistere' isfollowed bytheaoeun-
tive case sometimes; ForcelL says when it
implies motion, as ‘insistere viam‚’ and
which peculiarity is found in the Greek
καθέζομαις but that signifioetion is not
very marked in this passage, which he does ’
not quote. It more usually governs the
dative case, or is followed byu the ablafive
aster‘ in! See Aen. vi. 563· “Sceleratum
insistere limenl’ Ezekiel’ s prophecy against
Tyre declares that Nebuchadnezzar‘ ‘with
the hoofs of his horses shall need down all
her streets'' (xxvi. 11); and Jeremiah ex-
claims: ‘⁴ At that time they shall bring out
the bones of the kings of Judah, and the
bones of his princes, and the bones of the
priests, and the bones of the propheta, and
the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
out of their graves, and they shall spread

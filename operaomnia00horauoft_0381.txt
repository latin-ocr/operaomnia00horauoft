SATIBARUM Ι. 3.

Natura, aut etiam consuetudo mala; namque
Neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris.

Illuc praevertamur, amatorem quod amicae

Turpia decipiunt caecum vitia, aut etiam ipsa 11300

Delectant, veluti Balbinum polypus Hagnae.

At pater ut gnati sic nos debemus amici
Si quod sit vitium non fastidire: strabonem

quicquam abstuli: agedum Excutedum pal-

so called was included, we are told, in the

(Appiamiv. 50), and this person 1133, without
any authority, been identified with the man
of thia Satire. (Spohn 13 Jahn' s 2nd Edit.
31Ηο130οΛ1Η253) Iam surprised Orelli
should quote this opinion without reproving
it. Another of the same name is mentioned
by Cicero (Ad Att. xiii. 21). Ε3116 suggests
that Hagm may have made up to Balbinus
by her money for the ugly defect in her
nose, which is a libel on the worthy lover,
the blindness of whose affection is held up
to imitation. Bentley has shown sufficiently
from inscriptions and etymology that Hagma,
derived from ἁγνὴ, 033301 properly be

Venus had the epithet ‘ pacta ¹ applied to
her. Ovid (A. A. 661): “Si paeta aet

Pliny mentioning. observes that man is
the only animal that squints (N. H. xi.

were also cognomens. Sisyphus was the

for himself. If it be, as Ι suppose, that the
commentator’s original merely told how the
little man paid court to his master and mis-
tress (ut iis velificaretur), it is a curious
specimen of the way 13 which Scholiasts’
anecdotes are manufactured. He says “ipse

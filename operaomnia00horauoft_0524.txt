long experience that all the testaceous tribe
are fuller, fatter, and more delicate during
the new and full moon than in the first and
last quarters'’ (vol. i. p. 244 . So that
modern observation is in con ormity with
that of the ancients. The above writer
accounts for the fact “by the tides and
currents which set in stronger in the new
and full moon, and bring with them large
quantities of bruised fisheS‚ insecta, fruits,
and other fattening nurture.’'

32. Murice Baiano] This shell-fish, from
which a purple dye was obtained, was found
it seems in great abundance at Baiae. It
would seem not to have been as useful for
the table as for its dye. It is thus de-
scribed by Swinburne: “The body oonsists
of three parts; the ⁴lowest, containing the
bowels, remains fixed 'm the twisted screw
at the bottom for the purpose of pei-forming
the digestive functions; it is fleshy aud
tinged with the colour of its food. The
middle division is of a callous substance
and full of liquor, which, if let out of its
bag, will stain the whole animal and its
habitation. The third and upper part is
made up of the members necessary for pro-
curing food and perpetuating the race. The
murex generally remains fastened to rocks
and stones. The proper season for dragging
for this shell-fish was in autumn and winter.
To come at the liquor the shell was broken
with 000 smart blow, and the pouch ex-
tracted with the greatest nicety by means of
a hook. If the shells were of 0 501011 size
they were thrown by heaps into a mill and
pounded ” (1. 239). The ‘ peloris,' which
was found in the Lacus 1101111005,ὠοεο to
Baiae, appears rmm Martial to have been
an insip id fish, though Catius says it is
better than the murex. “Tu Lucrina voras,
me pascit aquosa peloris’' (vi. ll). “Et
fatuam summa coenare pelorida mensa’ '.(x
37). The rival 075001·- -beds were in the
Lacus Lucrinus and at Circeii, the opposite
point of the bay which is terminated by the
promontory of that name in Latium and
the promontory of Misenum in Campania.
Catius givoe the preference to the oysters of
Circeii, which Pliny also says were 00501·-
passed (xxxii. 21). See note 011 Epod. ii.
49. The best oysters, however, were found at
Brundusium on the other coast, from whence
the spawn was carried to stock the beds on
the coast of Campania and Latium.

34. Pectinibue patulis] The shell- fish
called ‘Jpecten it seems, was found in
greatest perfectiori at Tarentum. Swin.
burne gives a list of shell- fish found iu
the Tarentine 1100015,ωο in number
to 93. Pliny (xxxii. 11) says the ‘pecten’
was also found in great abundance and
per-fection at Mytilene. It must have
been one of the bivalved sort, 0011011 by
Aristotle ἀνάπτυχα, as opposed to those
that were μονόθυρα (Hist. Anim. iv. Δ).

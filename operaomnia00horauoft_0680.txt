650 - HORATII FLACGI

EPISTLE XX.

With this composition addressed to his book (which can hardly be any other than this
collection of Epistles) Horace sends it forth ιο take its chance in the world. He ad-
dresses it as a young and wauton maiden eager to escape from the retirement of her
home and ιο rush into dangers she knows nothing of. He tells her it will be too late to
repair her error when she discovers it; that she will be caressed for a time and then
thrown away, and, when her youth and the freshness of her beauty are gone, she will end
her days in miserable drudgery and obscurity. He concludes with a desoeiption of him-
self, his person, his character, and his age. It is assumed with much confidence by
Franke that the Epistle was written on Horace's birth-day, eth December, Δ.υ.ο.’ 734, tho
year after that referred to at the end. Ι cannot discover on what grounds he rau that
opinion, or why Horace writing on his forty- fifth birth· day should tell the world he was
forty- four the year before. (See note on v. 28.) He was more likely ιο do so on any
other day than that.

ARGUMENT.

My foolish book, thou art oesting glauces at the stalls : thou hatest the, safeguards that
should keep thee chaste, and wouldst fluunt in the public eye. well, go whither thou
wilt3 but return there is none. ‘ Ah! what have I done ?’ thou wilt cry when they
shall hurt thee, and thy lovers shall be wearyand cast thee aside. If I am a ine
prophet thou shalt be loved while youth is thine, but when thou art old and worn they
shall leave thee to decay, or send thee into exile far away. Then shall I laugh at thee
as the man who thrust his obstinate beast upon the rocks; for who can save him that is
resolved to perish? And thy toothless age shall come to teach the elementa to babes.
Or if ever the noon-day heat shall have brought thee listeners, thou wilt tell how
1 stretched my wings for a holder night, and won the applause of the great in the city
and in the field, · Ι, the humbly born, of mean aspect, grey before my time, fit-but fur
sunny elimes, of hasty spirit, but ever ready to forgive. And if perchance theyuk
the number of my days, thou wilt say that forty winters and four 1 did accomplish in
that year when Lollius got to himself Lepidus for his colleague.

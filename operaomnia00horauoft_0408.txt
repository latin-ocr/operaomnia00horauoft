seen of this canai, which was nineteen miles
long, and was called' in consequence De-
cennovium. It is also mentioned by Lucan
(iii. 85): ‘⁴ Et qua Pomptinas via dividit uda
paludes.'’ Nero, projecting a junction be-
tween the Lake Avernus and the Tiber,
enlarged this canai (Tac. Ann. xv. 42).
The road may have been defective here-
abouts, as it was the general practice of
travellers to exchange it for the mnal, and
to make the journey by night, as Strabo
informs us in the above passage.

parody of the heroic style, unless it be taken
from some poet. as Ennius.

crowded; the passengers all want to be
attended to at once. They rush on 1100111,
and the boatman, afraid of his craft up-
setting, or wanting to take as few as he ean
for his money, tries in vain to keep them
out. This is one way of taking the words,
which Orelli prefers. It presumes that the
boat was hired by the party, and that they
divided the cost among them. But ‘dum
aes exigitur' seems to mean that the fare
was collected from each passenger, in which
case the boatmen would have an interest 111
taking as many as they could get, and only
the passengers would complain of being
crowded. The collection of the fare and

seventeen miles from the place where they

‘Cerebrosus’ is an old word signifying

tion (Sueton. Vit. Aug. c. 59), and he also
was allowed to wear a gold ring; that
is, he was made 811 ‘eques’ (Dion Cass.
liii. 30. See S. ii. 7. 9, n.). Eusebius re-
18188 that he lost his life by shipwreck.
Pliny (xix. 8. 38) says that Musa was called
in to supersede Aemilius, the former phy-
sician, and that he successfully administered
lettuce to his patient, which the scruples
(⁴ nimia religio ’) of Aemilius had refused
him. Comm. Cruq. says that the disorder
was gout, that Aemilius resorted to heating
remedies. going so far as to line the roof of
his bed-chamber with wool 3 that Musa
came in and changed the whole treatment,

ordered not only cold baths, but gargles of
water from Atella (in Campania) and cold
drinks, by which means he soon cured him.

For this service 118 was presented, the
Scholiast goes on to say, with forty millions
of sesterces by a senatus consultum. From
Dion (53. 30) we learn that Musa attended
Marcellus. If so it is surprising that he
allowed him to go to Baiae, where Marcel-
lus died. Propertius says of the waters,—

“At nunc invisae magno cum crimine

Ωιξέωέἐιιε, 111 vestra constitit hostis
His {triggua Stygias vultum demersit in
un as,

Errat et in vestro spiritus ille lacu.’'

Τ118 death of Marcellus may have contri-
buted to making Baiae unpopular for 8
time, but it soon recovered its character
(see above, Epp. l. 83). There are some
fragments of medical works by Musa still
extant, and he is frequently referred to as
an authority by Galen. The order of the
names is inverted, as in C. ii. 2. 33 11. 2.
3. et tamen illis Me facit innixum]
‘Though it is all Musa’s fault, he makes
Baiae hate me as if it was mine; that in-
stead of enjoying her pleasant climate and
warin baths, 1 am being drenched with cold
water in the middle of winter.' This seems
to be Horaee’s meaning, and he goes on to
say that the town is angry with all the

10

patients for deserting it. ¹ Μαι-1818 ’ means
groves in which houses were erecoed over
sulphur springs for vapour baths.

8. Qui caput et stomachum] A douche
bath on the head or stomach would now be
thought a strong remedy even by hydro-
pathists ; but it is one of those which Musa
recommended and Celsus likewise (i. 43
iv. 5 .

9.) Clusinis Gabiosque] Clusium (61111181)
was one of the chief towns of Etruria, the
1181 ...8181110188
their siege of Rome (Liv. v. 33). It was
8111181811 011 1118 Via Cassia, about 100 miles
north of Rome. The river 6181118 (la
61118118) flows by it, forming nearly a com-
plete communication between the Arno and
the Tiber. The Clusine marshes, which,
according to Tacitus (Anu. 1. 79), it was at
one time proposed to drain into the Arno,
were formed by the overflowings of this
river. As to Gabii, see Ep. 11. 7, 11. Fen

Romans went there. Strabo (v. 3) men-
tions several cold streams here called τὰ
’,Αλβουλα which were useful’ 111 many com-
plaints both for bathing and drinking
The baths of Clusium may be those that

Tibullus refers to (iii. 5. 1) :—
“ Vos tenet Etruscis manat quae fontibus

Canem.''

10. deseram-ia] See S. i. 5. 2, 11. 'There
was a branch of the Via Appia at Sinuesa,
leading to Cumae, called the Via Domitian„
but that, as the name shows, was not con-
structed at this time, and probably the
traveller would have to continue along the
Via Appia till he came to Capua, from
whence the Via Campam went to Cumae
to the right, and the Via Aquilia went
straight on to Salernum, and qthe Appia
branched off through Caudium to Bene-
ventum. (SeeS. i. g.5 50. 71.) Thisex-

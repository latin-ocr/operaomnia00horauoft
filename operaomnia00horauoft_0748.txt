Nobilibus trimetris apparet rarus, et Enni

Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis
Aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.
Non quivis videt immodulata poemata juda,
Et data Romanis venia est indigna poetis.

a share of its patrimonyf The meaning' ιε
clear enough from the context. The polite-
ness of the ‘iambus ’ in making way for the
spondee, and giving up some of its just
rights, but not disposed to be so accommo-
dating as to give up the even places in the
verse, seems rather a heavy joke. ‘ So-
cialiter‚' ⁴ in a friendly way,' does not occur
elsewhere.

56. The ‘iambus ' Horace says is not
commonly used in the verses of Accius and
Ennius. Those of the former he calls
noble trimeters‚ by which he means famed.
He was no great admirer of them himself.
The great weight he attributes to the verses
of Ennius arose from the gravity of the
measure, consisting, as v. 260 does, chiefly
of spondees. But the absence of the
‘ iambus‚' in the opinion of Horace, convicts
him either of slovenly writing or of igno-
rance of his art. Bentley puts a full stop
after 4 Enni‚' and changes ‘ missos ¹ into
¹ missus,' making ‘versus' the nominative
case to ‘premit.’ But what is the object
of the sentence he does not say. 4 Hic'

265. an omnes] This, and not ‘at' or
4 et‚' is the reading of nearly all the MSS.
Horace says it is not every critic that can
tell a rhythmical verse from an unrhythmical,

sales.- ·] See Epp. ii. l. 170, n. Horace
never has a word to say for Plautus,
and he here depreciaoes his wit as well ιι
his versification. Both no doubt mud-
polish3 and Horace does not mpla to in-
sinuate (in the above place) that it was only
throughhaste togetpnidthathe mod
out his works so unfinished. But stylo
and his defects were incidental to ‚uie pefiod
and manner of his life. his simplicityand
drollery were given him by nature. 11
Horaoe did not admire Plautus, moreleamed
men did, and Varro was one of them, aad
Cicero another. He says. “Duplex est

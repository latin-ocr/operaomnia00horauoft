CARMINUM 11. 13.

Cautum est in horas: navita Bosporum
Poenus perhorrescit neque ultra 15 .
Caeca timet aliunde fata,

Miles sagittas et celerem fugam
Parthi, catenas Parthus et Italum

Robur; sed improvisa leti

Vis rapuit rapietque gentes.

Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae
Et judicantem vidimus Aeacum
Sedesque discretas piorum et
Aeoliis fidibus querentem

14. Bosporum] The form of theGreek
βοῦς πόρος requires that the name should
be written thus, and not Bosphorum, as it
ia osten spelt.

17. celerem fiqum] C. i 19. 11, n.
Bentley is angry with the old MSS.—“ iras-
cor membranisveteribus''— for having, with-
out exception, this word ‘ celerem‚' and
thinks Horace certainly was not thinking
whathowasaboutifhewroteit. Hethinks
‘reducem’ is a much better word. In a
ling note full of quotations, Bentley does
mamaea Ovid (A. A„ iii. 786) = “Ut celer
nafis utere Parthus equis.” If Horace
cunnbhd, therefore, he was not without a
partitas· in his fall. ‘Reducem' is very
dumsy and without meaning. 1 am not
awue that any editor has adopted the word.
naueh (Crassus, c. 24), deser-ibing the at-
ncksof the mounted Parthian archeta on
theu-myofCrassusontheplainsofMeeo-
potamia, says, ὑπέφευγον γὰρ ἅμα βάλλον-
τες ci Πάρθοι, καὶ τοῦτο κράτιστον ποιοῦσι
μετὰ Σκύθας. The defeat of Crassus lest a
deep andlong impraesion on the Romans.

18. Italum mbm· ‚·] Interpreters differ
as ιο the meaning of this word ‘robnr.'
Some, among whom is Dillmburger, take
it in its plain meaning—rthe power of Italy.
(Rha-s, and Orelli among them, interpret
itthe prisona of Italy, ‘robur' being the
inme given to the inner cell or oens where

” the worst malefmtors were kept. Accord-

ing to Festus, “Robur in carcere dicitur
is lomquo praecipitatur maleficorum genus3
quod ante arcis robusteis includebuurss'
For insiances of this use, see Foroell. The
Scholiasta take no notice of the word. They
probably therefore took the meaning the
other way, which ia the simplest and best.
Lipsius quotoe a passage from Josephus,
from which it ap that among other
things which the Roman soldier carried to
battle with him (an axe, a saw, διε.) was a
dmin to secure any prboner he might take.

To this Horace probably refers in ⁴ oetenasss
and below in C. viii. 22.

21. sur-eae reyna Proserpinae] ⁴ Fur-
vus' is an old word signifying ⁴ dark,' and
is not different from ⁶ fulvus,' except in
usage. It is much used in connexion with
theinfernal deities and their ritea- From
the same root Festus der-ivea ⁴ furiae)
⁴ fuligo: and other words os the same kind.

later notione. In the Homer-ic timoe Ely-
sium was upon earth inthe μακάρων νῆσοι.
(See Odyss. iv. 563, and the Schol. thereon.)
For ‘ discretas} Lambinus and &nquius
read ‘doefflptasl The oldaet Berne MS.
has ‘ diso-ipmsl which is the right form
here, if any compound of ‘aribo’ is so.
Seven of Inmbinus' and two of Cmquius’
MSS. had ⁴ diso-ipfae ;' and lambinus says
that many have it in Lueret. (v. 1440) z
‘¹ Et divisa colebatur discriptaque tellus,’'
where the common reading is ‘ dim· aa
here. ‘Dism-iptas,’ as hmbinus says, is
equivalent ιο διατεταγμένας, a force which
‘daeciiptas’ never could have. And it ia
surprising that in so many plaoee where
that meaning, or some meaning of that sort,
is evidently wanted, editors would “
in pntting ‘describo ’ for ‘discribo' (see
A„ P. 86, n.). In weighing the MS. autho-
rity for ‘discriptas' with that for ⁴ Μ’
we must put those codioee which have ‘de-
scriptas’ in the scale with ¹ discrsptasss and
then the balance is about even. Tine Scho-
liasts all had ¹ discretas,’ and most modern
editions have that reading, which I have
adopted, without feeling certain that ¹ dis-
criptas' may not be right. In Epod. (xvi.
63) we have ‘¹ Juppiter illa piae secrevit lit-

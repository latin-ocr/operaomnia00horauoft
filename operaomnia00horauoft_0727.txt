who quotes the first verse expressly as that which Horace wrote “ in prima parte libri de

the same name.

ARGUMENT.

Ridiculum as a monstrous picture, combining the head of a woman with a body made up
of beast, fowl, and fish, is that poem of which the images are thrown together like a
sick man's dream, whose beginning and end have no connexion.

But poeta and painters may take what liberties they please.

Granted, within bounds3 but not that they should broed monsters, or patch up their
verses with tawdry imagae, out of place, like the painter who stuck in a cyproes in his
picture of a wreck. In short, whatever it is let it be simple and uniform.

(v. 24.) We poets are apt to be misled by some standard of our own. A man tries ιο be
short and becomes obscure; to be smooth and becomes vapid3 to be sublime and
become· turgid3 to be humble and becomes creeping5 to be varied and produces mon·
ster-s. So 111 avoiding one error skill is needed lest we sall into its opposite.

(v. 32.) Neither would I be as that artist who could finish better than any one the small
details of a statue, but could not compooe a whole. Choose your subject according
to your strength. So shall you find words and method, the merit of which is that
it says every thing at the right time, and choosoe its topies with judgment.

=— > (v. 4⁶.) In the choioe and introduction of words too care is required, so that old words

may get new soree from their connexion. Yon may use new words if necessary, pro-
vided you do not exceed, espedally if they be taken from the Greek. Why should not
we do it as well as the poeta of old ? Words drop in time, like the leaves of the forasti
nn things must perish: the greatest works of skill must deeay, how much more must
langnage? But old words will rise up again if fashion wills, for she is the mistress of

(v. 73.) 111 the relation of martial deeds Homer led the way. Then elegy (rame with lamen-
tation and with love, the author of which our critics have not determined. Archilochus
was driven by rage to iambioe, which the stage adopted. To the lyre they sang of
gods and heroes, of fighters and horsae, of love and wine.

(v. 88.) Now if I cannot maintain the distinctions of style, how can Ι be called a poet?
Why should I not rather leam? Comedy is not to be expressed in tragic style, nor
tragedy in comio, though eomedy may sometimesraise her tone and tragedy lower hers.
A poem must be not only fair to look at, but sweet and affecting‚ and must strike the
chord of sympathy. And the language must be suited to the character. For there is
thatin our nature which adapts itselt' to every variety of circumstance, according as the
tongue sets it before us. But if the language and character do not agree it only creates
a laugh.

⁹ (v. 119.) 'rhen again yon must either follow tradition οι· let your fictions be consistent.

Achilles must be the impetuous stem warrior, Medea the savage mother, and so on.
Or if you venture on bringing forward anew character it must be consistent throughout.

{⁷ , (v. 128.) It is not easy to handle subjecta which all may handle. One may more easily

dramatize the fall of Troy than write a new story entirely. B'ut a man may make
common property his own if he does not confine himself to ordinary common-places,
m· follow his author too literally and tie himself down too much. And you must not

⁷ begin ostentatiously, or the issue will be only ridiculous, like that of the mountain in

labour. How simple is Homer's beginning, “ Tell of the man, Ο Muse,” &o- There
is no smoke here coming after the flash, but the light grows upon us ω we proceed in
the shape of beautiful and marveuous talos: he oerries us on rapidly to the eud, omits
what he cannot adom, and so puts his fictions together that there is no inconsistency
throughout.

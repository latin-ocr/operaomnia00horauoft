the stage, but the spectators. The most
famous crocus was that of Mount Corycus
in Cilicia (see S. ii. 4. 68, n.).

82.- Quae yravis Aesopum] Claudius
Aesopus, the tragic actor, was an intimate
friend of Cicero’s, and most of the distin-
guished men of that time. He was older
than Cicero, though the date of his birth is
not known, or that of his death. He was
a freedman of some person ,belonging to the
Clodia gens. Speaking of enunciation
Quintilian applies the same epithet to
Aesopus that Horace does: ‘¹ Plus autem
affectus habeant lentiora: ideoque Roscius
citatior, Aesopus gravior fuit, quod ille
comoedias hic tragoedias egit ” (xi. 3. lll).
Cicero makes Quintus compare Aesopus'
delivery with his own, and speaks of him as
showing ‘¹ tantum ardorem vultuum atque
motuum ut eum vis quaedam abstraxisse a
sensu mentis videretur '¹ (de Div. i. 37).
⁴ Gravis ' is a good epithet for a tragic
actor.

— quae doctus Roscius emh] Q. Ros-
cius, the comic actor, was also an intimate
friend of Cicero, who often speaks of him,
and pleaded a cause for him in a speech still
in part extant. Cicero speaks of ‘⁴ Roscii
gestus et venustas¹' (de Orat. l. 59). and
illustrates the description of Quintilian
given above, “Roscius citatior,” by saying
(de Legg. i. 4) that when he was getting
old “numeros in cantu cecidit ipsasque
tardiores fecit tibias.'' His enunciation was
rapid when he was young, but he was
obliged to slacken it in his old age. The
meaning of ‘ doctus ' can only be explained
of the study he gave to his profession, and

the accurate knowledge he acquired of the
principles of his art. He died about Ass-c.
692, and was enormously rich, like Aesopus,
whose wealth has been referred to on S. ii.

86. Jam Saliare 'Numae carmen] 'rho
Salii consisted of two collegas of twelve
priests each3 one said to have been esta-
blished by Numa on the Palatine hill to
attend on Mars Gradivum the other by
Tullus Hostilius on the Quirinal for the

service of Quirinus. The first were espe- .

cially appointed to preserve the ancilia or
shields of Mars which at his festival at the
beginning of March every year they carried-
in processioa: “ ementes munim cuin tri·
pudiis sollemnique saltatu'’ (Liv- i. 20. See
C. iv. l. 28, n.). These hymns were in
honour of Mars (as seems probable), under
the name Mamurius Veturius. The other
gods were also celebrated. The hymns
were called by the name ‘ammenta' of
which the etymology is unknown. Their
meaning appears to have been very obscure
in later times. Quintilian speaks of ‘¹ Sali-
orum carmina vix sacerdotibus suis satis.
intellecta ” (i. 6). But there appear to
have been those who thought themselves
elever enough to make them out, which
Horace takes leave to doubt. It may be
that popular belief attributed the compo-
sition of these verses to Numa, though

that need not be inferred from what Horace = I'
says. Virgil gives the name of Salii to the ¹

priests of Hercules (Aen. viii. 285), and

describes their hymns in ternis apparently
drawn from the Salii of Mars.

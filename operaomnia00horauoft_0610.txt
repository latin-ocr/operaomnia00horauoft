HORATII FLAGOI

Mille talenta rotundentur, totidem altera, porro et

Tertia succedant et quae pars quadrat acervum.

'3⁵

Scilicet uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos

Et genus et formam regina Pecunia donat,

Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque. “
Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum rex :

Ne fueris hic tu.

34. Mille talenta rotundentur,] On
⁴ talenta ' see S. ii. 7. 89, n. ¹ Rotundo ’ is
not used in this sense elsewhere. Petronius
uses ‘ corrotundo,' and the meaning is the
same as ours when we talk of a round
number: it is a complete number, leaving
out fractions. ‘ Porro ' means ⁴ farther.'
‘ Quadi-at acervum,’ ‘ makes the fourth side
of the square,’ as it were.

36. Scilicet umorem cum dote] All ne·
cessary information on the subject of ‘ dos'
may be found in the Dict. Ant. ‘ Fidem'
here signifies ‘ credit! ⁴ Pecunia ’ is here
personified and made a royal lady, and
Juvenal apostrophizes her thus:

funesta Pecunia, templo
Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum erexi-
mus aras '' (i. 113).

 

Arnobius, writing with the zeal of a cate-
chumen, says: ‘⁸ Quis ad extremum deam
Pecuniam esse credat? quam velut maxi-
mum numen vestrae indicant literae donare
annulos aureos, loca 111 1111113 atque in spec-
taculis prima. amplitudinem magistratus‚”
&c. (contra Gentes, lib. 4, p. 125.) Au-
gustine (de Civitate Dei, iv. 21, and else-
where) speaks of Pecunia as a goddess
worshipped by the Romans; but there is
no foundation for 'this as a literal fact.
Mammon was not more worshipped at Rome
than it is among ourselves. Horace here
repeats in effect what he said in S. ii. 3.
94:
“ — omnis enim res,

Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque

pulchris
Divitiis parent.’'
¹ Suadela' is another form of Suada, who
represented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Per-
suasion. The name, Cicero tells us, was
latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15). Πειθώ was
usually associated with Ἀφροδίτη, 31111 their
statues stood together at Athens, where it is
pretty certain Horace must have seen them.
Ι cannot find that Suada had any temple or
separate worship at Rome. She was sup-
posed to assist Venus in presiding at mar-
riages, and she, the Graces, and Mercury
were the acknowledged companions of that

goddess. Therefore Horace assodates them
here. Cicero tells us that Ennius called
the eloquent M. Cethegus “Suadae me-
dullam ” (Cat. Maj. xiv. 50), ⁴ the marrow
of persuasion.' (See Epp. ii. 2. 117, 11.)

39. Mancipiis locuples] See S. ii. 7.
3, 11. Cappadocia was governed by its own
kings from a very early period. A list of
them is given by Clinton (F. H. vol. iii.
p.⁴1:²›0,Append..)y ThelastwasArchelaus‚
who was appointed by M. Antonius Α. u. c.
718, Ariarathes VIL, ywho represented the
lineal kings of Ca ppadoeia, having boen
deposed and put to death. Archelaus was
king at the time this ep istle was written,
and he reigned fifty years. At his death
(Α. u. c. 770) Cappadocia was reduced to the
form of a Roman province, in the third year
of Tiberius (Tacitus, Ann. ii. 42). He hul
lands and slaves on them, and property of
that sort, but wanted the precious metal.
Ariobarzanes, who was king of Cappadocia
when Cicero was governor of Cilicia, 1.
described by him as ‘rex perpauper' ’(ad
Att. vi. 3). “Nullum aerarium,nu1lum
vectigal habet. Nihil 1110 regno spoliafius,
nihil rege egentius’'· (vi. 1). M. Brutum
advanoed him large sums of money etex.-
orbitant interest, which he was unable to
pay, and Cicero, though he got loo talanta
from him, was unable to extract all the debt,
Cn. Pompeius too was his creditor, and au
he could get was a promissory hond for 20⁰
talents payable 111 six months (vi. 3). Ho-
race advises his man not to let himself 113
as poor as this king. ‘Hic' is an adverb,
like ἐνταῦθα.

40. chlamydes Lucullus, κί’ uiuum]
L. Licinius Lucullus began 1113 public lito
under Sulla, and assisted in checking Mi-
thridates and bringing him to terms, and,
when the war with that king broke out again
after Sulla’s death, was appointed to the
conduct of it, being at the time pro-consul
in Cilicia. His extraordinary successes
against Mithridates and Tigranes, king of
Armenia, are related by Plutarch in his
life of Lucullus. He was prevented from
completing his work by the inti-ignes of
his enemies aud the mutinies of his army,

CARMEN XIV. i «
’τί

That Maecenas was not married, or engaged tc be married, in a.u.c. 720, is inser-d
from the fact that in a letter written in that year to Augustus by M. Antonius he buta
him with carrying on an intr-igue with Terentia (Suet. Octav. 69, quoted by Franks).
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 28) supposes Maecenas did not marry till he had built his house
on the Campus Esquilinus, A.U.c. 721-22. His domestic happiness was not of long
continuance. But he could hardly have come to the end of it when Horace wrote thiu
ode, in which allusion is plainly made to Terentia and her husbaud’s affection sor her
(supposing them to have been married at the time, and not merely betrothed, as Kirchner
imagines). These data leave a wide space for the composition of the ode. The object of
it is to excuse Horace for his indolence in not having finished a poem, or volume of
poems, he had long promised. It is generally assumed that this ‘ carmen olim promissum!
was the book of Epodes we now possess. If so, the ode was not written long bean-o fi
publication of the volume: for if it had long been promised and was anxiously expected

(as Bentley says), we can hardly suppose that after being stirred up by his patron, and with·
the leisure he must have had at his sarm, Horace would have kept Maecenas and au hia-

friends' m further suspense for any length of time, especially when we considerthat tha work
was not an Aeneid, but a mere collection of comparative trifles, some of which mut have
been written early, and of which but few could have eost their author any particular amount
of thought. Now one of these odes at least (C. ix.) was written as late as 723, being eom-

posed immediately after the battle of Actium, and the first is almost univmsuy allowed ,

to have been written just before that battle. The book therefore, under this expla'mfloa
of ¹ promissum carmen,' was not published at the earliest till towards the end of aar-q.
723, and thus the ode apologizing for its delay could not have been written much before
then. Franke assigns two odes (2 and 17) to the following year 724, while this apology
he places in 721-22. In this case Horace must have gone on dawdling with hia book at
a very slow rate, which under the circumstances it is difficnlt to account for.

After all it is doubtful whether ‘ promissum carmen ’ means this book of Epodea.
Doering considers it certain that it was a single poem. (See note on v. 8).

CARMINUM III. 5.

155

Hoc caverat mens provida Reguli
Dissentientis condicionibus

Foedis et exemplo trahentis

15

Perniciem veniens in aevum,
Si non periret immiserabilis

Captiva pubes.

Signa ego Punicis

Adfixa delubris et arma

Militibus sine caede, dixit,

20

Derepta vidi; vidi ego civium
Retorta tergo brachia libero
Porta-sque non clausas et arva
Marte coli populata nostro.

12. Incolumi Jove] That is, says the
Scholiast, while the Capitol is safe where
Jove’s temple stood.

15. exemplo trahentis] Horace means
to say, that Regulus had foreseen the danger
to pomty of a recedent which should

tmuium the p of life upon dis-
hononbleterms. ‘Thisthefar-seeing mind
ot Regulus gun-ded sgainst when he refused
tu agree to dishonorable conditious, und
drewfromsuehsprecedcntaproeageof
rdn upon 'ons to come! ‘Exemplo
Μ’ wnsthereading Cruquius' Scho-
lim fifflowedff‘ adserentig ιιι futurum perni-
dsm rei publime' ',) though no MS. col-
hted ιιι modern fimes has shown that
rading. Inmbinus and Bentley adopt it,
though the latter prefers ¹ exempli trahen-
fn? the genitive of quality. 1 think the
reading 1 have followed, with Orelli and ’311
the old editions, and most of the modern,
isoomet. ‘Sinon periret’ is the hypo-
theticsl example from which the apprehen-
sion is drawn. Dillenbr. and others make
‘habentis’ equivaleutto‘ quitraheretss⁴ see-
l'ng that he would by his example bring.’
But the two pnticiploe coupled by.⁴
annot have the signification one of theet in-

· dioetive and the other of the potential mood.

The Greek example quoted by Dille'ubr.
from Plato's Criton (p. 48) has no force
here, inasmuch as the Greeks were able by

metus of ἄν to show the potential or hypo':
thetim! bearing of a participle and avoid
confusion. Plato's words are, τῶν ῥᾳδίως
&rotumnam καὶ ἀναβιωσκομένων γ ἂν
εἰ οἶυί τε ἦσαν, where the first participle
is equivalent to οἳ ἀποκτιννύασι, and the
”cond to ἀνεβιώσκοντο ἇν,1ιιιί; without
ἅν it could only signify υἳ ἀναβιὼσκονται.

17. Si non periret] There ι3 no autho-
rity for the reediug‘ perirent,y which has

been proposed. The fact is, that the two
first linesof the Ale-ic stunza are composed
of two mensures, the trochaic and
dactylic3 and though Horace usually em-
ploys a spoudee instead of the second tro-
chee, he does not do so here, nor did the
Greeks invnriably: see Alcaeus (Fr. 19
Bergk), τὸ δηῦτε κῦμα τῶν προτέρων
ἄνευ Στίχει, und (Fr. 35) οὗ χρὴ κακοῖσι
θυμὸν ἐπιτρέπην, Προυκὸψομεν γὰρ οὐδὲ ὲν
aaa ενοι.

21.. Der-epta vida· ‚·] The diffaence be·
tweeu this word and ¹ direpta ' is so plain,
that it is singular the latter reading should

here have been admitted. Lambinus first ’

corrected it against all the MSS. he was ac-
quainted with ; for which (h'uquius quarrels
with him, and thinks ‘ direpta ' will do very
well. I believe that the remark made upon
‘ dimoveo' in the note on C. i. 1. 13 (see
also note on C. 1.17 of this book) applies
equally ω’ diripio. ’The difference' is cle-rly
marked ιιι Tacitus (Anu. ι. 2o):⁴ ‘Direptisque
proximis vicis ipsoque Nauporto quod muni-
cipii instar erat, retinentes centuriones
irrisu et contumeliis postremo verberibus
insectantur praecipue in Aufidienum Rufum
praefectum casn-orum, in quem dereptum
vehiculo sarcinis gravant. ” Again (c. 23),

“Tribunos tamen ac praefectum castrorum
extrusere· sax-dnae fugientium ⁴direptae?

‘Deripere’ is to pull down or off,‘ diripere’
to pull in pieoes. The MSS. which are
nearly unanimous in favour of‘ diripere’
here, favour ¹ deripere ' in other places (see
Index).

23. Por-larque non clausas] The same
image of security appears in A. P. 199:

“Et apertis otia portis.”

24. Marte] This belongs to ⁸ populata!
See C. i. 6. ⁶2, n.

he was not necessarily appointed by the
plaintiff 3 while the cognitor had no security
to give, because he was appointed by and
looked upon as the principal, and he was
liable as such (Gaius iv. 97). The obse-
quiousness of the will-hunter was not to be
deterred by such a responsibility. ‘All the
editors but Bentley (and Orelli says he
afterwards changed his mind) take ‘ipse'
with ‘ cognit0r‚’ in which case it must mean
that he was of his own accord (‘ ipse ') to
offer himself to the man as his cognitor,
and see that he got his rights without
any trouble or anxiety. This meaning of
⁴ ipse' is not uncommon. The Greeks used
αὐτὸς in the same way. But it seems
more simple to take ⁴ ipse ’ with what fol-
lows ε “ become his cognitor, and let him
go home, while you yourself persevere, and
hold out for him, whatever the weather
mav be.”

39. seu rubra Canicula] He means in
the height of summer or the depth of
winter. The ‹ssst verse, with the substitu—
tion of Furius for Juppiter, is taken from
Bibaculus of whom much has been said in
the Exc. on S. i. 10. 36. Whether the
other expressions are so, or whether they
are only a parody of his style, or taken
from some other poet, we cannot tell. The
epithet ‘rubra’ for the dog-star, and ‘in-
fantes ' as an ornamental epithet to express
the speechlaesness of the statues are· suffi-
ciently absurd, and the hyperbole is not in
good taste3 there is vulgarity likewise in
‘conspuet.' ⁴ Omaso'aForcellini interprete
‘pro ipso ventre.’ It may be that, but 1
think not. It does not occur elsewhere in
this sense. It usually signifies tripe, a
vulgar dish even among the Romans. (See

Epp. i. 15. 34). Acron takes it for the
man’ s belly.
42. cubito stantem prope tanyena] Per-

sius has the same expression: “Est prope
te ignotus cubito qui tangat'' (S. iv. 34).

44. Plures adnabunt thanai] The tanny
fish is found in large shoals at partimlar
seasons on either shore of the Mediterranean,
into which it comes from the Atlanfic to
deposit its spawn, and pasees through to the
Black Sea. Vast quantities were and still
are caught and salted. ‘Cetaria’ were
artificial preserves into which the fish were
attracted and then taken. Salting- houses
were built hard by. ‘Thinini’ here is put
for the rich foolsy who would be caughtpu by
the servility of the fortune- hunter.

46. sublatus] This sense os‘ tolleress to
educate, bring up, is said to be taken from
the practice of fathers taking up in their
arms immediately after their birth such of
their children as they wished to be rem-ed,
while the others they left to be exposed.
See Terence (Heaut. iv. l. 13).

“.So Meministin' me esse gravidam, et
mihi te maximo opere edicere

Si puellam parerem nolle tolli? ch. Scio
quid feceris,

Sustulisti.”

In Plautus (Trucul. ii. 4. 45) it is coupled
with ’θάιιωιθ·’ “Si quod peperissemnd
educarem ac tolleremss’ It is not to he
supposed that the exposure of children or
infanticide‘ ιιι any form was lawful at Rome3
but it is probablye that it wss practised ¹70
some extent even in late times. , = “

47. Caelibie] ‘Caelebs’ is applied ton
widower as well as a bachelor, as in Mutis!
(iv. 69):‘ ‘Diceris hac factus caelebs quater
esse lagenass’ ‘Nudare' Horace uses in
this sense οἳ· exposing' in S. 8. 73.

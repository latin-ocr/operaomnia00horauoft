HORATII FLAGOI

Gausape purpureo mensam pertersit, et alter
Sublegit quodcunque jaceret inutile quodque
Posset coenantes offendere 3 ut Attica virgo
Cum sacris Cereris procedit fuscus Hydaspes

Caecuba vina ferens, Alcon Chium maris expers.

other a Greek, walk in with two ‘ amphorae,'
one of Caecuban‚ the other of Chian wine.
They are represented as coming in in a
solemn and stately manner, like the κανη-
φόροι who carried the baskets in prooes-
sion at‘ the festival of Ceres. (See S. i. 3.
ll, 11.) 011 the Caecuban and other Italian
wines here named, see C. i. 9. 7, 11. Pliny
(xxiii. l) says that Caecuban wine was not
grown in his day, and that the Setian‚
which was highly valued by Augustus, was

15. Chium maris eva-pera] It would
seem, strange as it is, that salt water
was mixed with the sweet wines imported
from the Greek isles. In the treatises de
Re Rust. of Columella (xii. 21. 37) and of
Cato (xxiv. 105) directions are given as
to the proportion that was advisable of
salt water to wine. Columella directs
that the water be boiled down to about a
third part, and that a ‘ sextarius ' of water
be added to an ‘amphora’ of wine, which
is about the proportion of a pint to six
gallons. Some, he says, add even two
or three ⁴ sextarii,' and he would like
to do the same if it could be done with-
out betraying a saline taste. Cato has
given receipts for cooking (as it is called)
native wines so as to imitate the Greek, and
salt water forms an ingredient. He sayS,
speaking of one of these compounds z ‘⁴ non
erit deterius quam Coum.’' It is said that
the practice arose out of the circumstance
of a slave, who had stolen some of his
master’s wine, filling up the deficiency with
sea-water, which was thought to have im-
proved the flavour. In Athenaeus (i. 24)
it is said that with some more delicate
wines the proportion of sea-water was only
3³⁶. An accident is said to have led to a
similar improvement in the manufacture of
a certain kind of beer at Newhaven, 011 1116

Sussex coast, which goes by the name of
Tipper ale. ·Whether Horace refers to thia
practice, and means that the wine had not
been prepared, and was of inferior quality,
or whether 116 means that this preoended
Chian had 111 fact never crossed the aeas,
but had been concocted at home, is 1 think
doubtful. Orelli and most of the commen-
tators adopt the first opinion aflaer the
Scholiasta. Ι am more inclined to the

latter. Compare Persius (vi. 39)=

postquam sapere urbi
Cum pipere et palmis venit nostrum hoc
maris expers,'’

 

where he means a learning bred not in
Greece but at home. In Plautus (Curcul.
i. 1. 76) Phaedromus says: “ Ei est
nomen lenae Multibiba atque Mmbibafl
To which Palinurus answers: “ Quasi m
lagenam dicas ubi vinum solet Chium esse,”
as if Chian wine was always ⁶ merum,' ‘ un-
mixed‚' which may help to explain Honce’s
meam .

18. nlgiivitiae miserasl] This exclama—
tion is drawn from Horace by his ffiend'n
description, in which he who knew Nasi-
dienus would see more to call for such
language than lies on the surfaoe. There
has been nothing said hitherto to call forth
particular rema-113 but the impres-ion per·
haps conveyed by what Fundanius has said
was that of vulgar ostentation without taeta
or real liberality on the part of 1116 host.
He perhaps passed bad wine off u'nder fine
names, and offered others which his
knew better than to call for. Heindorf
takes up the interpretation of some of 1116
earlier commentators, and gives ‘divitias
miseras ’ to Nasidienus, as if while display-
ing his riches he pretended to sigh over the
anxiety they eost him. There are many
obvious objections to this, and there is no
doubt that the exclamation is that of him
who has been listening to Fundanius’ nar·
rative. It was money that had brought 1116

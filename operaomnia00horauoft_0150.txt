HORATII FLAOOI

Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis
Auspiciis veterumque norma.

1. Jam pauca aratro] Tiberius (see
Introduction) complained to the senate
that Rome was entirely dependent on the
provinces for her corn, and was at the
mercy of the winds and waves, which might
at any time cut off the supply and reduce
the citizens to live 011 their ornamental

woods and country honses. (Compare Sall.
Bell. Cat. 13.)

2. undique latius] The Scholiasts have
strangely misunderstood these words, join-
ing ‘latius' with ‘visentur,' as if Horace
meant ⁸ the expanded waters of the Lucrine
lake will be overlooked more widely,' i. e.
from lofty houses built on its banks. Cicero
(ad Att. i. 18, 19, 20) complains that some
of his contemporaries (⁴ piscinarii' he calls
them) were so devoted to their fish-ponds,
that they cared more for them than for all
the interests of the state, as if this might
fall and they still keep their playthings:
‘⁴ Ita sunt stulti ut amissa republica piscinas
suas fore salvas sperare videantur '’ (18);
and again, ‘⁴ Nunc vero cum-nostri princi-
pes digito se caelum putent attingere si
mulli barbati in piscinis sint qui ad manum
accedant, alia autem negligant, nonne tibi
satis prodesse videor,” &c. (ii. l). Else-
ἕψει-ξ he calls them ‘ piscinarum Tritones ¹

ii. 9 .

5. tum violaria] This is opposed to
‘ tum laurea' (v. 9).

6. Myrtus] This word is of two declen-
sions. So likewise are ⁴ quercus,’ ‘ laurus,'
‘pinus,’ ‘cornus,’ ‘ficus,' and, as Bentley
says, judging from the variations in theMSS.,
‘ cupressus :' but the readings now generally
received all assign the last word to the
second declension. In a very elegant illus-
tration of the ornaments of speech Quinti-
lian has the following passage: “An ego

fundum cultiorem putem in qno mihi quis
ostenderet lilia et violas et anemonas, fontes
surgentes, quam ubi plena messis aut graves
fructu vites erunt? Sterilem platanum ton-
sasque myrtos, quam maritam ulmum et
uberes oleas praeoptaverim ? Habeant illa
divites licet; quid essent si nihil alind
haberent?”(1nst. viii. 3. 8), in which ⁸ myr-
tus ' occurs of the second declension, and
⁸ maritam ulmum ' explains ⁴ platanus cae-
lebs! It seems as if Quintilian had Horace’s
ode in mind.

10. ictum] Some good MSS. have ⁴ ae-
stus.’ · Haud dubie ex interpretation& says
Jani. Lucretius uses ‘ictus' several times ε
“ Qui quoniam quodam gignuntur luminis
(ii. 808), ‘⁴ aestiferum ut tantuudi
Ovi

ictu '’
radiorum exaugeat ictum '’ (v. 612).
also (Met. v. 389), “Phoebeos submovet
ictus '' (not ‘ ignes’). Bentley remarks that
Horace is bolder than any in putting ‘ ictus'
by itself, without ‘solis,’ ‘radiorumssr &c.
But ⁴ fervidos ' is nearly equivalent to, any of
those genitivos

10. Non ita Romuli] Aul. Gellius (ii.
24) introduces his account of certain audent
sumptum-y laws with these words, ‘⁶ Parsi-
monia apud veteres Romanos et victus
atque coenarum tenuitas non domestica so-
lum observatione ac disciplina sed publica ·
quoque animadversione legumque complu-
rium sanctionibus custodita est.''

11. intonsi] The commentators are at
pains to inform us from Pliny (N. H. vii.
59) that the age of shaving at Rome began
ΛΑΜ). 454, when barbers were first im·
poi-ted from Sicily. But the conventional
sense of ‘ intonsi,’ in which alone it could
apply to the Censor Cato, is ‘ antiqui‚¹ as
may be seen by comparing the two verses
of ovid, quoted in the note on C. i. 2. 15.

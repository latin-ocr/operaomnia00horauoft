654 HORATII FLAGCI

was not necessary is plain from Augustus' generosity to Virgil and Varius, noticed in
v. 235, and from the intimacy on the strength of which he was enabled to write ix) the
great man at all in this strain. The parts of the Epistle do not hang together very
closely, especially after the first ninety lines. They consist of complimeuts to Augustum
a remonstrance about the pati-onage bestowed on the old poets; a description of the
rapid growth of art in Greece after the Persian war; a complaint that every body at
Rome has taken to writing verses, whether they can or no;> a commendation of poeta
as good aud useful citizens and contn'butors to the national piety; a history of the
growth of poetry in Italy; a compsi-ison between tragedy and comedy, and a sneer at
Plautus and another3 an account of the troubles of dramatic authors through the eaprioes
and bad taste of their audiences, which at that time is stated to have been especially
depraved3 an appeal to Augustus on behalf of the poets of the day3 and a reproof to
such poets as are unreasonable or officious, aud attempt themes too exalted for them.

How much foundation there may have been for Horace’s remarks about the compara-
tive support given to the old writers and the new it is hard to say. flere appears to be
a little contradiction between this alleged neglect and the universal mania for scribbliug
which he describes ; or else the profusion of bad verses may itself account for the prefer-
ence of those who did not write, for the genius of former days. Horace has not a word
to say for Plautus or for Terence, but rather sneers at the popular judgmeut of them.
We may safely say therefore that this Epistle is worth nothing in point of criticism, and
that it does not raise Horace very high as a guide to the tastes of others. It is possible
an affectation of preference sor the archaic in language may have prevailed‘ ιιι some
quarters; but Horace’ s censure affects those who on sound principles of taste preferred
the vigour of the old writers to the weakness of the new. In short, there' is uo disin-imina-
tion in his statement of the case; in which therefore I do not find it easy to follow him.

There is much polish in the versifioet-ion of this Epistle. The flattery with which it
opens is cleverly written, and the verses towards the end, in which Horace compendiously
states the military successes of Augustus, are terse and elegant. His commendation of
the poet is a fair tribute to his own profession. ΤΙιθ description of the vulgar toste for
spectacles is natural, and reminds us of our own times3 and there is enough in the Epistle
to account for the high estimatiou it is held in by the general reader.

ARGUMENT.

It would be unpardonable in me to detain you, Ο Cacsar, absorbed as you are in the
weightiest cares. Romulus and Liber, the sons of Leda and Hercules, those bene-
factore of mankind, received not while alive the honour due to their great deeds: they
were envied then, but are worshipped now, sor greatnoes scorches those below it; but
when its light is· removed, then it is admired. To you, on the other hand, we render
our homage, even while you are with us, and acknowledge that your equalhas not been,
and never shall be. .

(v. 18.) But they who are herein so wise, are not wize in this, that they like nothing but
what is gone. Such admirers are they of what is old that they declaro the XII Tables
of the laws, the old kings’ treaties, the pontifical books, and the volumes of the audent
bards, to have been inspired by the Alban Muse. But if the same rulo is to be
applied to the Romans as to the Greeks, whose oldest poets no doubt are their best,
then farewell to our senses. No doubt our painting, our music, our wrestling, arebetter
than the Greeks' !

(v. 34.) But if time acts on poetry as it does on wine, what number of years are re-
quired to give it worth? Shall one who has been dead a hundred years be couuted
old or new ? He is old and good. Well, take away a mouth or a year from the hun·

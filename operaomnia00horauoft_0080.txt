50 HORATII FLAGGI

Vns, potabis modicis Sabinum
Cantharis Graeca quod ego ipse testa
Conditum levi, datus in theatro

Cum tibi plausus,

Care Maecenas eques, ut paterni 5
Fluminis ripae simul et jocosa

Redderet laudes tibi Vaticani

Montis imago.

Caecubum et prelo domitam Caleno
Tu bibes uvam: mea nec Falernae lo
Temperant vites neque Formiani

Pocula colles.

1. Vile potabis modicis Sabinum Can-
tharis] It has been said before that Sabine
wine was none of the worst; but it was
cheap and poor compared with the best, to
which Maecenas was used, and this probably
had not had the benefit of keeping. Horace
commenda it therefore by referring to the
circumstances under which it was bottled.
(Ι use that term for the process diffundendi
or condendi for want of a better.) If it
was made on his own farm, which Maece-
nas gave him, this would enh-auce the com-
pliment, which would be increased by his
having done it with his own hand. Jani (a
good scholar, but unwise commentator)
thinks on the other hand Horace meant to
give his friend a hint to bring some better
wine with him—The most ordinary kind of
earthenware jug was called ‘ cantharus’
supposed to be the name of its inventor.
Horace had tried to improve his wine by
putting it into a ‘'testa or ‘amphora,¹
which had contained some of the rich wine
oftheAegaean. (Seec. i. 9. 7, ιι.)

5. Care Maecenas eque⁸‚] Bentley, on
the authority of one MS. of the Royal
Society, edits ‘clare ’ for ‘care.' He admits
that ‘ care' is consistent with the occasion
and the familiar friendship between Maece-
nas aud Horace (C. ii. 20. 7). But he
thinks ‘eques' wants an epithet3 besides
Mart. (vi. 58) has,
⁴⁴ Sospite me sospes Latias reveheris ad

urbes
Et referes pili praemia clarus eques.’'

But the character of the ode and the guest ,

preponderauce of authority in tho MSS.
lead me to prefer the common reding.

Martial was not thinking of Horace or “

Maecenas, but of his friend Aulus Pudens.
A verbal coincidence, however unoonnected
the passages may be in other respectas, is
always enough to furnish Bentley with an
argument in support of a favourite theory.
Maecenas was content with the equestriau
rank and would take no higher: hence the
frequent repetition of the title‘ eques ' by
Horace and others. (See iii. 16. 20, and
his life in Dict. Biog.)
7 . Vaticani Montis imayo.] The diesne
must have been that of Pompey, which was
opposite to the Vaticau hin on the left
bank of the river, the hill being on the right
or Etnmscau bank, which gives propriety to
the words‘ paterni fluminis ripae! Fen
say s he has observed the echoes of seunds
striking on the Janiculum, which was pm
of theg Vatican hill. The an
syllable of Vaticanus is long¹ in Marti-l
and Juvenal. On ‘imago' see above, C.

12. 3, ιι.

10. Tu bibes] The future has here the
same signification as above, C. 6. 1, 7.
l. ‘You may drink if youp plesse the richer
wines.1 have none euch: Respecting the
wines here mentioned see above, C. 9. 7‚n
Some of Lambinus' MSS. had ‘Caecubum'
which J ani says is ‘ ornatius et concinnius,'
and Fea adopts it too. The force of Juni’s
remark is not obvious.

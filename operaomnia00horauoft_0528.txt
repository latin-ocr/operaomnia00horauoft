made up of the above boiled with chopped
herbs, gith a sp rinkling of saffron, and,
when it had stood to cool, the finest olive
oil of Venafrum (C. 11. 6. 16, 8.).

66. Byzantia putuit oreta] The‘ thyn-
nus ’from which the best‘ garum’ was made
was found best in the neighbourhood of
Byzantium (Pliny' lx. 20). ‘’orca is a jar
used for praeerving sauces and pickles.
Suidas derives it from an Aeolic word' ορχητ
ὄρχσι, κεράμινα ἀγγεῖα ὑποδεκτικὰ ταρί-
χων. See Bentley' s note and Forcell.
Nearly yevery known MS. has ‘putuitl
Inmbinus and Torrentius and many of the
old editionshave‘ putruit' (seeS. 3. 194, 8..)
The‘ crocus’ of Mons Corycus in Cilicia
appears to have been most celebrated (Pliny
xxi. 17). ‘Stetit' Comm. Cruq. explains
“ cessavit agitare, fervere.”

70. Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia] The
apples of Tibur and Picenum have been
referred to before (C. i. 7, 143 S. ii. 3.

71. Venucula convenit ollis ,·] This
grape derives its name, Comm. Cruq. says,
from Venusia, which is very doubtful. The
word is variously spelt. Pliny says (xiv. 4.
6), “ Veniculam inter optime deflorescentes
et ollis aptissimam Campani ‚malunt sir-
culam vocare; alii staculamst Columella

served 18 jars for the winter. Pliny (xiv. 3)
says‘ ⁴ahisgratiam, qui etvinis, fumus affert
fabrilis!y For dryin g in this way Catius
says the grape of the Alban hillsy 13 baet.
1113 opinion 13 not supported by any extant
authority, as it 13 18 the other instance.

73. Hauc eqo cum mulia] Catius says
he was the first to introduce Albanian

raisins at the second course, and likewise

‘’faex 88(1“’811,33 two picklae, 83 it would
seem, but Forcellini makes them the same,
being the 1333 of the‘ muria’ (v. 63, n.).
So Pliny describes ‘alec,’ or ‘alex' asitis
otherwise spelt. Speaking of ‘ganum’ 113
says,‘ ‘vitium hujus est alex imperfecta nec
colata faex. ”
ferently applied perhaps. Pliny goes on to
say: ‘Transiit deinde in luxuriam ‹ri-eve-
runtquege nera ad infinitum— Sic alex per-
venit ad ostrea,'' διο. So that it came from
being a poor man’s sance to be 8 rich man’s.
Catiusalsoclaims the mit ofintrodudng
little dishes containing 8 mixture ofsalt and
white pepper. The object of alithin, 83
well 83 the pickles, was to pmmotethirst,
andadd to thepleasureofdrinkingastar
dinner. White pepper, 83 Pliny (xii. 7)
says, is milder than black.1t is made by

blanching the finer grains of the blank and
taking off the' nod. The andent- must 11873
got their pepper nofrom the But Indica. The
best' 13 grown on the Manba- coast.

75. Iam-etum] This comes 811111ι in-
cerno‚' to sift, or ‘inca-nendo spu-gere'
(Forcell.), to seatter with 8 sieve qr ‘inca’-
nieulum. ’ It therefore means that the pep-
per was sprinkled over the salt. The Scho-
liasts interpret it differently: Δια-08· per—
mixtum, ' Porphyrion‘ non aetum) ί811ιί
Forcellini takes it in the latter way,
divisum, confusum, admixtum—ab· moen-uo
sed contraria significatione.” ⁴Catiuus ’ ‘u
a diminutive form of ⁴ eatinus!

76. milia terna macello] 3000 ses-

not perhaps exaggerated. ‘Im-ger 38183

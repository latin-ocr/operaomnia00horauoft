HORATII FLAOOI

Romanoque habitu, prodis ex judice Dama

Turpis, odoratum caput obscurante lacerna,

Non es quod simulas? Metuens induceris atque
Altercante libidinibus tremis ossa pavore.

Quid refert uri, virgis ferroque necari
Auctoratus eas, an turpi clausus in arca,

Quo te demisit peccati conscia herilis,
Contractum genibus tangas caput?

Estne marito

Matronae peccantis in ambo justa potestas?

In corruptorem vel justior.

Illa tamen se

Non habitu mutatve loco, peccatve superne.

but here that garment (⁴ Romanus habitus ')
is laid aside. The man's hair is scented with
perfumed oil, like Varus' in Epod. v. 59.
See Epp. i. 14. 32, n.

59. Auctoratus ea8,] Though gladiators
were sor the most part slaves or criminals,
freemen sometimes sold their services in
this capacity, and they were called ⁴. aucto-
rati,' and the pay they received ‘auctora-
mentum.’ So Suetonius says that Tiberius
exhibited gladiatorial shows to the memory
of Augustus, and Drusus his grandfather,
and to increase the number he hired several
who had received their discharge, ‘⁴ rudiariis
quoque quibusdam revocatis auctoramento
centenum millium '' (vit. Tib. c. vii.). Such
persons bound themselves by a very strin-
gent bond to the · lanista' who hired them.
The words of this bond are given in a
passage of Petronius: ‘⁴ In verba Eumolpi sa-
cramentum juravimus uri, vinciri, verberari,
ferroque necari, et quicquid aliud Eumolpus
jussisset, tanquam legitimi gladiatores do-
mino corpora animasque religiosissime ad-
dicimus.'' The same words Seneca quotes
(Ep. 37): ‘⁴ Promisisti virum bonum, sacra-
mento obligatus es.—Eadem honestissimi
hujus et illius turpissimi auctoramenti verba
sunt uri, vinciri, ferroque necari ;'’ and this
explains J uvenal's ⁴⁴ Scripturas leges et
regia verba lanistae '’ (S. xi. 8). The word
is said to be derived from ‘aneton' in the
sense of ⁴ venditor ¹ from the person selling
his services, that being a particular sense of
⁴ auctor ¹ as opposed to ⁴ emtor.' There is
evidently a connexion between the two
words, but it is not easy to see what it is3
for ⁴ auctor ' is only applied to the seller as
warranting the title.—From the above pas·
sages it is clear that ⁴ uri ¹ is absolute ς it does
not go with ‘ virgis’ as some take it.

60. conscia] See S. i. 2. 130, and
Juvenal (iii. 49): ⁴⁴ Quis nunc diligitur nisi
conscius?’' ⁴ Conscius ¹ means an accom-

plice. The man aeks what differ-enee it
makes whether a freeman goes and lets
himself to a ‘lanista' to be beaten and
tortured at his will, or runs the risk, in
furtherance of his amours, of being shut up
head and heels together in a dirty old chest
by his mistress's slave—girl, to keep out of
the way of her husband.

61. Eetne marito] What were the pm-
visions of the laws respecting sdultervre-
pealed by the Julia lex, passed Α. ιι c. 737
or thereabouts (C. iv. 5. 21), is not known.
That they affected the wife’s1dos'we have
seen in S. i. 2. 131. Gellius (x. 23) quotes
a speech of the elder Cato, ‘⁴ De Dote,” by
which it appears that the husband had then
power to put his wife to death if he caught
her in the act os adultery3 and if so he
must have had that power at the time
Horace wrote, for the law had not been
altered. The words of Cato, who· died ιο.
149, are these: ⁴⁴ Vir quum divortium fecit
mulieri judex pro censore est. Imperium
qnod videtur habet. Siquid perverse teue-
que factum est a muliere, multatur: Si
vinum bibit, si cum alieno viro probri quid
fecit, condemnatur. —In adulterio uxorem
tuam si deprehendisses sine judicio impune
necares. Illa te si adulterares digjto non
auderet contingam neque jus estl' This
Davus would call hard measure against
women. “Ecastor lege dura vivunt mu-
lieres ” (Plautus, Mercat. iv. 5. 3). ’Πιο
partiality which Davus' words impl)⁷ was
corrected by the above law of Augustus,
which gave ythe husband power to kin the
adulterer in certain cases, hut not to kin
his wife. It is clear from this Satira and
the second of the first book that the injured
husband might do pretty much as he plcased,
or was able, to revenge himself on the adul·
terer, without sear of the laws.

64. Non habitu mutatve loco] Davus
says the woman may be bad, but she is not

xxiv IN TRODUOTION .

G. ii. 18.—-This Ode stands alone. 'Ehe metre has its name from
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consists of three trochees, fol-
lowed by a single syllable, long or short : ,

-υῙ-υΙ-υιξί

The second of five trochees preceded by such a· syllable:

εΙ-ψΙ-εΙ-υΙ-ψΙ-σ

C. iii. 12.—This Ode is also unlike any other. It is usual to divide
it into feet called Ionic (υ u - -), of which the two first verses con-
tain four each, and the third two. Respecting this metre see Bentley’s
note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject of an Ode of
Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metre also. The Greek, as usual,
has 3 much finer effect than the imitation.

O. iv. 7.—This metre takes its name from Archilochus, and consiste
of an hexameter verse and the latter half of a pentameter. There are
no other Odes in this measure.

Epod. i.—x.—The first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondeos
only >in the uneven places. An anapaest is once introduced in ii. 35.

Epod. xi. ——This is one of the variations of the iambic introduced by
Archilochus The first verse is a trimeter iambic. The second is ἀσνν-
άρτητος, consisting of the last half of a pentameter followed by 3 dimeter v
iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of vv. 6, 10,
26, and the hiatus in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has 3 note on this metre
which may be consulted.

Epod xiii. —This metre consists of an hexameter verse, with one made
up, as Epod. xi.‚ of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the differ-
ence being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xiv. ., xv.—These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dimeter iambic.

Epod. xvi .—This consists of an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
iambic verse.

Epod. xvii. —This consists entirely of trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

The rule laid down by Meinecke, and adopted by many editors, which ,⁵
affirms that the Odes that consist of single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are to be divided into stanzas of four verses, appears to me too
doubtful to be adopted. '

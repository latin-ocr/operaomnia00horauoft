though they were employed in different
branchos of the public service, they had
intel-ests in common, and must have held
meetings to discuss questions that concerned
their body. As Horace had belonged 10

tion. Suetonius (Octav. 50) says of Au-
gustus, ‘¹ In diplomatibus, libellisque et
epistolis signandis initio sphinge usus oetss’
He asterwards used a head of Alexander,
and latterly a portrait of himself. The
‘tabellae' of the text may have been a
‘diploma’ so mlled from its consisting of
two leaves, by which privileges of some sort
were to be granted. ‘Signum' expmssed
any work sculptured or engraved. Here it

form of a ring. On the subject of rings, of
which a large number of specimens have
been preserved, sufficient information will
be found in the Dict. Ant.; aud whoever
has acce-s to Gorlaeus’ collection of en-
81811888, which he calls Dactyliotheca, with
the commentary of J. Gronovius, will find
a 81881 fund of insormation and amusement
in that work. Alter the conquest of Egypt
the sphinx was a common symbol on seals,
aud Gorlaeus has one in his collection (p.
ii. 190). 811011 au oue is to be found in the
110188 of Burmauu’s edition of Suetonius
(l. c.), with the inscription ‘⁴ CARISIUS. 111

in the time of Augustus. The practice of
kings delivering their rings to those whom
they deputed to represent their own autho-
rity is of the highest antiquity. Pharaoh

delivered his ring to Joseph, and Ahasuerus
to Mordeoei.

have gone upon four wheels, and to have
been, sometimes at lemt, of capacious size,

part of their journey to Brundusium in

44. Thra-2· est Gallina Syro par?]
Comm. Cruq. says “Thrax Gallina fuit
secutor, Syrus autem retiarius, uterque
8181118101.” ‘,Thraces' ‘xsecutorae and

‘retiarIil were three different kinds of
gladiators. The distinctions between them,
and all necessary information about gladi-
ators, may be learnt from Dict. Ant. (art.

‘Gladiatoxiae ’.) The first had their name
from being armed like the Thrau'ans with a
short sword and round shield, from which
they were sometimes called ‘parmulan'L’
See Sueton. Vit.Domit.c.102“Pat1-em-

The MSS. vary between Thrax and Threx.
Torrentius says the oldest MSS. have Threx.
Orelli, on the other hand, says Thrax is
bestsuppo rted. Maecenas is supposedto
ask Horace, among other trifliugq uestions,
whether he has seen the famous rs,
and which* is the better of the two.

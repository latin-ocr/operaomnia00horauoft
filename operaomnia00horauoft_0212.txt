quotes only one other instance of ‘ illaqueo’
from Prudentius, and one of the passive
participle from Cicero. ‘ 1rretio,’ as Orelli
says, is the more common word of the same
meaning.

18. Majorumquesafnes.] Bentley, aster
proposingtoalter‘ majorum ’into‘ ιιιιι]ὀι·1ε,ν
οι· else‘ pecuniam’ into‘ pecunias, ’inorder
that both may be of the same number,
comes to the right conclusion at last, that
‘majorum’ has no connexion with ‘pecu-
niam‚' but is of the neuter gender, as in
Theocritus (xvi. 65), αἰεὶ δὲ πλεόνων ἔχει
ἵμερος αὐτόν. With ‘ tollere verticem'
compare C. i. 18. 153 aud on ‘equitum
decus ’ see C. i. 20. 5, ιι.

21. Quanto quicque sibi] This senfi-
ment approaches as near as 'possible to the
fundamental rule of Christian ethics. ΤῙιθ
accuracy of the picture in the next verses
must not be insisted on too closely. It
would imply that Horace, a wealthy Epi-
curean, had thrown up his riches in con-
tempt, and gone over to the ranks of the
Stoics, as Cicero says (ad Fam. ix. 20)st in
Epicuii nos adversarii nostri oestra con-
jecimus.'’ But, as Horace never was rich,
he never could have acted the desen-ter on
these terms, though he changed his opi-
nions. As noticed before (C. ii. 6, Intro-
duction), Horace may sometimes be sup-
posed to put general maxims in the first
person without strict application to himself.
‘ Nudus’ signifies one who has left every
thing he had behind him. ‘ Contemptae'
Bentley supposes to mean that for which

he (Horace) had a contempt. He means
that the rich man with fine houses had a
contempt for his little property. ‘Con-
tentae' is the reading of a few MSS„ and
is either the origin or gfruit of Aoeon’ s imte,

“compositae et mediocris. ’' It is meant
for ⁴ straitened.' ,

29.1)'urue rivus aquae] The small river
Digentia is that which Horace antidea to.
On ‘certa fides¹ see C. iii. 1. 30, ιι. ‘ Fallit
beatior’ is a Greek construction, λανθάνει

“ Quo magis et nostros contendis solvere
amores

Hoc magis adducta fallit uterque fide.”

‘The more you try to looseu our affection,
the more we each of us, im ” ly to
you, interchange the assui-auce of fidelity.’
Lucan also (vi. 64. 68) has tho samo con-
struction twice :—

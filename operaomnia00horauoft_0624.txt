of this book, Introduction, and note on v. 15. Horace it appears was not in'voey guod
humour with himself when he wrote it. He describes himself ss suffering len stou
bodily than mental weakness, irritability, sluggishness, perverseness, and caprice. He
may use rather stronger language than was necessary, but there ean be no doubt he ‘blt

friends which he cannot steadily apply to himself, and it helps us to understand th-
character of Horace and his philosophical aspiratione described, probably about this fitne,

written in an unkind spirit towards Celsus, which 1 do not understand. The camuel in
the last verse does not imply this. It is advice such as a young man lately promotsd to
an important office might be glad of3 and if the manner seems abrupi: to us it was
nothing at that time probably between friends of whom one was young enough perhaps
to be the othei-'s son.

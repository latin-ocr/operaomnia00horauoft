HORATII FLAGGI

Mutatus Polemon? ponas insignia morbi,

F asciolas, cubital, focalia, potus ut ille

255⁵

Dicitur ex collo furtim carpsisse coronas
Postquam est impransi correptus voce magistri?
Porrigis irato puero cum poma recusat:

Sume, catelle ! negat3 si non des optet: amator

Exclusus qui distat agit ubi secum eat an non

260

Quo rediturus erat non arcessitus, et haeret
Invisis foribus? Nec nunc cum me vocat ultro
Accedam? an potius mediter finire dolores?

Exclusit; revocat: redeam? Non si obsecret.
Servus non paulo sapientior ε Ο here, quae res

Ecce
265

N ec modum habet neque consilium ratione modoque

Tractari non volt.

In amore haec sunt mala, bellum,

Pax rursum: haec si quis tempestatis prope ritu
Mobilia et caeca fluitantia sorte laboret

254. Mutatus Polemon 7] The story of
Polemon is told by Diog. Laert- iv. c. 16,
and mentioned by many authors. As a
youth he was given to pleasures and bad
company. Passing the Academy with a
garland on his head, and with a band of
riotous companions, while Xenocrates was
lecturing, he burst into the school, but was
so struck with what he heard, that having
gone in a thoughtless profligate he came
out serious and quite converted. He suc-
ceeded Xenocrates at the head of the Aca-
demy. Xenocrates himself, whose purity
of life and sobriety of character is referred
to in the word ‘ impransi,' became the head
of the Platonic school on the resignation of
Speusippus. He was the disciple of Plato,
and accompanied him on his travels.

255. Fau-iolas, cubital,socalia‚] These
are all articles of dress, worn only by women
or men who took great care of their person.

‘'Fasciola was a bandag e for the legs,
‘cubital' a sleeve for theg arm, ‘’focale a
bandag e for the throat. See Quintilian (xi.
3144), ‘Palliolum sicut fascias quibus
crura vestiuntur et focalia et aurium 1ἰ38-
menta sola excusare potest valetudo.y
‘’Focale is said to be derived from‘ faux!
It may be so: but it is doubtful. ‘Im-
pransus’ stands for ‘sobriusss because it
was not usual for abstemious men to take
the mid- day meal (prandium). ‘Furtim’
is a happy touch of Horace’ s. It expresses
the shame of the young man, and his in·
stinetive reverence for the philosopher and

s

the place he was in, better than many sen-
tences could have done. ¹ Correptus, '
which Orelli renders ⁴ aci-lter reprehensus,’
⁴ sharply reproved‚’ rather means ⁴ arrested,
conscience-mitten)

259. Sume, catello l] Such diminutives
were expressions of endem-ment. See Plau-
tus (Asin. iii. 3. 76) :—

“ Dic igitur me passerculum, gallinam,
coturnicem,
Agnellum, haedillum me tunm dic esse vel
vitellum ;''

and ver. 103 :—

“ Dic igitur me anaticulam, columbam, vel
Hiruffitiggdff’nmonednlam, passerculum
pu um.

260. aqit ubi secum] With such a scene
as this the Eunuchus of Terence opens, and
a good deal is taken word for word from
that scene. Persius has imitated Horace
closely in his fifth Satire, ver. 161, sqq..

“Davzt cito, hoc credas jhbeo, {inii-e dolores
Praeteritos meditor? διο. The lover-Ns m·
decision is represented elsewhere, in Epod.
xi. 19, sqq. In ver. 262 ⁴ nec nu'nc,’ which
is the reading of all the best MSS„ Bentley
has changed into ⁴ ne nunc,’ with very slen-
der authority. Fea and others have followed
him. The same change has been made iu
the text of Persius (l. c.), where he borrows
these words of Horace. ⁸ Invisis foribus'
Persius turns into ⁴ limen ad obscoenum!

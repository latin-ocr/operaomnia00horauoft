HORATII FLAOGI

⁴ ι ,Majores audire, minori dicere, per quae
α [Crescere res posset, minui damnosa libido.
Mutavit mentem populus levis et calet uno
Scribendi studio; pueri patresque severi

Fronde comas vincti coenant et carmina dictant.

110

Ipse ego qui nullos me adfirmo scribere versus
Iuvenior Parthis mendacior, et prius orto

Sole vigil calamum et chartas et scrinia posco.
Navim agere ignarus navis timet ; abrotonum aegro

Non audet nisi qui didicit dare ; quod medicorum est

115

Promittunt medici; tractant fabrilia fabri ε

Scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim.

Hic error tamen et levis haec insania quantas

Virtutes habeat sic collige : vatis avarus

Non temere est animus; versus amat, hoc studet unum; 120
Detrimenta, fugas servorum, incendia ridet ;

Non fraudem socio puerove incogitat ullam

Pupill0; vivit siliquis et pane secund03

a debtor is said ‘ cavere alicui,' to give
security to his creditor, and the creditor is
said ‘ expensum referre alicui! ‘ Nomen ’
signifies an item or entry in a book of
accounts, and ‘referre nomina’ to make
such entries. It also is used for a debt,
and ‘nomen solvere ’ is to pay a debt;
⁴ nomen facere,’ either to incur a debt or to
lend money3 for ‘facere’ is used in both
senses: but ‘ nomen’ is also used for the
debtor himself, see Cicero (ad Fam. v. 6.)
“Meis rebus gestis hoc sum assecutus ut
bonum nomen existimer.'’ Porphyrion ex-
plains ‘ nominibus rectis' as ⁴ de legibus factis
non de foenerando debitoribus.' He there-
fore read ‘rectis' not ‘ certis,' which appears
in most of the early editions (not all, as
Fea says, for Ascensius, 1519, has ⁴ rectis ⁹)
fill Cruquius restored ‘rectis' from every
one of his MSS. It appears in all Orelli's,
and all but four late ones of Pottier's, and
many others. Bentley from one doubtful
MS. reads ‘ scriptis ' for ⁴ cautis‚’ appealing
to “scribe decem Nerio (S. ii. 3, 69).

111. carmina dictant] ‘ Dictare’ is
equivalent to ‘scribere,’ because they did
not usually write themselves, but dictated
to a slave who wrote. See S. i. 10, 92, n.

113. Parthis mendacior,] This expres-
sion, which seems as if it were proverbial,
savours of the jealousy the Romans of this
day felt towards the Parthians. Elsewhere
Horace calls them ‘infidi,' C. iv. 15. 23.

As to ‘calamus’ and ‘charum’ see S. ii. 3. μ

2, 7, and for ⁴ scrinia’ see S. i. 4. 21, ιι.

114. abrotonum]
which we call southern-wood, and 1 under·
stand it is used in our pharmacopeiaas a
remedy for worms. Pliny (xxi. 21) des-
cribes its use for medical purposes.

117. indocti doctique] See c.i. 1. 29, n. ”

119. avar-ue Non temere eet animm ,·]
Ovid takes credit to poeta for this same
quality: “ Nec nos ambitio, nec amor nos
tangit habendi ’' (A. A. iii. 541). ‘Non
temere avarus’ saems to mean ⁶ not readily
given to avarice.’ In S. ii. 2. 116 he says,
“non temere edi luce profesta Quidquam
praeter olus ’' (see note), and in Epp. ii. 2.

13, “ non temere a me Quivis ferret idem,” ⁷ -Ἴ

where the sense is much the same as here.

122. Non fraudem cocio puerove] See
C. iii. 24. 60, ιι., and aa to ‘pupillo’ see
Epp. i. 1. 21, n. ¹

123. siliquis et pane secundo ,·] ‘ Siliqm’
is the pod or husk of any leguminous
vegetable: but it was applied particularly
to a plant, the ‘ siliqua &22⁶oess which
is still found in Italy and Spain. ΤΙιο

Italian name is ‘ carruba,¹ and the Spanish , ,
pods filled ' ’

‘algari-oba! It produces long
with asweetish pulp. The name is derived
from χαρουβία, which Foroellini says is
derived from κυράβιον, a horn. ‘Panis
sccundus,’ or ‘secundarius,' is breed made
from inferior flour.

This is the plant Δ 1'

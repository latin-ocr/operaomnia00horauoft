EPISTOLARUM I. 16.

629

Da mihi fallere, da justo sanctoque videri,
Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem.”
Qui melior servo, qui liberior sit avarus,

In triviis fixum cum se demittit ob assem,

Non video; nam qui cupiet metuet quoque ; porro,

65

Qui metuens vivet liber mihi non erit unquam.
Perdidit arma, locum virtutis deseruit, qui
Semper in augenda festinat et obruitur re.

- Vendere cum possis captivum occidere noli ;

Serviet utiliter: sine paseat durus aretque,

Naviget ac mediis hiemet mercator in undis;
Annonae prosit; portet frumenta penusque.

Foroellini adopts λαβεῖν as his solution.
Obbarius, on this passage, has collected all

the opinions mpecting the etymology of

64. In triviis fixum] Persius, speaking
of a man who was above sordid ways, says
(v. 110),· ‘Inque 1ιιιο fixum possis trans·
oendere nummumss where there' ιε a Scho-
linm which says boys used to fasten au as
ιο the pavement, and amuse themselves
with waoehing people stop to pick it ιιρ·
and Obbarius quotoe an old note on the
Prologueto Persius’ Satires (v. 6), relating
a similar amusement resorte'd to by old
men. whether this is referred vto by Ho-
race, or whether any such practice existed,
is doubtful. It is very likely Horace means
ιιο more than a man stooping to pick up an
as smm the mud, which seems to be the
origin of that expression of Augustine’s
(confess. v. 12), “lucrum luteum, quod
cum apprehenditur manum inquinat.”

65. qui cupiet metuet quoque ;] Horace
joins sear and desire in Epp. i. 2. 51 :

“ Qui cupit aut metuit juvat illum,’' διας
and ἰί. 2. 155 t

⁴⁸ At si divitiae prudentem reddere possent,
Si cupidum timidumque minus te, nempe

ruberes ——.''

67. Perdidit amm]

up in the love of it is a ρἱασπιςτ he has
oest away his arms, and run away from the
ranks of virtue. If you catch him, do not
put him to death, but sell him for a slave,
which is all he is fit for. He may do good
service in keeping cattle, or ploughing, οι·

going with his master, the mermtor, to sea,
replenishing the market, and so forth. One
of the principal sources from which the Ro-
mans got their slaves in earlier timoe was
the prisoners of war. Dealers always ac-
companied the camp for the purpose of pur-
chasing them. They were sold on the spot
by auction, ‘sub corona,’ that is with a
chaplet on their head ιο mark them for
sale. See Gellius (vii. 4) and Caesar (B. G.
iii. 16). Captives reserved to follow the
triumph of the commander were put to
death when the ion was over (see
Epod. vii. 8, n.). The law· writers derive
‘'servus from‘ servare,' as prisoners kept
for slavery were not put ιο death. ¹ An-
nona’ properly signifiae the year’s supply
of provisions from the harvest. ‘’Penus
signifies provisions of all sorts: “aet enim
omne, quo vescuntur homines, penus '' (Cic.
de Nat. Deor. ii. 27. 68). Here it means
all soi-ts of imported provisions, preservoe,
διο. ‘Penus ’ is of two declensions, the
second and third. The MSS. here are in
favour of ‘ penus’ (third), not ⁸ penum!

73. Vir bonus et sapiens] ‘The vir-
tuous and wise man can speak to Fortune
as Dionysus did to Pentheus! The scene
alluded to is that in Euripides play, Bac-
chae (489, sqq.):

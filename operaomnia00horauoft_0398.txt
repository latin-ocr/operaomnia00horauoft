Dixeris 5555 satis; neque si qui scribat uti nos
Sermoni propiora: putes hunc esse poetam.
Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior atque os

Esset quaesivere, quod acer spiritus ac vis
Nec verbis nec rebus inest, nisi quod pede certo

Differt sermoni sermo merus.

Cicero uses ⁴ praestaturus‚’ and Sall. (Jug.
47) ‘juvatm-us! Priscian (lib. ii.) quotes
⁴ sonatumm ' as irregular. Horace has
⁴ intonata ' in Epod. ii. 51. The attributes
of a poet Horace considers essential, are
genius, inspiration, and dignified senti-
ments, and language suited to high sub-
jects. See Virg. (G. iii. 294): ‘⁴ Nunc vene-
randa Pales, magno nunc ore sonandum?
Lambinus quotes from Petronius Arbiter
the following sensible remarks on this sub-
ject:—⁴‘Multos, inquit Eumolpus, juvenes
oermen decepit: nam ut quisque versum
pedibus instruxit, sensumque teneriore (te-
nuiore ?) verborum ambitu intexuit, putavit
se Heliconem venisse. Sic forensibus minis-
teriis exerciti frequenter ad carminis tran-
quillitatem tanquam ad portum faciliorem
confugerunt credentes facilius poema exstrui
posse quam controversiam umbrantibus
sententiolis pictam. Ceterum neque gene-
rosior spiritus sanitatem amat, neque conci-
pere aut edere partum mens potest nisi
ingenti flumine literarum inundante.’'

45. Idcirco quidam] In reference to
this certain persons have raised the question
whether a comedy was or was not a poem·

(see Key’.sL G. 1423). This 15 5 gram-
marian 's question, and depends upon the
definition assumed for a poem, in which
however imagination is generally supposed
to have a conspicuous place, and this would
exclude the comedies of Plautus and Terence,
and their Greek originals of thenew comedy‚
from the title of poen-y. But the samo
rule would exclude much more that lu·
passed for poetry, with 1555 pretension to
the name than Horace’s Satires or the
Heautontimorumenos. ⁴ Quidam’ significa

alsp referred to by Cicero in the extract
given in a late note (v. 38), “video visum

SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 3.

4⁷9.

Et Menelaum una mecum se occidere clamans.
Tu cum pro vitula statuis dulcem Aulide natam

Ante aras spargisque mola caput, improbe, salsa,

Rectum animi servas? Quorsum? Insanus quid enim Ajax
Fecit cum stravit ferro pecus! Abstinuit vim

Uxore et gnato; mala multa precatus Atridis,

⁴Non ille aut Teucrum aut ipsum violavit Ulixen.

Verum ego, ut haerentes adverso litore naves

Eriperem‚ prudens placavi sanguine divos.
Nempe tuo, furiose. Meo, sed 11011 furiosus.
Qui specioe alias veris scelerisque tumultu

duobus.” “Tu mini nummum potes uno
quaerere centum.”—‘ Morti dedit ’ is exactly
equivalent to our ‘put to death.¹ ‘Do'
means ‘to put3’ so its compounds ‘abd0,'
‘ toput away ;' ⁴ addo,’ ‘ to putto ς’ ‘ condo,’
‘to put together-3³ ‘’dedoss ‘to put down’
siz-zuzssbezfffm·aemam
‘to put on;' ‘eadm' ‘to put suess, to

200. spumisque mola eaput,] This is
the ‘mola 88138,ν the meal and salt with

(See C. iii. 23. 20, 11.)

201. Quonam: Imauus] Tbere are
different ways οἱ punctuating this passage.
Aaou 81111 Porphyrion have ⁴ quorsum in-
sanus ?' whidi the latter explains “quid
enim? inquit: inter quos insanus est, inter
luxuriosos et avaros, au inter ambitiosos ?''
Comm. Cruq. punctuates as 1 have done:
“Quorsum: supp. tendis3 quidvis? loqui-
tur mnon.'' So also Ven. 1483.
Orelli's three best MSS. go with the two
first Scholiasta. But ⁴ quorsum ?' expresses
a sudden 81111 angry interruption of the
king, astonished at the man’s boldness,
while he, being war-m, goes on without
heeding Agamemnon’s anger. So Ι under-
stand the passage. Heindorf and Bentley
have their own punctuation.

203. Uaeore et qnato ,·] Tecmaesa and
Eurysaces.

204, Non ine] ‘Non' must not be
separated trom ‘ ine! The meaning is ‘not
even he‚' οὐδ’ ἐκεῖνος. So in C. iii. 21. 1οε

“ Non ille qumquam Socraticis madet

sermonibus te negliget horridus.”

205. adverso litore] This Orelli, against

hisownfirst and 1 thinkbetterjudgm
interprets with Heindorf and others the
shore opposite to Troy. Ι think the shore
is called adverse because they wanted toget
away from it and could not. Properly the
winda were adverse, not the coast. But the
118ηεί01· of the epithet from the wind to the
shore is in accordance with a common
usage. Comm- Cruq. interprete ‘ adverso ¹
by “inimico, unde navigare 11011 poteram.”

ent,

207. Meo, ced musto-iosus] This is a
very polite reply, considering the provoca,
tion. The colloquy ends here. Horace,
1131111ιᾷογ presumssthad {omethingtobefore

w mus appear us a
rather unnatural and far-fetched scene.

208. Qui species alias ver-is] Of this
passage Bentley says it is “locus lubricus
quem nullus interpretum non attigit, nullus
dubium adhuc et incertum non reliquit.'’
Τ110 0111 editions and the majority of the
MSS. have ‘ver-i! The oldaet Blandinian
and three others quoted by Orelli have
¹ veris: which that editor adopts. It gives
a good sense, and Lambinus had taken it
into the text before he knew there was any
authority for it. ‘ Veri scelerisque tumultu
Permixtas ' is very intelligible. But ‘ alias ’
cannot stand alone. Bentley says it may
in the sense of ⁸ alienas 8 veritate,' ‘ foreign
to the 11·11111;’ or ‘alias atque ipse opinatus
est 3’ or, if not, he proposes to adopt
‘falsas' or ‘vanas‚' “levi mutatione‚” as
usual. He professes not to see what
‘ sceleris tumultus’ can mean, though he
could hardly require to be told that guilt
breeds confusion in the mind and is the
parent of error. Τ110 comment of Porph.
is ‘⁴ qui concipit animo species falsas et vera
non videt is demens aet‚” 81111 that seems to
me to be the meaning: he who entertains
fancies foreign to the truth, and confused
through the blinding power of his own
wickedness, is mad.

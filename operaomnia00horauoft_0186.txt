26. Flayitio additis Damnum .·] Franke
suggests that it may have been proposed
tc purchase the liberty of the prisoners.
Horace’s words are ‘ ye are adding mischief
to disgrace 3’ and from what follows it
would seem that the mischief would arise
from having among them again those who
had sunk so low. The words are like those
of Euripides (Rhes. 102),

αἰσχρὸν γὰρ ἡμῖν καὶ πρὸς αἰσχύνῃ

κακον.

30. repom· deterioribus] This has some-
times been translated as if Horace meant
that true virtue would not suffer itself to be
replaced by false, or virtue of a lower sort.
I rather think he means that true virtue,
when it has once been lost, does not care
to be restored to the degener-ate. So the
Scholiasts understood it. “ Excidit: sci-
licet animis. Curat reponi: i. e. restitui
ipsis animis deterioribus, i. e. minus bonis
quam prius.” (Porph.) Acron gives the
same explanation, and notioes the opposite
statement of Virgil (Aen. ii. 367) :—

“ Quondam etiam victis redit in praecordia
virtus.

Orelli adopts this interpretation.
33. Qui perfidia· se credidit hostibus,]

Bentley conjectures ‘dedidit’ destroying
the force of the words‘ he who has trusted

Ῐὲὶιιιξώἑὲο an enemy not to be trusted5’ as
. ni. . 25,—

“ Sic et Europe niveum doloso
Credidit tauro latus,”

where the oppositionis the same. Bentley's
usual method of arguing down a received
reading, by citing passages from otherwriters
where his own word occurs, is a mere waste
of labour. Any number of passages in
which ‘hostibus sese dedere' may com,
will not prove against all the MSS„ the
character of the sentence derived from the
epithet‘ perfidisss and the parallel passage
Ι have quoted, that Horace here wrotc‘ de-
didit, which sign ifies an unoonditioml sur-

37. Hic unde vitam] ‘He

coward), not considering to what e ought ⁴

to owe his life (i.e. to his own swerd, ‘um
salus victis,’ Aen. ii. 354), confonnds peace
withwar? that is to say, makespeacefor
himself on the field of battle. Bentley’s
mania for alteration leads him into a very·
great one here. In a few MSS. he finds
the reading ‘aptius' for‘ inscius, 'and this .
leads him to correct the whole pabsage thus,

timuitque mortem
Hinc, unde vitam sumeret aptium
Pacem et duello miscuit‚”

where the ‘hinc ' and ⁴ et‘ are his own in-
ventions, and the punctuation is also his own.

40. Altior Italiae ruinis l] On v. 62 of
the last ode was quoted from Ovid (Fast-
iii. 441) “ Pelion altior Ossa? ‘ Pelion
raised upon the head of Ossa-⁹ So here is
meant Carthago raised above the ruins of
Italy, and looking down upon them.

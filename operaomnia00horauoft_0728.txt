’ 698 HORATII FLAooi

(v. 153.) If you want your play to succeed you must study the characters ,of diffamia
ages: your child must be thoughtless and playfu1; your youth fond of mnnly sporta,
open to tempation, intolerant of advice, improvident, aspiring, and fickle3 your fuu-
grown man must be cautious, looking for money and friends and advancement3 while
your old man is surrounded with troubles, avaricious, nervous, cold, pmoemtinating,
slow of hope, sluggish, greedy of life, morose, quemlous, commending the former days,
a reprover of youth. For fear then of mixing up the different periods of life, wo thauld
fix attention upon the characteristics of each.

(v. 179.) The events must either pass upon the stage, or be told aster they are over.
What is seen makes more impression than what is heard ς but still horrore and ina-edi-
ble marvels are not to be mnsacted on the stage. A play should be in five acts. No
god should be brought in without necessity. No fourth person should be allowed to
speak. Τ11ε chorus should second the speakers, and should not sing what is irrelevant.
It should favour and counsel the good, calm the passionate, commend temperance,
justice, obedience to the laws, aud peace; keep sem-ets, and offer prayers ιο the gods
for mercy to the afflicted and vengeance ou the tyraut.

(v. 202.) Once the flute was a plain instrument made for the use of the chorus, md not
to fill great theatm, as now. But this simple music changed when conquest and
luxury mixed up country and town. Then the flate-playa sla-utted on the stege, and
the lyre was tuned to solemn sounds, to passionate eloquence, or στα-111111· strm'ns.

(v. 220.) 80011 after Tragedy oeme the Satyric Drama, when fun 111111 gravity were sepn-
rated, and the spectators in the licence of the hour were hosted with fresh juka und
novelties. But in those plays too there must be no inconsistendoe, sudi ns a god or
hero coming down to tavern-slang or losing himself in fustinn. Trngedy should mom
like a modest and stately matron among the Satyrs. For I would not bmish hogio -
language altogether, so that Silenus the god should talk in the same ιιι-11111 ns Dum the
slave. I would adopt a familiar style, so that any one should think he could do it as
well till he came to try. Fauns must neither talk like city beaux nor use low langnage,
lest they offend the better sort, though the vulgar may applaud.

(v. 251.) A short syllable and a long make an iambus, the rapidity of which made the
senarius pass for a trimeter. At first all( the feet were iambics, till to give more ste-di-
ness to the verse spondees were admitted in the uneven feet. Accius and Ennius mady
banished the iambic altogether. This is a blot in them, but it is not every one that mi
tell good versification from bad. Shall I presumo upon this? or shall Ι write nntiousu,
as if every fault would be detected? Thus might Ι escape blame, but should winnopru‘u.

(v. 268.) Take the Greeks for your models and study them.

Why, your fathers used to admire both the rhythm and the wit of Plautus.

Yes, stupidly enough, if we know the difference between coarseness aud wit, and mn soen ἱ 1

a verse.

(v. 276.) Thespis is said ιο have invented Tragedy, travelling about with his waggon, and
his actors smeared with wine lees. Then came Aeschylus with mask, robe, &thus-nus,
and stage, and taught them ιο speak grandly. After these the old comedy, which 'aa
highly approved, till licence was abused, and the law stepped in und eilmod flu
chorus. Our poets have been bold enough sometimes to quit the Greek md celebr-b
home tales in tragedy and comedy, and if they were more diligent latium mu heus
mighty in literature as in arms. Oh! my friends, have nothing to say to a poem
which does not show marks of care and correction.

(v. 295.) Because genius is above art, and all poets, according ιο Demea-iun, aro mad,
many let their nails and beard grow, affecting madness. Fool that I m ιο get rid
annually of my bile! 1 should otherwise be the first of poete. Novar mind, 1 will
serve as a grindstone for others, and teach them what a poet should he.

(v. 309.) Philosophy is the foundation of good writing. The books of Socrffl md his
disciples shall teach you the science and duties of life in au its relations, which he who

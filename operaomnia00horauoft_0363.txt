Ut metiretur nummos; ita sordidus ut se
Non uuquam servo melius vestiret ; adusque
Supremum tempus, ne se penuria vict-us

opprimeret metuebat.

At hunc liberta securi ’
Divisit medium, fortissima Tyndaridarum.

others, from the next satire, v. 12) is decided
by Bentley from inscriptions aud a pmsage
from Varro (de Re Rust. iii. 3), where one
of this name is mentioued, who Bentley
thinks may be Horaoe's Ummidius. He

mistakiug make Maenius a sordid fellow
aud Nomentanus a prodigal. They are

Maeuius aud Nomentanus are uamoe used
by Ludlius for chancters of the same kind,
aud Horace may very probably have only
borrowed the names to represent some living
characters whom he dooe not choose to point
out by their own names. Nomentanus
(whom the Scholiasta on this passage call
L. Cassius) was the name of oue of the
gueets at Nasidienus’ dinuer (S. ii. 8. 25),
audtheScholiasts tellusastoryofthehis-
toriau Sallust hiring his cook for au enor-
mous sum of money. Cruquius' Commen-
tator (ou the passage last quoted) says he
was a ‘dec-rimantis: one who farmed the
‘decumae,’ and therefore an ‘eques' (see
Cic.iuVerr. Achiil. 2. c.7l, audl. 3. ae,
Long’s notes). He appears again S. ii. 3.
224, sqq. Seneca (de ht be. c. ll) com·
paroe oue of this name with Apiuus.
Maenius the Scholiasts have confouuded
with him iu whose honour the Maeuia
columna was raised, C. Maenius, the con-
queror of the latins (Livy ,viii. 13). Some
of the old MSS. have Naevius for Maenius.
Cruquius aud Fea have that reading.

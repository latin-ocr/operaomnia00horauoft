the construction with the genitive see above

Kalends, which was a feast day. (Compare

1.1 tribus aut nonan Miscentur cyathis]
The ⁴ cyathus’ was a ladle with which the
drink was
thedrinkingcup. Theladlewasofceriain
capacity, and twelve ‘cyathi’ went to the
sextarius. Horace therefore says in effect,
“let the wine be mixed in the proportion
ofthreecyathios wine to nineofwater, or
of nine of wine to three of water.” He
says also the poet under the inspiration of
the Muses likae the stronger proportion3
but the Gracoe (in other words, good breed· λ
ing and good temper) forbid the wine to be
drunk pure, loet it lead to intoxication and
atrise. ‘Tres supra’ means the three over
the largest proportion of nine, and which,
if added, would make the drink ‘merum.’
1 need not set forth all the interpretations
that have been offered for this passage. ΤΙιο
above is Orelli’s, and seems to me to be the
fine one. He held a different opinion at
one time, and his Excursus may be oon-
sulted by those who are not satisfied with
the explanation here given. Tbere were
different ways of drinking healths. One

give, but I like it prest aster his own. lt
requires us to render‘ tres supra’ ‘above

means that such is theusualpractice, and

used. Verbs of all kinds signifying desire
and the reverse are frequently used with
the infinitive‚ as in this ode: ⁴⁴ demere sper-
nit‚’' ⁴⁴ refugit tendere ;” C. 9. 13, ⁴⁴ fuge
quaerere‚” &c. The student can now ob-
serve this usage for himself.

10. de Libycis verritur arcia] See C. iii.
16. 26, 31. S. ii. 3. 87; and Cic in Verr.
Act. ii. Lib. 3. c. 14, Long's note. The ⁴ area’
was a raised floor on which the corn was
threshed 3 and after the wind had winnowed
it the floor was swept, and the corn was
thus collected.

ll. findere sarculo] There is some-
thing of contempt in these words, where
we should have expected ⁴ amre? The soil
must be poor that was worked by a hoe,
and the owner ⁴ macro pauper agello.’ Fea
refers to Apuleius's description of Samos,
where “ruratio omnis in sarculo et surculo—
ager frumento piger, aratro irritus '' (F lorid
ii.). ⁴ Scindere ' is the proper word for the
plough ς * findere ' for the hoe or lesser in-
struments.—‘ Attalicis conditionibus ’ sig-

were three kings of Pergamus of this 1151118,
which was proverbial for wealth. Of the
second it is recorded, that be gave large
sums sor paintings and other works of art,
as much as 100 15181115 for 5 single picture,
(Plin. N. H. vii. 39). The third left his great
wealth to the Romans (11.8. 134). Some
suppose the peculiar habit of the former to
be alluded to. But it is enough that the
name had passed into a proverb, and chiefly
in connexion with the latter of these kings.
See C. ii. 18. 5. Compare sor ⁴ condi-
tionibus ' Cic. ad Qu. Fr. i. 2. 8 ι ‘⁴ Nulla
conditio pecuniae te ab summa integritate
deduxerit.”

13. dimoveas,] Orelli says the difference
between ⁴ dimoveo ' and ⁴ demoveo,’ which
some editions have, is that the formeris
used when a diversion into a new channel
is intended, the latter when no such 1118511-
ing is to be expressed. Dillenbr. reverses
this statement and reads ⁴ demoveas! The

meaning of the words must be derived from
themselves, not from their use3 for iu the
oonffiet of MSS„ not only 'here' but in

meaning of ⁴de,' ‘down from,' Ι should

properly used when the 111588 stom which ’

the removal takes place is expmsed, md
⁴ dimoveo ¹ when the sentence is absolute,
as 11818. For instance, ⁴ demovet' 1 11115-
gine to be the proper reading in C. iv. 5. 14:
⁴⁴ Curvo nec faciem littore demovet,'’ where
the MSS. have in many 1115155885 ⁴ dimo-
vet.’ Other examples will- be found by
which the render may judge for himself.

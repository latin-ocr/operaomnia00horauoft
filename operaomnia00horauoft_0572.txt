was a lamprey, and accounted a great deli-
cacy by the Romans, who appear to have
sometimes kept them tame. They were
brought chiefly from the coast of Sicily.
See Martial (xiii. 8o):—

Macrobius (Sat. ii. ll) and Pliny (ix. 55)
relate, the one of L. Crassus and the other
of Hortensius the orator, that they each
kept a pet ‘ muraena,' and each shed tears
when their favour-ite died. See Mart. (x.

‘⁴ Natat ad magistrum delicata muraena.
Nomenculator mugilem citat notum,
Et adesse jussi prodeunt senes mulli.”

The prawns were swimming in sance, the
composition of which the host goes on to
describe himself, as a matter of too much
consequence to be left to the explanation of
his nomenclator. The materials were Vena-
frian olive oil (C. ii. 6. 16, n.), ‘ garum' (a
sauce made of the entrails and blood ‘of
fish, and here made from the scomber,
perhaps the mackerel, caught in greatest
abundance off the coast of Spain. See
Pliny (xxxi. 8), ‘⁸ Garum ex scombro pisce
laudatissimum in Carthagenis spartariae
cetariis;’' and Martial (xiii. 102) :—

“ Exspirantis adhuc scombri de sanguine
Accipefi'alencbosum, munera cara, gamm,”
some Italian wine added while it was

making, and some Chian when it was
made3 white pepper (see above, 4. 74, n.)

and vinegar made from sour Lesbim wine
(C. i. 17. 21). Of the other ingredients
Nasidienus boasts of having invented two

the rocket, a vegetable of the genus bras-
sica, and the ⁴ inula campanal ‘eleoem-
paue,' the ‘inula helenium ' (ὲλένιον) of
Linnaeus, a plant that grows in meadows
and damp ground. It is used medici-any u

a bitter. The last ingr-edient was the

⁴ echinus,’ a prickly shell-fish, thrown in ’

without being washed, for the benefit of its
saline qualities; for which addition to the
sance he gives credit to one Curtillus,
whoever he may have been. The superi-
ority of the ‘ echinus' to ‘muria' (see¹
S. ii. 4. 65, n.) is here said to consist in
the fact of the former coming fresh from the
sea, and furnishing a more perfect brine.

CARMINUM III. 3. 145

In pulverem, ex quo destituit deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon, mihi
Oastaeque damnatum Minervae
Cum populo et duce fraudulento.
Jam nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae 25

Perjura pugnaces Achivos

Bellum resedit. Protinus et graves 30
Iras et invisum nepotem
Troica quem peperit sacerdos
Marti redonabo; illum ego lucidas
Inire sedes, ducere nectaris
Succos, et adscribi quietis 35
Ordinibus patiar deorum.
Dum longus inter saeviat Ilion
Romamque pontus qualibet exsules
In parte regnanto beati ;
Dum Priami Paridisque busto 40

ever. Oinara‘ seems to represent a red person3 and with Canidia

'rho same remark applies in some measure to other Odes addressed
nominnlly to friends, but which might 88 easily be addresscd to 0110
friend ns to another. The difference is that the names are in most

I have expressed my opinion of Horace as a Satirical writer invarious
places. On this point the reader may refer to the remarks in the

ι Introduction to the ninth Satire of the first book. Of common sense

and a perception of the ridiculous; of that knowledge of mankind which
is gathered by mixing with the world; of dramatic skill; of good na-

: tm'o and good breeding, Horace has shown sufficient 111-0018, both in

the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic he is certainly defective.
Homer he does not appear to have understood. Plautus and Terence
110 0011111 not appreciate, and the mex-its of Lucilius (and he must have
11811 merite) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of 811 indolent habit, of which the unfinished state of some ἢ

— of his poems is 0110 of the effects. “ Amphora coepit Institui3 currente
“’ mia. cm· urceus exit Ρ ” 18 8 question that might 110 applied, Ι think, to
ἵ v more than one of his Satires and Epistles- There is more inequality in
these than in the Odes ; more also that is common-place in thought 81111

diction. The Odes will bear better than the Satires and Epistles the
close inspection that an editor is obliged to give them. Any one who
undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his principal
difficulties consists in the examination, first separately and then 0011οα
tively, of so many small pictures as the Odes present. The tendency of

η·- oommentators to far-fetched conjectures as to their scope, allusions,
⁵³, date, doc„ is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.

 

Their beauties and merits appear to me to be of a quiet kind, and
. the happy selection of words is one of them. Horace's selection of
Α epitheta is judicious and forcible. “Mirus ac paene divinus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis. The terseness and good sense ‘of the

the manner in which they are introduced, being always-⁶ 111 their place
' and never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might

easily appear. Herein, more than in any other respect, Horace suc-

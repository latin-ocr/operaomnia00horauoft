HORATII FLAGOI

Ante Larem gustet venerabilior Lare dives3

Qui quamvis perjurus erit, sine gente, eruentus

Sanguine fraterno, fugitivus, ne tamen illi
Tu comes exterior si postulet ire recuses.'''
‘⁴ Utne tegam spurco Damae latus ἓ· Haud ita Trojae

Me gessi certans semper melioribus.”
Pauper eris.'' ‘⁴ Fortem hoc animum tolerare jubebo ;

cate bird. ⁴ Privum' means for your own
private eating.

14. Ante Larem] Τ118 first-fruits were
offered to the Lares, as represented on a
gem in Gorlaeus' collection, P. i. No. 190,
in which is a naked figure standing by an
altar with a basket of fruit in his right hand
and two ears of corn in his left. See Tibull.
i. l. 13 :—

⁴⁴ Et quodcunque mihi pomum novus edu-
cat annus

Libatum agricolae ponitur ante deo.'’

No divinity was dearer to a Roman than his
Lares, whose images stood in his hall, who
reminded him of his departed ancestors, and
whom he invoked and sacrificed to every
day at his meals (see C. iv. 5. 34. On the
worship of the Lares, full information will
be found 111 Smith’s Dict. Myth.).

15. sine qente‚] Suppose him to be a
⁴ libertinus,’ and 111 former days to have run
away from his master, in which case he
would be 111-81111811 011 the forehead, and the
shame of attending him would 118 greater.
He would also be ⁴ sine gente‚' that is, he
would belong to no ⁴ gens,' if he were the
descendant of a freedman, or had suffered
⁴ capitis diminutio,' if the definition of ⁴ gen-
tilis’ by Scaevola given by Cicero (Top. vi.)
is correct (see Dict. Ant. art. ⁴ Gens,'
448, α). Horace means one of low birth,
or who has been disgraced. The legal de-
finition goes further, since ⁴ capitis diminu-
tio ’ might be incurred without disgrace,
and the exclusion on the score of slavery
extended to ancestors of the remotest de-
gree.

17. Tu comes eoeterior] Teii-osias ad-
vises that, if the rich man should call upon
him to attend him when he walks abroad, he
should never refuse to go, taking the least
honourable place, which was by his patron’s
side, and usually between him and the road.
The Scholiast's explanation, ‘⁴ Exterior .-
sinisterior, in sinistra parte positus,'’ is not
sufficient z the business of the humble com-
panion was to give his patron the wall and
to walk outside, ⁴⁴ sive dexter sit sive sinis-

‘⁴ Ergo
20

ter,’' as Forcellini says (s. v. ‘interior ’).
The expressions ⁴ tegere latus? ‘claudere

,latusss were common enough, 81111 meant

plainly to take that side which 'was most

exposed. See Juvenal (111. 131) :—

⁴⁴ &illitis hic servi claudit latus ingenuorum

where ⁴ servi ' means, as here, 0118 who had

been a slave. Martial calls the companion

⁴ latus,’ but the expression was probably

peculiar to himself (vi. 68) :—

⁴⁴ Inter Baianas raptus puer occidit undas
Entylciltilss'”ffle tuum, 08811188, dulce

Ovid, speaking of the respect shown to a

senator of the olden time 011 account of his

age, says (Fast. v. 67),—

⁴⁴ Et medius juvenum, non indignantibus
ipsu-1,

Ibat, et interior si 8011185 1111115 erat.'’
Suetonius, speaking of the condescensioni of
Claudius (8. 24), says, ⁴⁴ Aulo Plautio etiam
ovationem decrevit (on account of *his suc-
cesses in Britain), ingressoque urbem ob-
viam progressus, et. in Capitolium eunti et
inde rursus revertenti latus texit.” And
Eutropius, repeating the same anecdota,
says, ⁴⁴ conscendenti Capitolium laevus 111-

 

p. cederet;'' from which it would seem as if

the less honourable place was called eon-
ventionally ⁴ laevus,' though the outside
must as osten be right as lefl: (see Epp. i.
6. 50, 8.). Torrentius has a long note 011
the subject. ⁴ Utne tegam ⁹ is a short way
of saying ⁴ hortarisne me ut tegam?
‘Damae' is used generally as a common
name of slaves (see S. i. 6. 38). ⁴ Spurcus’
is a word Lucilius used, as in that verse
quoted by cicero (Tusc. ii. 17), ‘⁴ Ergo hoc
poterit ⁴ Samnis spurcus homo vita illa dig-
nus locoque ?'''

20. hoc] When Teiresias tells him he
must be content to be poor, or do as he
bids him, Ulysses consents to the degra-
dation rather than incur the poverty, and
makes a merit of doing so: he will bear the
disgraoe with his usual magnanimity. Some

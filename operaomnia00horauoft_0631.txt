Non qui Sidonio contendere callidus ostro
Nescit Aquinatem potantia vellera fucum
Gertius accipiet damnum propiusque medullis,
Quam qui non poterit vero distinguere falsum.

the ‘mala fastidia? which nature, silently
recovering her ground, contrives to sup-

barius calls‘ difficillimus locus' can have
but one meaning. ‘ Not he who knows not
skilfully to compare with Sidonian purple

jectswithwhich the mind is employed in
what' rs called fashionable life to the de-

The MSS. vary between‘ propiusve' and
‘propiusque' There 1s not much to choose
between them, but 1 prefer* que!

The‘ murex ’‘and purpura,' which were
the ahell-fish from which the purple dye
was obtained, abouuded on the coasts of
Italy. Those of Baiae were most cele-
brated on thewoet coast (S. ii. 4. 32, ιι.),
and those ofTarentum on the east (Epp. ii.
1. 207). The foreign purploe (enumerated
ou C. ii. 16. 36) were most esteemed, and
these were imitated by the Italians. The
jnices varied in colom-(n various places ac-
cording to climate and local circumstances.
Thac part of the fish which yielded the dye
was extr-acted (see S. ii. 4. 32, ιι.) and
strewed with salt in the proportion of 20
ouncae to 100 pouuds of fish. This caused
flie juice to flow, and kept it from putrefac-
tion. Aster remaining thus for three days
the juice was drawn off into a leadexr caul-
dron, the heating of which gave the colours
additional brilliancy. Aster ten days of this
process, by which the floehy particloe were
carried off, the liquor was fit for use. The
wool was steeped for five hours, and then

driedandcarded;andthiswasrepeatedtill
the dyc was sufficiently imbibed according
tothe qnalityrequired. The‘fucus’wasa
marine plant of some kind which yielded a
red juice used for colouring. Pliny (xxvi.
10) says that wool was sometimes stained
with this before it was steeped in the pur-
ple. But it was commonly used in imitation
of the real dye. Hence it came to be used
for d ‘on in (see Forcellini).
Aquinum (Aquino), the birth-place of
Juvenal, ω a large town of latium on
the Via Latina, between Fregellae and
Venafrum. We hear no where else of its
carrying ou a trade in dyed articles; and
Comm. Cruq., who says that it did so, seems
only to have got his information from this
passage. Τ1ιο town of Amyclae, on the
Latin coast, seems to have dealt in the
same imitation wools which Ovid mentions
(Rem. Am. 707) :—

“Confer Amyclaeis medicatum vellus ahenis
Murice cum Tyrio, turpius illud erit,”
which Quintilian quotoe (xii. 10. 75). say-
ing, “Ut lana tincta fuco citra purpuras
placet, at si contuleris Tyriae lacernae cou-
melioris obruatur.’'

31. Si quid mirabere] This maxim is
consistent with the advice to Numicius,
34. Cervus equum pugna melior] Stesi-
chorus' is said to have spoken this fable to
the citizens of Himera when they were pre-
paring to confer absolute power on Phalaris,
and give him a body ‚ as mentioned
by Aristotle (Rhet. ii. 20). The sable' is told
by Phaedrus (iv. 4), with the substitution
of a boar for the stag. Bentley (Epist. of
Phalaris, p. 27) rather doubts the accuracy
of Aristotle in connecting the story with
Phalaris. Conon, a grammarian of Augus-
tus' time, and the author of a work mlled
Διηγῂσεις, consisting of fisty narratives,

6 HORATII FLAGOI

Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium

Dis miscent superis; me gelidum nemus

Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori
Secernunt populo, si neque tibias
Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia
Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.

Quod si me lyricis vatibus inseris, ’

Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.

28. teretes] This word Festus describes
to mean ‘long and round as a pole‚’ which
definition wiu not always be found to help
us to its meaning. It has always more or
less closely the meaning of roundness or
smoothness, or both as g.here It contains
the same rootas‘ terol ‘sswrnus τεὶρω, and
its cognate words, and its meaning is got
from the notion of rubbing and polishing.
Horace applies it to a woman' s ancles, a
smooth-faced boy, the cords of a net, and a
faultless man (see Index). It is applied by
Ovid (Fast. ii. 320) to a girdle, and by Virgil
(Aen. xi. 579) to the thong of a sling ς where,
as here, it represents the exact twisting of a
cord. ⁴ Slender’ will not do ς for ‘ plagae'
were nets of thick cord with which the
woods were surrounded, to catch the larger
beasts as they were driven out by dogs and
beaters. The professed translator-s, as
usual, give no assistance. Smart renders
the words, ‘⁸ circling toils ;” Francis, ‘⁴ spread-
ing toils;'’ Dacier omits“ teretes’ altoge-
ther. Marsus for Marsicae, as Colchus for
Colchicus, Medus for Medicus, and many
others, is the only form Horace uses.

29. Me doctarum hederae praemia fron
tium]—‘ Te’ has been proposed for ‘ me3'
and Mr. Tate has declared, that this ‘⁴ true
reading, on necessity arising from internal
evidence against ⁸ me ' and the MSS.‚ after
the assent of scholars generally given, may
now take its place as it were by acclamation.”
Orelli says, in opposition to Mr. Tate, “ con-
jecturam—jam ab omnibus explosam esse
arbitror.'’ It was originally conjectured by
Hare, and the only editors as far as I
know, who had adopted it when Mr. Tate

wrote, are Jones and Sanadon. Other
critics have defended it, but very lamely
and more recently Fea has adopted this²
reading, but on grounds very different from
his predecessore. “,Thou Maecenas,'’ he
{az} tiffvffiffiffi ffiffim
to the gods in their conge-'¹ 1 need not
proh-act this note with quotations to prove
that the ivy, which was named to Bacchus,
made a⁴ fit and usual garland for a lyric
poet. “Doctarum flentium, '' which Mr-
Tate defends, as applied to Maecenas, is
the proper description of poeta, who, by
the Greeks were mlled σοφοὶ. Sodoaeol
managai& 1333& The lyra of
Sap pho and Alcaeus.

35. Quod η’] A reference to the Index
will show that‘ quod si 'does not occur, as
Orelli says it does, but rarely‘ ιιι the poem.
The MSS. vary b’etweeu‘ inseris ’‘and in-
seres! ΤΙιθ present seems to be more in
keeping with whatgoes before, and Horace
had no occasion tom express a doubt aa to
whether Maecenas ranked him among lyrae
poets.A1th0ugh the personalp ronoun ‘ta'
is emphatic m this sentence, rtis omitted,
the poets osten do, where no opposition of
persons is intended. Orelli and Dinenbr.
have quoted a fragment of Sappho (16
Bergk), from which it might appear that
the last line was imitated: but the read-
ing is so doubtful that nothing certain ean
be made out of it. The idea will be found

frequently ιιι Ovid.—‘ Lyricis' is less com-

vmon than‘ melicis,y to describe the lyric

poete of Greeoe.

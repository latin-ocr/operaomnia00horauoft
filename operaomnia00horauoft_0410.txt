HORATII FLAOGI

Cocceius Capitoque simul Fonteius, ad unguem
Factus homo, Antoni non ut ma'gis alter amicus.
Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore libenter

32. Capitoque simul Fonteium]
much is known of C. Fonteius Capito. He
was deputed by Augustus on this occasion,
as being a particular friend of M. Antonius,
who afterwards, as Plutarch relates (Anton.
36) sent him, while he was in Syria, to fetch
Cleopatra thither from Egypt. When Au-
gustus laid down the consulship in A.u.c.
721, Capito was appointed Consul Suffectus.

‘He had a son who was consul with Ger-
manicus A.u.c. 765, with whom Heindorf
confounds Antonius’ friend in the text.
Orelli mentions a coin of this Capito with
the following inscription :—“ c. ronrmvs.
cAPrro. rao. ra. Ξ M. ANT. ιΜΡ. cos.
nasm. maa. ET. TERT. 111. vm. a. P. c.'’
The expression ‘ adunguem factus ¹ is taken
from the craft of the sculptor, who tries the
surface of his statue by passing the nail
over it: if the parts be put perfectly. to—
gether, and the whole work well finished,
the nail passes over the surface, and meets
with no obstruction. “Translatio sumpta
a marmorariis qui unguibus juncturas et
levitatem explorant” (Comm. Cruq.). See
Persius, S. i. 64 :—
“ — oermina molli

Nunc demum numero fluere, ut per leve

severos
Effundat junctura ungues.”

Compare also A. P. 294: “Perfectum decies
non castigavit ad unguem! 'Plutarch copies
the expression (Symph. vi. 4), ἡ ἀκριβὴς
σφόδρα καὶ δι’ ὄνυχος λεγομένη δίαιτα.
Below (S. ii. 7. 86) the perfect man is
described as—

“ —- in se ipso totus, teres atque
rotundus,
Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari,”

which is like the description of the text, ’

though the metaphor is not quite the same.
‘ Non ut magis alter ’ is equivalent to ‘ quam
qui maxime ’ in prose.

34. Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore]
They arrived at Tarracina about noon, and
there the principal personages met them.
At Tarracina they slept, and proceeded
next morning to Fundi (Fundi), sixteen
miles further to the north-east of Tarracina.
Fundi was situated on the north shore of a
lake, which was called after it Fundanus·
and also Amyclanus, from an old Greek
town Amyclae, the existence of which was
only traditional when Horace wrote, but is

Not ·

occasionale mentioned by the poets. Mar-
tial (xiii. 115) associates it with Fundi and
the Caecuban vineyards, which were in this
neighbourhood :—

“ Caecuba Eundanis generosa coquuntur
Vissffieytciiis’media nata palude viret.¹’

Fundi was one of that class of towns called
⁴ praefectura,' which, instead of having the
administration of its own affairs, was go-
verned by a ‘ praefectus’ sent annually from
Rome by the Praetor Urbanus (see Smith’s
Dict. Ant. art. ‘ Colonia ’). At this time
the ‘ praefectus' was one Aufidius Luscus
(not otherwise known), an upstart whom
Horace calls Praetor by way of ridicule.
The officers of the other municipal towns
were allowed to wear the‘ toga praetexta,'
the ‘toga’ with 8 purple berder (Livy
xxxiv. 7), but the‘ praefecti’ were not, and
yet Luscus wore them. The‘ latus clavus,'
tyhe broad purple stripe down the front of
the ‘tunicss was a badg e that belonged
only to senators. ‘ Prunae batillum ' was a
pan of hot coals ¹⁴ in quo ponuntur prunae
in hieme super mensam ne coena frigeat ”
(Comm. Cruq.). This Scholiast spells tho
word ‘ vatillum,’ and says it is 8 diminutive
of‘ vas. ’ “Vas parvum, in quo pro felici
hospitum adventu incensis odoribus Jovi
hospitali sacra fiebant. quod cum ex cupro
esset ita tollebat et ostentabat hospitibus
quasi esset aureum, et ob hanc causamvoca-
tur ab Horatio insanus.” A good deal in
this explanation is without valna, >and the
etymology is clearly wrong3 but the pan of
coals may have been used, as this Scholiast
says. for burning incense or otherwise in
connexion with sacrifice. Aufidius, it ap-
pears, had been a ‘scriba’ or clerk, probably
in the ‘'praetor s 'office, such a situation as
Horace held at this time in the⁴ quaestui-¹⁸.-
Persons m that capacity had opportunifies
of pushing their fortunes if they managed
well, and the honours of Luscus are spoken
of as ⁶ praemia,' rewards of service rendered
to his master. Livy (xxiii. 19) mentions
that one M. Anicius, praetor (as the prin·
cipal officers in 8 few of the chief muni-
cipia seem to have been called, probably by
courtesy) of Praeneste, had formerly been
a ‘scriba. ’ Fun information on the tems
scribass ‘toga praetexta,’ and‘ latus clnvusJ
will be found ιιι Smith’ s Dict. Ant.

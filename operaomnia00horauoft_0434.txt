he goes to bed without the nervous feeling
that he must be up early to go to the

So that, when Servius describes the statue
in the Forum, (to which Martial alludes in
the sixty-fourth Epigram of the second

Forum, where a statue of Marsyas (the book,

unfortunate rival of Apollo) was erected
near the Rostra. Servius (on Aen. iv. 58,
‘¹ Legiferae Cereri Phoeboque patrique
Lyaeo '’) says that Lyaeus was properly
looked upon as the defendet of liberty in
cities, aud that for this reason the statue of
Marsyas his servant was set up in the Fo-
rum, with his arm lifted up, as a sign of the
freedom and wealth of the city in which
he is. According to Savigny (Vermischte
Schriften, i. 40), Marsyas or Silenus was the
symbol of a city having the Jus Italicum,
one part of which was a free constitution of
its own. It would therefore appear in the
Forum as the symbol of free jurisdiction.
Τ118 only representations of Marsyas that
remain exhibit him either in the agony of

the Grand Duke’s palace at Florenoe, sus-
pended to a tree, with his arms fastened
over his head, and his feet scarcely able
to touch the ground, while his face shows
great pain: and there is a ge'm in the
Massimi collection at Rome (Agostini
Gemme Ant. p. ii. pl. 9), in which he is
represented as tied to a tree, expecting the
knife, which Apollo (said to be meant for
Nero, who, Suetonius says, liked to be
represented in the statues of the gods and
heroes, and particularly under the person of
Apollo, sor he affected much skill in music)
is handing to a slave. The same scene is
represented a little differently in the collec-
tion of Gorlaeus (i. 111), where the poor
wretch has lost his skin, and is writhing in
agony, while the slave is returning the
knife to Apollo. On the other side of this
gem, which is engraved on both sides, are
the heads of Nero and Poppaea. Gronovius
considers this to be the true gem, and the
other a clumsy copy. But however this
may be, “a Marsyas countenance'' was
synonymous with dejectiori and ill humour.
Thus Juvenal addresses Naevolus (S. ix. l):

“ Scire· velim quare toties mihi, Naevole,
Οοὲιῗιιιῗτῖξ „fronte obducta, ceu Marsya
victus.

“ fora litibus omnia fervenu
Ipse potest fieri Marsya causidicns,”)

with his arm raised, it is probably a sign of
extreme suffering and Horace seems to
indicate that his face was distorted. and
ascribes it humoronsly to his detestation οῖ
the younger Novius, whom also, as Comm-
Cruq. says, he may mean to represent him
as threatening with his upnmd arm. who
this younger Novius was we oennot tell.
The Scholiasts say he was an υκαι-αι’, and
intimate that he was of a family of usnrers.
“ Marsyam alteram habere manum erectam
ad depellendos Novios, quod eorum foenera-
torum impudentiam non posset sustinere '⁹
(Comm. Cruq.). Estre supposes him to be

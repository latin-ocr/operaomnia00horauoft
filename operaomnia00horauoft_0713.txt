Nemo hoc mangonum faceret tibi ; non ¹temere a me
Quivis ferret idem. Semel hic cessavit et, ut fit,

In scalis latuit metuens pendentis habenae.

Ille ferat pretium poenae securus, opinor;
Prudens emisti vitiosum ; dicta tibi est lex:
Insequeris tamen hunc et lite moraris iniqua?

Dixi me pigrum proficiscenti tibi, dixi

Talibus officiis prope mancum, ne mea saevus

J urgares ad te quod epistola nulla rediret.

Quid tum profeci mecum facientia jura

Si tamen attentas? Quereris super hoc etiam, quod

14. Semel hie emovit] He once was
behind histime,and hid himself undeaeor
on the staircase sor sear of a flogging.
‘’comtor and‘ erro' were synonymous
words. (Se08.ii.7.loo.113,m)'1'he
mire may have been dark sometimes, and,
aa in most houses the principal accommo-
dationwas ou the ground floor, it is pro-
bable that so much regardwasnothadto

Cicero, speakingofClodius (proMil. c.

up in some conspicuous place in terrorem.

Comm. Cruq. says it hung in the middle of
the house, and that slaves were tied to the
stairs to be flogged.

16. Det ammom] This line Orelli gives
to Horace. Ῑ think it is the conclusion οἱ
the dealer's speech, but this is doubtful.

17. poenae εει-τιναῆ] Among the faults
thesellerofa slavewas bound to tellwas

running away. (See pmges from Cicero ,

and the Digaet quoted on S. ii. 3. 285.)

21. ne mea saevus Juryaroe] ‘Mea’
belongs to ⁴ epistola,' and is a long way out
of its place. ‘ J urgo,’ which Varro derives
from ‘jure ago‚’ is used as a forensic word
by the law writers. It is intransitive. (See
Forcell.) The reading of the bost MSS.
and the editions of the fifteenth century is
¹ rediret! Later editions, including Bentley,
have ‘ veniret: which also hm MS.v au-
thority. Orelli, Dillenburger, Putea, and
some others of the latoet editors, have gone
back to the old reading. It is not easy to
understand how ⁴ rediret’ should have got
into such MSS. as the four Blandinian, the
Berne, and Parisian, if ‘veniret' were the
true reading. Nearly all Torrentius' MSS.
had ‘rediret,' and he appi-oves, but does
not edit, that reading. His text and his
notes are constantly at vax-ianoe, and on thia
account he is osten quoted as an authority
for he does not appi-ove. As his
judgment was good, this‘ is to be regmae-i.
In this instance it is not easy to say which
is the right word, but 1 prefer following the
better order of MSS. Florus had written
probably more than once, expostulating
withhimonhissilence, andhadgotno
answer.

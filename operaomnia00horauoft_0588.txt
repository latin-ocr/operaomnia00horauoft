558 HORATII FLACOI

EPISTLE II.

Something has been said about M. Lollius, the consul, who was defeated by the
Sigambri, in the Introduction to C. iv. 9, which ode was addressed to him probably on
the occasion of his defeat, some time after the writing of this Epistle to his eldest
son, as the person here addressed is very generally supposed to be. The eighteenth
Epistle is written tc the same person. There we leam that Lollius was with Au-
gustus in the Cantabrian expedition, A.u.c. 729, and that he had a brother, to whom ι
some suppose the eighteenth Epistle was written. It is plain that the person here ad-
dressed was young, and if he had been with the army he was now practising for the
Forum. Horace addresses him as ‘ puer,’ and speaks of his declaiming as if he were still
with the rhetorical teacher, which he was no doubt3 but these teachers attended young
men at home after they had left school and taught them the higher principles of oratory.
‘ Puer ' is a word that might be used familiarly towards a young man long past ‘ pum-itia:
and, as Franke observes, it is not likely that these grave views of life would be eamd
to a boy who had not yet taken the ‘ toga virilis! Ι think there is much probability in
the date Franke supposes, A.u.c. 731, which would be a year aster Lollius' return from
Spain while he might yet be quite young: though when Franke supporta his opinion by
the reference in v. 53 to gout and fomentations, he only weakens his argument (see note).
Why Lollius is called Maximus in the first verse no one has yet satisfactorily shown.
That he was the elder of two brotherS, supposing that to have been the case, would be
a bad reason for calling him Maximus. He would rather be called Major. But this is
the opinion of most editors, and of Orelli among them. That he had the cognomen
Maximus is the explanation of others. But there is no trace of such a cognomen in this
family: the only cognomen they are known to have borne during the republic is Palicanus,
and the father of this youth does not appear to have had any. Young Lollius could not
have done any thing to gain himself such a title; and on the whole I am inclined to think
the word is only a familiar half jocular way of addressing his young friend that Horace
uses, as in the other Epistle he addi-esses him as ⁴ liberrime Lolli! 1 see no other wayof
explaining the word, which Estr6 gives up as unintelligible.

Horace has been refreshing himself with the cool breezes of Praeneste, and reading
Homer over again, and has been more than ever impressed, as it would seem, with the
wisdom of his poems and the moral and political Iessons they convey. This he makes
the foundation of a letter of advice, such as a young man just starting in life might find
useful. What appears to have struck him most on his last perusal of the Iliad was the
reckless seltishness of the leaders and their indifference to the sufferings their petty
squabbles occasioned; while the Odyssey he judges to have been written with the in-
tention of representing a picture of patient and wise endurance in the person of Ulysses,
as an example to all ages. Horace considers the value of the Homeric poems to lie in
the living pictures they present to the mind; that they taught wisdom by examples. He
says nothing of the poetry and the artistic character of these compositions, in which their
real merit consists. As a piece of criticism therefore Horace’s remarks are worth no-
thing. They are akin to the allegorical interpretation of Homer which treated his works
as an inexhaustible fountain of wisdom, and overlaid the critical with a fanciful view.
That a sensible man might get some good lessons from the Iliad and Odyssey is saying
no more than may be said of any works in which character is drawn in so many various
shapes. But that the predominating impression on the mind of a man like Horace, with

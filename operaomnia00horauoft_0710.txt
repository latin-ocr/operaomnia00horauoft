680 HORATII FLACOI

Armenia. He might certainly even at that time have been called his ⁴ fidelis amicus ς’ but
the words seem to imply a longer and more matured friendship ; and the epithet ‘clarum'
which would have been mere flattery when Tiberius was twenty-two and had done nothing,
would suit him very well after his successes against the Raeti celebrated in C. iv. 14. In
A.u.c. 743, Tiberius was sent by Augustus against the Dalmatians and Pannonians, and
was absent from Rome four years, with the exception of a short interval, when hc brought
home the remains of his brother Drusus, A.u.c. 745. (Dion Cass. 54. 313 55. 2.)
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 39) thinks that Florus accompanied him, and that this Epistle
was written the year of their departure, and published the next year, when he supposes
the letter to Augustus was written. This may be true, but Tiberius went with Augustus
to Gaul A.u.c. 738, and Florus may have been with him then. The objection to that
date is that Horace did certainly write verses about that fime, of the kind Florus asked
foi-3 and though this is not conclusive, for he wrote with no great love for the task, on
the whole I think a later date is more probable.

Though there does not profess to be much substance in the Epistle, 1 think it the most
agreeable of all. The stories in illustration are very well told3 the desa-iption of the
town and its annoyances has the force without the harshness of Juvena13 the vanity of
authors is ridiculed in a happy and humorous way, and the advice given them is goodg
and though as usual the sermon at the end about money and philosophyis perhaps a little
tedicus, and not very convincing, as a whole the Epistle is written in a popular style, and
the language and versification are easy and correct. It is always pleasant likewise to hear
Horace speaking of himself, the events of his life, and the peculim-inea of his charam.
This Epistle furnishes materials for a considerable part of his biography, and makes iss
acquainted with his poetical career in particular. It represents him as writing more stom

necessity than out of love to poetry, and it would not be difficult to traco the force of a

pressure from without in many parts of his works.

ARGUMENT.

(v. l.) Florus, if any one were to offer you a slave for sale, and say, ‘ Here is a handsome
accomplished boy, you shall have him cheap: 1 have no wish to puff my property, and

am not obliged to part with him3 but I assure you you will find him a bargaintno ’-

dealer would give him you for the money, and there is no one but yourselfI would
give him to so cheep: but Ι must tell you he once shirked duty (as boys will), and
hid himself in the staircase,'——if you bought thetboy you would do so with your eyes
open and at your own risk. You could not prosecute the man if your slave ran away

&⁸333- When you were going away 1 told you 1 was too lazy ω answer your letters ·

when you should write. What was the use of my doing so if now you are to reproaeh ᾗ

me as ifI had broken my word?
(v. 26.) An officer of Lucullus' one night while he was asleep had all his money and equip- η
ments stolen. He became furious in consequence with himself as well as the enemy,

and while his blood was up stormed and took one of the king's strongest plaoes full οἲ ζ
treasure, for whichlhe was promoted and rewarded. About the same time the general γ

wanted to get possession of a certain forti-ess, and calling the officer he says to him,
‘ Go, my brave friend, go where thy valour calls thee, and great shall be thy :ew-td! -
‘ Nay,’ replies the cunning man, ‘ send some one who has lost his purse!
(v. 41.) It was my lot to begin my education at Rome, and to finish it at Athens. hom · ¹
thence 1 was hurried off to the disastrous wars, and when Ι got my discharge at Philippi,

with my wings cropped, shorn of my inheritance, I was driven by my poverty to write·
verses. But now that 1 have enough, 1 should be mad past recoveryif 1 did not ’

count my ease better than scribbling. Time is stealing every thing from m'Q—mirffir

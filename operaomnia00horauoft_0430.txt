of the old editions, and the received reading
in Bentley’s time was ‘si quis) But the
Blandinian and other old MSS. have ‘si
qui‚’ which occurs above, v. 30.

86. praeco—coactor] The first of these
functionaries was a crier either at auctions
(one of his duties being to induce persons
to attend and buy—see A. P. 419, “ Ut
praeeo ad merces turbam qui cogit emen-
das ’'), or in courts of justice, or the public
assemblies. There was a ‘praeco’ at all
punishments and executions to declare the
crime of the offender (Epod. iv. l2, n.); also
town-criers,who cried lost property, as with
us. There were other kinds of criers, re-
counted in Dict. Ant. Which class Horace
refers to we cannot tell. Nor is it decided
what class of ⁴ coactores' his father be-
longed to. There were persons employed
by the ⁴ publicani' to collect the revenue,
81111 who were called ‘ coactores! The per-
son who collected the money bid at an auc-
tion was also a ‘ coactor,' and generally
persons employed to collect money bore
that title. It is probable that the ‘coactores'
of the first class made a good deal of money.
Matthew the Apostle was one, and he was
rich. It is generally believed that the elder
Horace belonged to the second of the above
classes, and some colour is given to this by
the association of the word with ¹ praeco.'
But Suetonius, or the author of Horace’s
life attributed to him, says that he was in
the employ of the ‘publicani' Also it is
questioned whether he continued his em-
ployment at Rome, or quitted it when he
left Venusia, or only took to it at Rome,—

a point we have no means whatever of
deciding.

87. at hoc nunc] The old editions nearly
all have ⁴ ob hoc,' which has very little MS.
authority, and seems clearly to be a correc-
tion of copyists, who wanted a preposition
for ‘ hoc,’ not consider-ing the independent
use of this word, which is the ablative.
Acron had ‘ ad haec ' in his copy, and
mentions another reading ‘ ad hoc! Bentley
adopts the former 111 place of ‘ ob hoc,' which
was then the received reading. Rutgersius
mentions one MS. with ‘ ab hoc,’ from
which he extracts what, with most of the
later editors, Ι conceive to be the true
reading, ‘at hoc,'
here, and ‘hoc,' in the 801180 of ‘ propter
hoc,' ἐπὶ τούτῳ, 18 commonly 118011 by
Horace. See in this Satire, v. 41, “‘Hoo
tibi Paullus et Messalla videris ?” and v. 52,
“ Felicem dicere non hoo me possum.” It
is also common in Caesar. ⁶ At hoo'is the
reading of Aldus’ edition of 1501, Οι·0111’8
St. Galle MS., and two mentioned by Fea
in the Vatican library. All the Blandinians
had ‘ ob hoc,' and two of the Berne ‘ ad hoc?

89. Nil me poeniteat sanum] ‘ 1 hope
while Ι have my senses I may never be
ashamed!
pression elsewhere, as in the last Satire, v.
44, “ Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus
amico.'’ S. ii. 3. 322, “ Quae si quis sanus
fecit sanus facis et tu.'’

90. dolo] Forcell. does not notice this
use of ‘ dolus.’ It is used like ‘ fraus' in
C. i. 28. 30, “ Negligis immeritis nocituram
postmodo te genitis fraudem committere,”
for 8 fault generally z ‘ dolo suo' by his own
fault.

93. Et vox et ratio :]

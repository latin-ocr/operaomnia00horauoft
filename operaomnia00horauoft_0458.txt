HORATII FLAGCI

Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.

‘⁶ At magnum fecit quod verbis Graeca Latinis 20
Miscuit.'' Ο seri studiorum! quine putetis

Difficile et mirum Rhodio quod Pitholeonti

Contigit? ‘⁶ At sermo lingua concinnus utraque

Suavior‚ ut Chio nota si commixta Falerni est.''

Cum versus facias, te ipsum percontor, an et cum 25

swern friends, Calvus and Catullus, but
merely to show that it required a more
vigorous taste than Hermogenes or De-
metrius possessed to appreciate or even to
read the writings of such men as Aris-
tophanes and his brethren, for whom he
had an unbounded admiration. Orelli
thinks he means 6ο express a poor opinion
of Calvus and Catullus, towards the latter of
whom he is said by some scholar-s to have
entertained an aversion: but I cannot see
why if a man were to say of a modern English
coxcomb who could do nothing better than
please a circle of ladies with a popular song
and agreeable voice, that he could sing
Moore's ballads from beginning to end but
could not understand a line of Shakspeare,
therefore he was disparaging that graceful
song writer, between whom and Shakspeare
there can be no comparison whatever, as
there could not be between Catullus and
Aristophanes.

20. quod verbis Graeca Latinia] This
is a new fault in Lucilius' style not before
mentioued. Seethe note on S. 4. 6. Cicero’s
advice in respect to the consistency of our
lives is illustrated thusz “ Ut enim sermone
eo debemus uti qui notus est nobis, ne ut
quidam Graeca verba inculcantes jure optimo
rideamur, sic in actiones omnemque vitam
nullam discrepantiam conferre debemus”
(De Off. i. 31). ‘Seri studiorum’ repre-
sents the Greek ὀψιμαθεῖς, to whom Theo-
phrastus devotes one of his least descriptiva
characters. In‘ quine putetis' the inter-
rogative enclitic is somewhat redundant,
but not more than in many other instanees,
as S. ii. ⁸2. 107, “ Uterne Ad casus dubios
fidet sibi certius ?'’ and 3. 295. 317. Orelli
says the construction is compounded of two,
‘ putatis ne ?' and ⁴ qui putetis ?’ comparing
Plautus (Trucul. ii. 6. 43),⁴ ‘Quine efiam-
sensatim: 4444 Base ‘iffi
sibi postputarit esse prae meo commodo!
where‘ putarit' is his own reading, the
indicative 15 the ordinary.

22. Rhodio quod Pitholeonti] The Scho-
liastsgiveusno helpinrespecttothis
person. They say he was an absurd writer
of epigrams, in which he mixed up Greek
words with the Latin. Torrentius was of
opinion, and Bentley and Weichert (Part.-
Lat. Rel. p. 333) of the same, that the
person meant is a treedman of one Otacilius,
whose name 118 bore (M. Otacilius Pitho-
laus), of whom Suetonius, in his life of
Julius Caesar (c. 75), says that he attacked
Caesar in some very abusive verses, but
that 118 took it with good temper. His
name was Pitholaus, but Horace might
change that termination without violafing
the Greek usage, as Τιμόλαος and Τιμό-
λεων, Μενέλαος and Μενέλεως, δια, are
different forms of the same name. There 15
some probability 1n the conjecture, and it' 15
at any rate impossibletoname any other per-
son with whom this man can be identified.

24. ut C'lu'o nota ei] On ‘ncta' see
C. ii. 3. 8. Here the Chian,.a sweet wine,
would represent the Greek as the rcugher
wine of Campania would stand for the lees-
polished Latin.

26. causa Petilli 1] See S. 4. 9, ιι.

27. Scilicet oblitus] Against all the
MSS. Bentley suggests, and Heindorf
adopts, ‘oblitosf to be governed by‘ malis!
The received reading, which addreaees itself
to the supposed advocate of a mixed lan-
guage, givesjustasgoodsense astheother,
in my opinion. Bentley revives the
of the old editions, ‘Lafini,’ which Inm-
binus, on good authority, since confirmed by
other MSS., changed ω ⁴ latine! Bentley
and Gesner, who follows him, cau find no
better explanation of ‘patris Latini’ than
king Latinus. With ‘oblitus ’ and ⁶ La-
fine’ the whole passage runs thus: ‘⁴ Yon
say that the language is more eleg-ant if it
be set off with Greek. But 1 ask you your·
self, is it only when you are writing poetry3
or supposingy you had on hand a difficult
cause, such as that of Petillius, would you
then likewise, forgetting your country and

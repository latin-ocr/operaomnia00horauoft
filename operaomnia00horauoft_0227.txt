CARMEN XXIV.
About A.u.c. 728.

· 'nnis ode is of the same class and was probably written about the same time as the

early oues of the third book, i. e. about Ans-c. 728. It deols with the licentious abusee
ofthetimee, und points indirectly ιο Augustus as the real reson-mer os them, as in the
second ode of the first book. Horace is never more powerfifl than when he handlae these
subieooe. whetherfiomawishtopleoeehispatronorfiomagenuinesenseofthe

ARGUMENT.

Iaet ι mm be as rich and extravagant as he may, yet, when Fato evei-takes him, feu· and
denthwillseizehim. The wandering tribes of the North with their free plains and
toils equally shared, where stepmothers nne kind and wivoe are obedient and ehaste,
and where crime meets with its reward,—are happier than we are. He who would
ςέο ι name for future times (for merit is only recognized aster death), let him put a
chock upon the lioentiousnees of the age. of what nse is it to oomplnin if ‹xx-ime goes
unpunished? Of what use are lnws without morals ? We are running every where in
quest of money, urged on by the shame of poverty. If we really repent, let us give
our gold ιο the gods or eost it into the see, eradicate theseedsof avarioe, andetrengthen
our minda with nobler pun-suits. Our youth are idle: their fathers lay up weelth by
fiand: for let n'ehee inmense as they will they always fall short of men's desim.

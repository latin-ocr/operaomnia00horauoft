Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque;
Sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt,

Plebs eris. At pueri ludentes, ‘⁶ Rex eris‚” aiunt,

“ Si recte facies.''

Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
Rosgia, dic sodes, melior lex an puerorum est ι

property, whatever your genius, character,
eloquence, and uprightness may be, you
are put down for one of the common sort,
and will not be allowed, under Otho's law,
to sit in the frunt rows! (See Epod. iv.
15, ιι.) Juvenal (v. 132) puts the opposite
case, and says:

‘⁸ analdi-ringenta tibi si quis Deus aut similis

Aut melior fatis donaret homuntio, quantus
Ex nihilo fies.”

‘Plebs' is not used in its regular sense,
but contemptuously, ‘ a common fellow.'
The equasti-ian order consisted of all citizens
who had the above income and were not
senators3 for when a man beoeme a senator
he cemed to be an ⁸ eques.’

59. At puer-i ludentes, Rex eris, airum]
See note on C. i. 36. 8, Plato makes So·
crates say (Theaet. i. 146, Steph.): τίς ἂν
ἡμῶν πρῶτος εἵποι; ὁ δὲ ἁμαρτων, καὶ ὃς
ἂν ἀεὶ ἁμαρτάνῃ, καθεδεῖται, ὥσπερ φασὶν
οἱ παῖδες οἱ σφαιρίζοντες, ὄνος· ’ὸς δ’ ἂν
περιγένηται ἀναμάρτητος βασιλεύσει ἡμῶν
καὶ ἐπιτάξει ὅτι ἂν βούληται ἀποκρίνεσθαι.
On which there is a long Scholiast's note :
τῶν οὖν παιζόντων ταῦτα (i. e. τὴν σφαῖ-
ραν) τούς μὲν νικῶντας βασιλεῖς ἐκάλουν,
καὶ ὅτι ἂν προσέτασσον τοῖς ἄλλοις imr-
v'rtouov, τοὺς δ’ ἡττωμένους ὄνους. They
who threw οι· caught the ball best were
mlled kings3 while they who were beaten
πω called asses. Some such game must
have been in use among the Roman boys,
and their king-making had become a pro-
verb. The world may daepise you, he sayS,
because you are poor, but, according to the
boys' rule which makes the best man king,
you shall be a king if you do well. As to
‘murus aeneus' see C. iii. 3. 65, n. For

signifioe a sort of song of triumph. The
note just referred to may be corrected by
this explanation. Thmugh a mistake of
mine or the printeffs, this ‘ nenia ⁷ has been
made to stand for a night-song, as in C. iii.

The persons referred to areM. Curius Den- ·

tatus, the conqueror of Pyrrhus, and M.
Furius Camillus, the man who saved Rome
from the Ganls. Curius¹ contempt for
money is especially related by Cicero (de
Senect. c. 16) in terms which account for
Horace’s selecting him for an illustration
here: “Curio ad focum sedenti magnum
auri pondus Samnites cnm attulissent, re-
pudiati ab eo sunt; non enim aurum habere
praeclarum sibi videri dixit, sed iis qui
haberent aurum imperare.'’ The boys'
strain was ever in the months of these
noble soldiers, giving honour to none but
theworthy. ‘Mares'isusedinthis sense
in A. P. 402: ‘⁴ Tyrtaeusque mares animos
in Martia bella Versibus exacuit?

Flebnnt amici et bene noti mortem meam,

We know nothing more of him than this.
‘Lacr-imosa’ is used ironically. As to
‘responsare' see S. ii. 7. 85. ‘Praesens'
means stands by you and urges you on,
and teaches you to meet the insulta or
fortune with an independent heart and
erect bearing. The editio princeps and
nearly all the old editions have ‘optat'

SATIRARUM I. 8. 411

SATIRE VIII.

On the outside of the city walls, in sront of Mons Esquilinus, lay the Campus Esqui-

linum-in whichwas a public burial-gronnd for-the poorest of the people, and the Sestertium

ᾗ or place of execution sor slaves and others of the lower sort, whose bodies were lest un-

” buried for the dogs and vultures to prey upon (see Epod. v. 100). This place, which

must always have been a public nuisance and a source of malaria, was given (as some say)

hyadeoeeeof the senate to Maecenas, or else purchased byhim,cleared,drained,and

’ ¹ laid out in gardens, in which he asterwards built a handsome house (see C. iii. 29. Epod.

ix„ xiv. Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). His example was afterwards followed by a member

of the home of Lamia, in whose gar-dens Caligula was buried (Suet. Calig. c. 59). The

following Satire was suggested by a figure of Priapus set up in Maecenas' garden. The

’ god ia represented as eontrasting the present state of the ground with what it once was,

by which a compliment is conveyed to Maecenas for his public spirit in ridding the city of

sudi a nuiaance. Priapus is also made to complain of the trouble he has in keeping the

’ ground clear of trespassers, but more particularly of the witches, who, having formerly

carried on their practices among the tombs and bones of the dead, continued to haunt

the scene of their iniquity. This is introduced for the purpose of dragging in the woman

⁷ -whom Horace safirized under the name of Gratidia. The description is in some parts

very like that of tha fisth Epode, and the two may have been written about the same time.

It h not very likely Horace would have maintained his war-fare with this woman, whoever

alm wa or whatever her offeme, for several years. Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 16), because ’

in S. ii. 3. 312 reference is made to Maecenas as engaged in building, places these two

,ί Satires in consecutive years, this being written ΛΑΜ). 721 (see Introduction to Epod. v.)-

Butthoeeis not much in this argument. Τὴε clearIng, draining, and enclosing of the

ε Α ground must have taken some time, and it may have been several years before it was fit

forlivingon, and no reference is made to a house in this satire. Franke places itin
mmo. 718. There is very little clue to the date.

Theocritus has an epigram about Priapus
(4), iu which he desoeibos him thus· —

τήναν τὰν λαύραν τόθι ταὶ ὄρυες, αἰπόλε,

of the god he is prayed to for deliverance
from the power of love, and Horace, who
treats him so contemptuously here, speaks
of him elsewhere (Epod. ii. ), in conjunction
with Silvanus, as receiving the sacrifice due
to him. No one could better haveap appre-

thinking, whether in respect to this deity
or any other, the ironical description of the
prophet Isaiah (xliv. 9—<2o)‚ which corre-

is no stroke m the whole of that description

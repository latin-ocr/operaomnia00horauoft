Mantica cui lumbos onere ulceret atque eques armos:
Objiciet nemo sordes mihi quas tibi, Tilli,

Cum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur

Te pueri lasanum portantes oenophorumque.

Hoc ego commodius quam tu, praeclare senator,
Quacunque libido est,

Milibus atque aliis vivo.

Incedo solus; percontor quanti olus ac far3
Fallacem Circum vespertinumque pererro

supellex” (Pers. S. iv. 52). Others suppose
it to be a stout short-bellied animal. I do
not pretend to decide; but it was an ‘un-
sightly beast, whatever it was Horace
meant.

105. usque Tarentum] Along the most
frequented of all the roads, the Via Appia,
and to the farthest part of Italy, carrying
his portmanteau behind him. Public officers
could not go beyond a certain distance
from Rome without the permission of the
senate.

107. Tilli,] Orelli assumes that this is
the person mentioned before (v. 24) as
military tribune, and that he was afterwards
made praetor. But 1 do not see why
Horace should have mentioned him in the
lower office at a time when he must have
held a higher. He appears to have been a
parsimonious person, going into the country
with no company of friends, but only five
slaves to attend him (see note on S. i. 3. ll),
carrying a jar of their master's cheap wine,
and an utensil vthat ill represented the
dignit-y of his curule chair. The Via Tibur-
tina left Rome hythe Esquiline gate, and
bore that name as far asTibur, from whence
the Via Valeria oompleted the communica-
tion with Aternum on the Adriatic.

111. ΜίΙίὸιιε atque aliia] This is the
reading of all the MSS. Lambinus oon-
jectured ‘ multis,’ and Heindorf has adopted
that word, considering that ‘milia' in the
plural is always a substantive. But that 15

112. quanti olus ac fam] Horace
means, as Orelli says, that he lounges in
the market and talks freely to the market
people, without fear of lowering his dignity
or being remarked.

113. Fallacem circ-um] Comm. Cmq.
probably gives the right meaning of this,
saying: “ Fallacem dixit propter Sarmadacos
et sortilegos mathematicos, qui ad metas
spectatores circumstabant et imperitos sorti-

bus et 1111315 fallebant? ‘Sarmadaci' (or
more properly ‘Samardaciff is 3 Greek
word, the origin of which 15 unknown· it
was adopted by ecclemastical writers. Au-
gustin (cont. Academ. iii. 15) uses it for 511
impostor, while chrysostom interpr-ets it
γελωτόποιος. Plautus (Paenulus, 1.5.11

‘¹ Itaque replebo, atritate 511101 multo ut

and Cicero (de Divin. i. 58) declares his un-
belief in all those impostors that pretend
to prophetie and mystical knowledge, in
the words of Ennius :—

“ Non habeo nauci Marsum augura, “
Νο11 vicanos haruspioes, 11011 116 Circo

Non Isiacos conjectores, 11011 interpretes

See S. ⁴. 10. Epp. i. 1³. 49. The notion
of this Scholiast is, that Horace extemporized
this anathema against Demetrius and Tigel-
lius, and then told his amanuensis to go
before he forgot it and add it to the Satire
as his ⁴ subse-iptio? 'which in letters was the
word ⁴ vale,’ or something civil os that sort.
This interpretation may be admitted without
disturbing the notion that ⁴ libellus’ signifies
the whole book, including these ten Satires,
though it might equally suit the present one.
See Pers. i. 120. 1 think ‘subscribe’ has
the meaning above given, and am inclined
to take ‘libello' for the Satire, not the
book, which Orelli and Dillenbr. take it to
mean, foll Bentley, who, in his pre—
sace,takaethatmeaning for granted. The

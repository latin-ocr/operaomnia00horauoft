he was about twenty. Whether his father was alive affthat time 01(

dead is uncertain. If he went to Athens at twenty, it was in Adi-c.
709, the year before Julius Caesar was assassinated. ''After t. event
Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to Greece. For eing 17113

struggle that was before them, they got round them many of the young

men at that time studying at Athens, and Horace gras appointed tri-
bune ⁷ in Brutus’ army, a high command for which he was not qualified.
He went with Brutus into Asia Minor, and finally shared his defeat at
Philippi, A. U. c. 712. He makes humorous allusion to this defeat m his
Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the battle he came to Italy,
having obtained permission to do so, like many others who were willing
to give up a desperate cause and settle quietly at home. His patri-
mony⁸ ‚ however, was forfeited‚ and he seems to have had no means of
subsistence, which induced him to employ himself inwriting verses, with
the view perhaps of bringing himself into notice⁹ rather than for vthe
purpose of making money by their sale. It is not impossible, however,⁴
that some of his earliest compositions were severe persona] 33171133 and
lampoons, written at the instigation of those who were able 170 pay
him for them. That the book of Epodes which we possess does not

contain all that he wrote in Archilochus' vein, I think is pretty cer- ·

tain3 and the same Ι believe may be said of the books of Satires. Pro-
bably his earliest efforts were more severe and licentious than those
which his judgment allowed him afterwards to pubhsh, though some

of these are bad enough. With Archilochus and Lucilius before him ι

as models, and without the experience he afterwards gained, his earliest
productions may without difficulty be supposed to have been such
as in later h'fe he would condemn. By some means 113 managed to
get a place as scriba¹ in the Quaestor’s office, whether by purchase
or interest does not appear. In either case we must suppose he con-
trived soon to make friends, though he could not do so by the come
he pursued without also making many enemies. His Satires are full of
allusions to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted‚ among other literary persons, with Virgil and
Varius, who about three years after his return (A.u.c. 715) introduced
him to Maecenas, who was careful of receiving into his circle Brutus’
tribune, and one whose writings were of a kind that was newjmd un-
popular. He accordingly saw nothing of Horace for nine months after
his introduction to him. He then sent for him (A.U.c. 716), and from

poverty made him desperate and cai-eleas of consequenoeS, but that when he became oom-

paratively rich he lost that stimulus. ¹ Suet. vit. S. ii. θ. 36.

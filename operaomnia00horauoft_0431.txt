fastum: to choose with reference ιο am-
bition whatever parents each man might
desire. Most of the editions are so pointed

‘optaret,' aud the sense to be‘ optaret sibi
quisque( each man might choosep for him-
self, oreaehmau would choose, as Lambinus
says. But ιὀριο will hardly bear this
sense hene¹ aud the position οἱ· q-uoscun

We know nothing of Horace's mother,
whom he probably lost in very early life;
but he here intimates his respect for her

that reading has older and better authority
than ‘ honestos! The Blandinian MSS. aud
all Cruquius' others had ‘ honestos! Tor-
tentius denies Lambinus’ assertiou. which
Rutgersius defends. (Lect. Ven. c. 17.)
But ‘ onustos’ in all probability arose out
,of v. 99. The Scholiasts had ‘ honestos!
On the ‘fasces’ and‘ sella curulis,' their
nature, and the officers entitled ιο use

, them, all information may be obtained from
Smitl'x’ s Dict. Ant.

he must buy a number of horses aud slaves
of the lower sort. ‘’Caloues were properly
slaves who went with the army, carrying
the heavier part of the soldiers’ accoutre-

domestic slaves employed ou meuial work.
ΤΙιο ⁸ petorritum ’ was a four- wheeled car-
riage. peGellius, who has a chapter on the
subject (xv. 30), affirms, on the authority of
Varro, that it was introduced from Gaul
beyond the Alps. Festus says the name is
derived from the number of its wheels‚ and
the Welsh ‘pedwar,' ‘fuum’ and ‘riden,'
⁴ wheels,’ make the Celtic origin of the name
not improbable. (See Gronovius' note οιι
the above passage of Gellius.) The Aeolio
form πίτυρες, and the Oscan ‘petnr,’
‘ four: and the Latin ‘ rota,’ show that the
above is not the only etymology of which
¹ petorritum ' is capable. comm. Cruq. on
Epp. ii. l. 192, says the ¹ petorritum ' was
used for the eonveyance of female slaves3
but there is no reason to suppose it was
limited to that use.

104. curto Ire licet mulo] ThisF'orcel-
lini interprets, aster Comm. Cmq., ‘ docked.’
Orelli says this is only an English practice,
and supposes it to have been unknown to
the Romans. But whoever Cruquius' mys-
terious *Scholiast may have been, he πω
not an Englishman‚ nor of very modern
times. He must have seen ‘docked' horses,
for no man would imagine them that had
not. The interpretation ‘castratos which
Orelli attributes to ForcelL, does not appear
in the English edition of his Lexicon.
Orelli interprets ⁴ curto ’ ‘ cheap‚’ as ⁴⁸ Te-

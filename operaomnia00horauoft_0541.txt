Νοιι etiam sileas. Davus sis comicus atque
Stes capite obstipo, multum similis metuenti.

former, aud means that he should not
speek before he was spoken to. On ‘ ultro'
see C. iv. 4. 51, ιι. It is a difficult word
to mute, and seems awkwardly placed
here. As to ⁴ non ’ for ‘ ue,' compare Epp.
i. 18. 72: “Non andus tuum jecur ulceret
ulhpuerve·’'andA.P.:‘460 nonsitqui
tollere curet.” Quintilian says this is a
soloecism (i. 5. 50):‘ ‘qui dicat pro illo‘ ne
feeeris' ‘non feceris' inidem incidat vitium,
quis alterum negandi est, alterum νειιιιιιιι.η

91. Dum eis con-iem] Horace has
tudeins.7oft13isbook: “Jamdudum
auscultem et mpiens tibi dicere servus
Pauca reformido?

92. Stes eapite obstipa] Suetonius,
desm‘bing Tiberius, says (c. 68),ι ‘incedebat
cervice rigida et obsfipa;” “hic est qui

Graecis dicitur βυσαύχην, nam βύειν est

bon).Arri1m ιιι Epictetus speaks osa man

as though he had swallowed a spit:

τί ἡμῖν ὀβελίσκον καταπιὼν περιπατεῖς;

(quoted iu the same note of Cas. on Suet.
Lo.) The booby in Persius (S. ιιι. 80)
turns up his nose ut the philosophers
who go about‘ ‘obstipo capite et figentes
lumina terrisss' It means therefore stiff,
unbending, or bent downwards, with the
eyes fixed on the ground. As ω’ multum
similis: see S. i. agro 57, n.

93. Obsequio grassare. -] ⁴ Grassor’ is a
frequentative formof‘ gradior‚' and signifies
to go ou, advanee. The expression in the
text is li'ke⁶ grassaridolo’ (Tac. Hist. iv.
16), and other like phrases. Livy and
Tacitus use the word osten. The MSS.
vary between ‘increbuitf ‘membrum' and

‘incr-spuit! Fee adopts the last, though
he must have been aware that the quantity
of the second syllable is short. All the
Paris MSS. have‘ increpuit’ or ‘increbuit’
excep t three, which have‘ increbruit! The
oldest Bland. had ‘ increbmit,' the others
all ‘inoeepuit.’ One of the Berne has

‘ increbuit‚’ another ⁴ increpui& and 1 take
the latter to be merely a corruption intro·
duced by copyists who found ‘increbuit'
and thought it was wrong. Lambinus,
Torrentius, end others argue for ⁸ increbruit:
which form appears in every instance in the
Medicean MS. of virgil. (See V. 1.. Georg.
i. 359, Wagner). Orelli approvoe that form,
Heindorf the other. It should be observed
thet the root of the word is ‘cr-eb? and
that the second ‘r' is no partof the root.
Whether it improves or injures the sound
of the word must be matter of opinion, and
ιιι the conflict of MSS. the question can
hardly be decided with certainty. It is

95. aurem substrinye loquaci] ‘Stringo'
means tn grasp in the hand; ‘aurem sub-
stringe ' therefore may mean ιο hold up the
ear as we commonly do when we wish to
catch every word that is said. Other ex-
planations hsve been gi,ven but they all
come to the same point, which cannot be
mistaken.
attention to the old man, let him be as
garrulous as he would. “Arrige aurem
subjecta manu et quasi collige. Sic vestis
substringi dicitur quae attollitur et accingi-

flattery, plyhimwith it till even he isforced
to cry ‘hold, enoughl’ and blow him up
with your fulsome breeth like a bladder.
Though the old man might say he had had
enough, he was not to be taken at hisword,
but plied suu har-der, for he never could
have too much. If the man's tect were nt
all proportioned to his servility, this advice
might be of use to him3 otherwise it would
only do ιιι very gross ceses.‘1mportunus'
Lambinus explains as ‘is qui nunquam
conquiescit neque aliis conquiescendi potes-
tatem facit.” The expression ‘Ohe jam
satis' iscommon. SeeS.i..‚5l2Jaud
Martial (iv. 91):

“Ohe Jam satis est, ohe libelle,
Jam pervenimus usque sd umbilicum.”

Primum nam inquiram quid sit furere : hoc si erit in te
Solo nil verbi pereas quin fortiter addam.

Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri

31. Ο bone, ne te Frustra-m] ⁸ My good
sir, don’t deceive yourself! We have ‘ ο
'2⁰90 ’obelow (S. 6. 51). It is like the Greek
ω γα ε.

32. prope omnem] Stertinius would not
allow of any excepfions to this rule (see
note on v. 44), and ‘ prope' therefore may
be looked upon, not as limiting ¹ omnes,'
but perhaps as sostening the expression a
little. 1 do not know how else to account
for it. It is hard to give the word a dis-
tinct meaning in C. iv. 14. 20, and below in
the 268th verse of this Satire (see note on
the former passage). The Greeks would
use ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ὶιι the same way.

33. Stertinius] See Introduction. ‘Crepo'
is no where else used in a good sense, and
it is put into Damasippus' mouth ironically.
⁴ Unde’ may mean ‘from whom,’ i. e.
Stertinius, or from which preaching, the
:lintecedent implied in ⁴ crepat.ss The former

prefer.

35. pascere barbam] See above, v. 17,
n. πωγωνοτροφεῖν is a term used by the
later Greek writers. The Pons Fabricius,
from which Damasippus was going to throw
himself into the river aster he became bank-
rupt, connected the Insula 'liberine with
the left bank, and was just outside the walls,
facing the south end of the Mons Capito-
linus. It had lately (A.u.c. 692) been re-
built with stone, having been formerly (as
may be supposed) made of wood. (Dion
Cass. xxxvii. 45). There are still ruins of
this bridge, which now bears the name
Ponte di Quattro Capi. The Fabricius who
built it, and whom Comm. Cruq. calls
Consul, was Curator Viarum, as appears by

an inscription upon one of the arches. The
same Scholiast says in his time itwas called
Pons Lapideus, which may have been its
name with the common people. ἱ
38. Cave saris] The last syllable in
‘eave’ used with the subjunctive (some-
times with and sometimes without ‘ut') is
always short. In ω the forms
‘faxo ' (‘ fac-so’) for ‘fecum' ‘faxim’ Osac-
sim’) for ‘ fecerim‚’ ‘farem' (wne-soff) for
‘fecissem,' see Key’s 1.. G. 566. ‘ Pudor
malus' is what the Frenchaeall ⁴ mauvaise

40. insanus haberi] Thoas persona who

marks. Suoeess was their orites-ion of
wisdom, as it is with most peopls. ¹ Qui
vereare,' ⁸ bemuse you are airaid.⁸
41. Primum nam inquiram] ‘Nan ’ is
sometimes used to introduce an explanation
as here and in Epp. i. 1. 76. compare
Caesar(B. G. iii. 28)= ‘⁴ Morini Menapiique
longe alia ratione ac reliqui Gaui bellum
agere instituerunt. Nam quod intelligebant
maximas nationes quae proelio contendis-
sent, pulsas superatasque esse, continentes-
que silvas ac paludes habebant, eo se suaque
omnia contulerunt.” (See Key’s 1.. G. 1⁴52.)
44. Chrysippi portic-uc] This was the
στοὰ ποικίλη οι· picture-gallery nt Athens,
in which Zeno first taught, and from which
his followers derived their name. The
Stoice seem to have admitted no mean
between perfect wisdom or virtue and abso-
lute solly or vice. ἀρέσκει δὲ αὐτοῖς μηδὲν

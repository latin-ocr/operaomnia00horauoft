CARMINUM III. 2.

’ Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
Intaminatis fulget honoribus,
Nec sumit aut ponit secures

Arbitrio popularis aurae.

Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.

Est et fideli tuta silentio

Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum

says Jani = ‘absurdius ’ might have been
better. Livy might have corrected him, who
tells how 500 Numidians feu upon the Ro-
mans, ‘⁴ tergaque ac poplites caedentes stra-
gem ingentem fecerunt ’' (xxii. 48). ⁴ Tergo '
is not opposed to ⁴ poplitibus,’ but coupled

⁷ with it, aud ‘timido' applies to both (see
note οιι C. i. -2. 1).

17. Virtus repuleae nescia sordidae]

‘Nescia’ seems to mean ⁴ unconscions σίζ’
because ⁴ indifferent to' the disgrace of re-
jecflon, which, if disgraceful to any, is not
so to the virtuous, but to those who reject
them. Dillenbr. interprets otherwise, that
the virtuous do not seek honours, and there-
fore do not know the discredit of defeat ; but
that is conia-ary to fact, and therefore not
likely to be Horace's meaning.

18. Intaminatia] This word, not being
found elsewhere, has been much discussed.
Like ⁴,coniaminatus ’ ⁴,attaminatus ' it is
derived from the obsolete word⁴ taminoss
and contains the root‘ tag’ of ‘tango’ as

’.does ‘In contaminatis' is the
reading of a few MSS. H. Stephens (Diat.
ii. 1) says, “Ex quam plurimis manu-
scriptis exemplaribus afferri videmus⁴ incon-
taminatis,”’ which is simply an invention,
Cru-
quius adopts it in his text (Orelli says ⁴⁴ e
Codd.,” bnt 1 think he is mistaken, for Cru-
quius notioae none in his commentary, where
he has ‘intaminatis '), and his Scholiast had
the same reading. The other Scholiasts had
⁴ intaminatis? which is the reading of an the
editionsl have seen, except those of Cunning-
ham and Sanadon. Lambinus and Bentley
editthis, but prefer the other; but the latter
affiden’tly answers his own and the only
argument against the received reading, by
υεὶίιις,6 ‘Are there not other words in
Horace, Cicero, and others, which, through

the loss of so many writers, we find no
where else ?”

20. Arbitrio popularis aurae] This word
which plainly means that the popular judg-
ment is like a shisting breeze, setting now
this way, now that, appears in Virgil (Aen.
vi. 817) :—

⁴⁴ Nimium gaudens popularibus auris,”
and in Lucan (i. 132) :—

‘⁴ Totus popularibus auris
Impelli plausuque sui gaudere theatriss’

Compare for the sentiments C. iv. 9. 39, sqq.

25. Est et fideli tuta silentio] Simonides,
in the same poem (Bergk sayS, p. 767) from
which the former quotation comes (v. 14, n),
says—

ἐστὶ καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίνδυνον γέρας,

which words it appears Augustus was ac-
quainted with and approved. When Atheno-
dorus was about to leave his camp he em-
braced the emperor and said, ‘⁴ O Caesar,
whenever thou art wroth, say nothing, do
nothing, till thou hast gone over in thy
mind the twenty-four letters of the alpha-
bet.'' Whereupon the emperor took him
by the hand and said, ‘¹ I have need of thee
still ;” and he detained him a whole year,
saying, ‘⁴ Silence too hath its safe reward! ¹
(Plut. Apophthegm. Reg. et Imper. Caesar.
Aug. 7.) Secrecy is a sign of good saith,
and not an easy one to practise. Horace's
indignation is levelled against the breaking
of saith generally, and the divulging of the
secrets of Ceres (whose rites, however, it
appears were only attended by women) is
only mentioned by way of illustration.
Doering suggests, by way of accounting for
the introduction of this particular virtue,
that some notorious act of treachery is
referred to indirectly. But the introduction

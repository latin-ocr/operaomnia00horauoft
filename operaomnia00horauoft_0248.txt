HORATII FLAGGI

INTERMISSA, Venus, diu
Rursus bella moves? Parce, precor, precor.
Non sum qualis eram bonae

Sub regno Cinarae.

Desine, dulcium
Mater saeva Cupidinum,

Circa lustra decem flectere mollibus
J am, durum imperiis: abi
Quo blandae juvenum te revocant preces.

Tempestivius in domum
Paulli purpureis ales oloribus

comissabere Maximi,

10

Si torrere jecur quaeris idoneum:
Namque et nobilis et decens
Et pro sollicitis non tacitus reis

Et centum puer artium

Late signa feret militiae tuae,

2. Rursus bella moves 7] The Scholiast
Acron says this ode is an allegorical address
to Venus praying her not to compel him to
write any more love poetry, which notion is
generally adopted. Ι think it is a mistake.

3. Non sum qualis eram] Epp. i. l. 4.
He here calls Cinara good, because she is
dead ; elsewhere he calls her ‘ rapax’ (Epp.
i. 14. 33). It seems likely this name re-
presents a real person, whether she appears
under another name elsewhere or not, and
that Horace had an affection for her. In
the thirteenth ode of this book (v. 22) her
death is mentioned with feeling, and there
is a reality in the references to her in all the
places where she is alluded to, which cannot
be connected with fiction. She was associ-
ated in all probability with Horace’ s early
days. Κυνάρ u signifioe, some say, a wild
rose thorn (κυνόσβατος); κινάρα, an arti-
choke.

5. Mater saeva Cupidinum, ] Repeated
from i. 19. 1. Horace here does not copy
himself I believe, but some Greek original.
Ι (10 not know what Orelli means when he
says ‘⁴ versiculus hic consulto repetitur.”
⁴ Flectere’ is a metaphor taken from the
breaking in of a horse.

9. in domum] So Livy (xl. 7),
comissatum ad fratrem imus.'’ Here ‘co—
missabere ’ is equivalent to ¹ comissatum
ibis,’ and therefore the reading ⁴ in domum'
is correct. But ‘in domo’ has the autho-
rity of the two oldest Berne and other MSS„
and is the reading of Lambinus and most of
the older editors. ¹ In domum,’ however,

“ Quin

is less likely to have been invented than ¹ in
domo,' and 111 the whole of the the
idea of motion is contained, as 111 *(1111, ’

‘,ales'‘quaeris.’Pu1-pureis'(whichAfloi1
rightly int e‘rprets nitidis, pulchris’ ) nvom-s
of the Greek, and κωμ α’,σδω ποτὶ τὰν’ Apu:-
ρύλλιδα (Tlieoc. iii. 1) shows that Horace
has here adopted a Greek 11110111.Κώμῳ
χρέεσθαι’ ες ἀλλήλους occurs in Herodotus
(i. 21). The Paullus Maximus here men-
tioned is called by the Sdiolintu‘ ‘nobilia
et disertus adolescens et volupiae-up
which is plainly a mere nou'on of thais-*own
derived from the ode itself, and shows that
they at least knew nothing about him.
Paullus Fabius Maximus was a favam-ito
with Augustus, and consul Α.11.ο. 743. Ῑῐ
therefore he be the person meant. ho is
oelled‘ aboy' in joke‚ thoughitdooe not
follow that he was of the full eonnlar age
in 743; that rule fell into disuse aster Ψο

again. Buthehad a son whowasagreat-
friend of Ovid s, and who was about twenty
at this time, and some editors (Torrentius,
Jani, Orelli, and others) think he is the
youth Horace alludes to (see Ovid, ex Ponto,
i.2. 1). He could only have been begin-
ning his advocate' s career, if this be the
person, which I am inclined to doubt.

‘Torrere jecur’ is like Theocritus’ ὀπτεύ-
μενος ἐξ Ἀφροδίτης (vii. 55).

14. sollicitis non tacitus reis] Compm
C. ii. l. 13, where he calls Pollio “ Insigne
moestis praesidium reis.'¹

CARMEN XXXV.
A.U.C. 728.

When Augustus was meditating an expedition against the Britons and another for the
East, Horace commended him to the care of Fortune the pressi-ver, as Pindar- committed
the sons of Himera:

Λίσσομαι, παῖ Ζηνὸς Ἐλευθερίου,

Ἱμέραν εὐρυσθένέ ἀμφιπόλει, Σώτειρα 'mxu-
τὶν γὰρ ἐν πόντῳ κυβερνῶνται θοαὶ

νᾶες, ἐν χέρσῳ δὲ λαιψηροὶ πόλεμοι

κάγοραὶ βουλαφόροι. (Olymp. xii.)

Which passage probably Horace had m mind. The last expedition against Britain oon- ’
templated by Augustus was A. u. c. 728 (Dion Cass. 53. 25), which was interruptos by uu ,ί
insurrection of the Salassians, an Alpine people ἐς τὴν Βρεταννίαν ἐπειδὴ μὴ ἠθελησαν “

ὁμολογῆσαι στρατευσείοντα κατέσχον οι Σαλάσσιοι. At the same time he was prop-ring
the force that was to conquer Arabia (see C. 29 of this book). To this year ulmo '
the composition of this ode may be assigned. ¹ ’

The oldest temples of the goddess Fortune were at Rome, where we learn stom
Plutarch (on the Fortune of the Romans, c. x.). τὰ τῆς Τύχης ἱερὰ πάμπολλα καὶ παλαιὰ
καὶ λαμπρὰ τιμαῖς πάσαις ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἐνίδρυται καὶ καταμέμιιεται τοῖς firtonum-‹1⁹-
τοις μέρεσι καὶ τόποις τῆς πόλεως. sse oldest of her templae was dedicated to Fortuna
Virilis by Ancus Martius (Plutarch says). There was another to Fortuna Muliebris,
founded in commemoration of the victory of Coriolanus’ mother over her song and
Servius Tullius founded two on the Capitoline hill to Fortuna Primigenia and Fortuna
Obsequens: on the Palatine hill there were two to Fortuna Privata and Fortuna Vanum.
There was also a Fortuna Virginalis and a Fortuna Bonae Spei, a Fortuna Mascula,
ἄλλαι τε μύριαι Τύχης τιμαὶ καὶ ἐπικλήσεις ὧν τάς πλείστας Σεροῦἶος κατέστησεν,
εἰδὼς ὅτι μεγάλη ῥοπὴ, μᾶλλον δὲ. ὅλον, ἡ Τύχη παρὰ πάντα ἐστὶ τὰ τῦν ἅνθρῶτων
πράγματα. But the worship of this goddess was most solemnly maintained, when
Horace wrote, at Praeneste and at Antium, where shehad an oraclo. The Roman concep-
tion of this divinity was probably different from that of the Greeks, who thought of her ⁷
chiefly as a capricious goddess and blind. But that such was not the only idea of he· >
even among the Greeks is plain from Pindar’s ode above quoted. Pindar in other pom·
now lost described her as φερέ πτολις, the supporter of states3 also as one of the Μοῖραι,
and the most powerful of them3 but elsewhere as ἀπευθὴς, uncertain, unknown3 in ’
which character easual altars were erected to her by the Greeks as ἄγνωστος eedem*
See St. Paul’s address to the Athenians in Acts xvii. 233 also Pausanias, iv. 3⁰3
vii. 26; and Plutarch’s Treatise above mentioned, caps. 4 and 10. From Plutarch'a ⁴
sumunt she would appear to be the one divinity held from the earliest times in reputa* ι
by the Romans. How far Horace may have drawn the attributes and manau

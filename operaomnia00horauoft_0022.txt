book, of which one or two poems are among Horace’s effliest composi·
tions, may have been published in A.U.c. 724. In that ‘yearwus written,
as it would seem, the sixth Satire of the second book, w ' h book
therefore was not probably published till the end of '724'01- the ‘ ‘
of the next year, when Horace was about thirty-five years old.

When Augustus returned from Asia, in ΛΑΜ). 726, and dosed the ’

gates of J anus, being the acknowledged head of the republic, Horace
appeared amongst his most hearty adherents. He wrote on this occasion
one of his best Odes (i. 2), and employed his pen in forwarding those
reforms which it was the first object of Augustus to effect. (See Intro-
duction to G. 11. 15.) His most striking Odes appear for the most part
to have been written after the establishment of peace. Some may have
been written before, and probably were. But for some reason it would

seem that he gave himself more to lyric poetry after his thirty-fifth year

than he had done before. He had most likely studied the Greek poeta- .

while he was at Athens, and some of his imitations may have been
written early. If so, they were most probably improved and polished ’
from time to time (for he must have had them by him, known perhaps
only to a few friends, for many years) till they became the graeeful
specimens of artificial composition that they are. Horace continued to
employ himself in this kind of writing (on a variety of subjecte, eon-
vivial‚ amatory, political, moral; some original, many no doubt suggested
by Greek poems) till A.u.c. 730, when Ι am inclined to think the three
first books of the Odes were published. Ι cannot here discuas the
subject, but I have considered and stated in the case of each Ode the
evfflences, if any, that it contains of its date, and Ι can find none which
may not be placed in that year or before it. Bentley’s theory, which
limits Horace to one species of composition at a time, and supposes each

of the three first books of Odes to have been published separately, I have· ’

no faith in; and he overlooks the fact that the twenty-fourth Ode of tho
first book was, certainly written four years after that in which-he places
the publication of that book. Olinton, who supports Bentley (Fast. Heu.
nc. 38), can only do so by supposing that in the present copies some
pieces may have been transposed, which is begging the question«
Franke has arrived, as far as Ι can judge, at the right conclusion upon*

this subject. During this period Horace appears to h‘ave passed -his -

time at Rome among the most distinguished men of the day, or at his
house in the country, paying occasional visits to Tibur, Praeneste,
and Baiae, with indifferent health, which required change of air. ·
About the year A.U.c. '728 he was nearly killed by the falling of a ,ξ

tree, on his own estate, which accident he has recorded in one of his '‹.
Odes (ii. 13), and occasionally refers to; once in the same stanna with a ,

CARMINUM III. 30. :215

CARMEN XXX.

whether this ode m written ns the Epilogue οῖ the third book, or of the three first
published together, must be determined by the data discussed in the general introduction
prefixed to the odes. It expresses a conviction, which time has ratified, that through his
odes Horace had achieved an immol-tal name. The same just pride had been shown by
poet· before him; ns by Sappho, in a poein of which the first line only has been pre·
med, μνάσασθαί τινά φαμι καὶ ὕστερον ἀμμέων (16 Bergk); and by Ennius, in the
well-known lines——

“ Nemo me lacrumis decoret nec funera fletu

Fuit. eur? volito vivu’ per orn virum,”

which words virgil has made his own (Georg. iii. 9). Propertius (iii. 1), Ovid (Met. xv.
871, oqq.), and Martial (x. 2. 7, sqq), have all imitated Horace very closely. 'rhem is
no exn-avagunee but much dignity in the langa-ge of Horace, and 1 see no real resem-
blance between the tone of this ode and C. ii. 20, with which it is oompned (see

Introduction).

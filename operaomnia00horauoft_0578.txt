HORATII FLAGGI

Est mihi purgatam erebro qui personet aurem:

Solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne

Peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat.

Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pon0‚ lo
Quid verum atque decens curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum ;
Gondo et compono quae mox depromere possim.

Ac ne forte roges quo me duce, quo lare tuter,

Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri

Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes. 15
Nunc agilis fio et mersor civilibus undis,

torial shows at this time were exhibited in
the Circus. The arena was separated from
the seats, which went round the building,
by a wall called the ⁴ podium‚’ near which
a gladiator would station himself to appeal
to the compassion of the people, at whose
request it usually was that they got their
freedom and the ‘rudis.' We learn from
Juvenal that the persons of highest condi-
tion sat by the ‘podium,' and to their in-
fluence the appeal would be more imme-
diately made. He says (ii. 145):

“ Et Capitolinis generosior et Marcellis

Et Catulis Paulisque minoribus et Fabiis et'

Omnibus ad podium spectantibus.’'

Lipsius (de Amphith. c. xi.) supposes that
there was between the ‘ podium ’ and lowest
seat a level space, in which the principal
personages sat, the curule officers in their
own chairs. Veianius, Horace says, retired
into the country to escape the temptation
to engage himself again, and to place him-
self in the position he had so often occu-
pied of a suppliant for the people’s favour.
When they liked a man they were not easily
persuaded to ask for his discharge.

7. Est milti purqatam] He has a voice
within him, he says, the office of which is to
whisper in his attentive ear the precept that
follows, the idea of which is taken from
Ennius, who takes it from the Circus. His
words, in Cicero de Senect. (c. 5) are,—

“ Sicut fortis equus spatio qui saepe su-
remo
Vicitp Olympia, nunc senio confectu’
quiescit.”

The reverse of ‘purgatam aurem,¹ which
was a conventional expression, is found
in the next Epistle (v. 53), “ auriculas col-
lecta sorde dolentes.”

9. ilia ducat.] ⁴ Ilia trahere ’ or ‘ dnoere’
are ordinary expressions for panting: they
mean to contract the flanks‚ as is done in
the act of recovering the breath. The re-
verse is ‘ilia tendere! See Virg. Georg.

iii. 506, “imaque longo Ilia singultu teu-
dunt.''
broken winded.

10. et versus et cetera ludicra poam]
He did not keep his word, for he wrote
much of the fourth Book of Odes and the
Carmen Saeculare after this; so that he
says of himself (Epp. ii. 1. 111) :—

“Ipse ego qui nullos me affirmo sm-ibere
Inss'fflgff Parthis mendacior.”

⁴ Ludicra’ means the follies of light poen-y,

jokes, amours, &c., as he says (Epp. ii. 2. .

55) :—

⁴⁸ Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes,
Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum;
Tendunt exto-rquere poemata.”

13. quo lare tutem] This is equivalent
to ⁴ qua in domo,’ respecting which see C.
i. 29. 14, n.; and as to ‘jurare in verba‚’
see note on Epod. xv. 4, “ in verba jurabas
mea.” The metaphor is taken from the
oath of the gladiator (⁴aucmramentum')
referred to above (S. ii. 7. 59). Horace
says he follows no school and knows no
master, but like a traveller always changing
his abode, he follows the breeze that carries
him hither and thither, just as his temper
happens to be or his judgm
be influenced3 “tossed to and fro, and
carried about with every wind of ‹loen-ine?
as St. Paul says, using the same sort of
language.

16. Nunc aqilis fio] That is, he agrees
with the Stoics, with whom ⁴⁸ the end of life
lay in its most active development,” and
whose ‘⁴ doctrine necessarily set itself in
direct opposition to all such modes of view
as made good to oonsist, not in activity, but
in calm enjoyment. They regarded the
pleasure that is sought to be derived from
an abandonment of active duties as a hind-
rance of life and an evi1’' (Ritter, Anc. Phil.
vol. iii. p. 563, Engl. Trans.). The virtue

‘Ilia ducere' is here to become· '.

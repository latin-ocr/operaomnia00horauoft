let him be nnturnl und mnnly3 the pssm'onate, high spirited 3—this is the way ιο make
friends md to keep them. But we do< just the reverse, turning virtues into'defects.
An honestmanisndrivellerz the slowandsureisuh033theprudentand cautious, a
liar and ι ἰοῖς the nnsophisticuted, a fool.

What ruham thus ιο establish a rule which must reuct upon ourselves. All have their
‘stultu he is beet who has feweet. Let my friend weigh my good with my bad, and 1
will do the same by him. If he would not have his great deformities offend my eye,
let him leurn to overlook my little ones: who would have indulgence must show it.

In short, since the desects of fools, according to your Stoic theory, cannot be got rid of,
it is reasonable we should jndge others as we judge ourselves, and visit euch fault with
no more thau its dne censure. The man who should hang his slave for euting the
remnants of his fish must be mad 3 but he is not less mad who for some trissing fault
hstes his friend. Because a friend breaks my old-fashioned dish. or helps himself
before me at table, am 1 ιο love him the less for that? What if he were to commit
thest, or embezzlement, οι· fraud? They who declare that all fnults are nlike, ure refuted
by common sense, experience, and expedieucy. Expediency is the parent of justice:
therefore men when they were in their first rude stete fought like beusts for their food3
but when they got civilized expediency taught them ιο make luws, which every one
must admit were frnmed to put down injustice. Nature cannot draw the distinction
between right und wrongg nor will my argument convince us that a petty thefl: is
ns had ns sacrilege. lat us visit euch fault then with its proper meed of punishmentg
thntis, letus not use the scourge where the whipis only dne3for1 heve no seur of
your reversing this and substituting the whip for the sconrge, though you do say you
would cut np sll vices alike if men would but make you king. ⁴

But ure you not a king? Is not the wiso man rich and handsome, a cobbler and a king?
Don't you hiow whst your founder Chrysippus ssid ἓ “ The wise nisu never mede him-
edfnshoeinhislife, yet is the wise manacobblerJ’ How is this? Why just ns
nemogenes is the best of singers, even when his lips are closed, and Altinius continued
tobeaclevershoemakerasterhehad changedhistradeand shntuphis shop3 evenso
the wise man is the best and only workmen, and a king. And yet thou king of kings,
thelitfle boys mob thee and pluck thy heard! To make a long story short: while
your kingship goes down ιο ιι cheep bath with no body-guard but Crispinus the block-
head, my friends shall make allowance for my fanlts, and Ι will make allowance for
theirs, und 1 shall live ns a subject more bloet than you or any other king.

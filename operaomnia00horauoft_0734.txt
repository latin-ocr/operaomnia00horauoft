HORATII FLACGI

Vicinas urbes alit et grave sentit aratrum,
Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis
Doctus iter melius, mortalia facta peribunt,
Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.

Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque

70

Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,
Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.
Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella
Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.

Versibus impariter junctis querimonia primum,

67. Seu cursum mutavit] The Scholiasts
say this refers to the draining of theVelabrum
(S. ii. 3. 229) by Agrippa. But Fea has
shown this to be an error. The Velabrum
was drained by Tarquinius Priscus, or who-
ever built the Cloaca Maxima (Livy i. 38),
and was occupied by considerable buildings
before the time of Augustus, among which
was the temple of Fortuna Virilis, built by
Lucullus. Suetonius tells us that Augustus
‘⁴ ad coercendas inundationes alveum Tiberis
laxavit, completum olim ruderibus et aedi·
ficiorum prolapsionibus coarctatum ” (c. 30).
To some such work as this Horace probably
refers, in language a little exaggerated.

68. Doctus iter melina] So it is said
of the river in Epp. i. 14. 29: “rivus si
decidit imber Multa mole docendus aprico
parcere prato.”

69. Nedum sermonum stet honos] This
construction Professor Key explains by
supposing the verb ¹ existumes ¹ understood
for the sake of brevity. (L. G. 1228.)

71. εἰ volet usum] See Epp. ii. 2. 119, 11.
Horace uses the words in the next verse
without reference to their technical distinc-
tion. The proper meaning of ‘ arbitrium,'
as distinguished from ‘ judicium,’ is given
in the Dictionary of Antiquities (art. ‘ J udex,’
p. 530, α.). ‘ Jus,' in one of its senses,
was a rule of law (Epp. i. 16. 41). ‘ Nor-
ma‚' a carpenter’s or mason’s square, also
described in the above Dictionary. The
deciding, ordering, and shaping of words
is all that Horace means.

75. Versibus impariter junctis queri-
monia] ‘ Impariter ’ is not used elsewhere.
What Horace here calls ‘ querimonia ’ is
ἐλεγεῖα &patrm-uc ἡ, ‘ mourning for the dead!
The oldest writer in this measure that has
come down to us is Callinus of Ephesus,

“ who appears to have lived during the greater

part of the seventh century 110. (See Miiller,
Lit. of Greece, p. 109.) His poetry, like that
of Tyrtaeus of Attica, was of a martial order.
Archilochus of Paros was nearly oontem-
porary with these. He too calls himself

Θεράπων Ἐνυαλίοιο ἄνακτος (Fr. l. Bergk).
He lost first his reputation (by running
away) and afterwards his life, in battle.
His elegiae verses were convivial as well as
warlike. He also wrote elegies for the dead.
Asius of Samos was contemporary with the
above, and these are no doubt the munst
writers in the elegiae metre. It was there·
fore of Ionian origin, whichever of these
poets first employed it. That question
which was not settled in Horaoe's day is
not likely to be settled now, ‘ et adhuc sub
judice lis est.' The next elegiae poet in
order of time was Mimnermus, also an γ
Ionian (concerning whom see Epp. i. 6. 663
ii. 2. 101, n.). His verses were chiefly of the
erotic order, which is referred to in v. 76.
The political and gnomic elegiae of Solon and
Theognis (some of whose poenis were oon-
vivial) come next, but Theognis more than
half a century later than Solon3 and oon-
temporary with him. or a little older, was
Xenophanes, the founder of the matie
school of philosophy, whose verses, m h
as we know, were of the symposiac oeder .
without being very eonducive to mii-th„
The great master of threnen'c poeti-y was
Simonides of Ceos, the contemporary and
rival of Aeschylus. “The elegy in thu
hands of different masters sometimes at-
tained a soster and more pathetic, md
sometimes a more manly and robust tone.
Nerei-theless there is no reason for‘dividiiag
the elegy into different kinds, such as the
military, political, symposiac, erotic, thre-
netic, and gnomic; inasmuch as some of
these characters are at times combined in
the same poem. Thus the elegy wasusunlly
sung at the symposium, and in most maes
its main subject is political, affer which it
assumes either an amatory, a plaintive,
or a sententious tone. At the same time
the elegy always retains its appropriate
character from which it never departs”
(Miiller, Lit. of Greece, p. 125). This
writer disputes the ordinary etymology of
the word elegy (ἓ ἓ λέγειν), though he takes

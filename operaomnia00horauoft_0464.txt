vius was we mnnot tell. It has been sup-
posed that it was the person to whom the
poem Culex, attributed to virgil, is ad-
dressed. Comm. Cruq. supposes August-us
to be meant. But after the death of the
dictator Octavius became C. Julius Caesar
Octavianus, and could not at this time be
called Octavius. On Fuscus (to whom the
epithet ⁸ optimus' belongs), see C. i. 22.
lut„ and S. 9. 61, and Epp. i. 10.

83. Viscorum laudet uterque l] Here
Acron writes, “Visci duo fratres erant
optimi poiitae. Alii dicunt criticos fuisse.
Pater eorum Vibius Viscus quamvis et
divitiis et amicitia Augusti clarus esset in
equestri tamen ordine perduravit.’' Comm.
Cruq. says much the same, and this is all
that can be said of them. If Viscus be
the correct reading in S. 9. 22. and S. ii. 8.
20. the persons there mentioned may be
one or other or both of these brothers.

85. tuo cum frutra] According to
Estre this was Gellius Poplicola, Messalla’ s
brother by adoption. He was with Brutus
and Cassius in Asia Minor; but left them
before the battle of Philippi, and joined M.
Antonius, aud commanded the right wing of
his army at Actium. (See Dion Cass.
xlvii. 24). If therefore this be the person
Horace alludes to, his acquaintance wcith
him began in Brutus’s camp. He was con-
sul in the year A.u.c. 718. Orelli adheres
to his notion (see note on v. 28) that
Messalla had a brother Q. Pedius Poplicola,
but he produces no evidence of the fact.

86. Vos, Bibule et Servi,] M. Calpur-
nius Bibulus, who was consul in A.u.c. 695,
and through the influence of Cn. Pompeius
was appointed governor of Syria in 703,
when Cicero was governor of Cilicia, had
four sons, of whom two were killed in
Egypt while their father was in Syria ; one
who was made governor of Syria by M.
Antonius, soon after the battle of Philippi
(at which he was present), and who appears
to have died in that province shortly after

he went thei-eg and one who was a little
child (παιδίον μικρόν, Ρ111ι. Brut. c. 13)
when his mother Porcia married Brutus,
which could not have been earlier than
A.u.c. 706, when the elder Bibulus died.

He must have been still quite young, which-
ever date of those that· are proposed is
adopted. In the Dice. Biog. this person 13
confounded with his third brother, aad in
said-to have been “quiteayouth” tt the
time of his motha-’s marriage. Plumeh's ⁷
words cannot be 30 understood.

In the notice of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,
the distinguished lawyer- and friend of Cicero,
in the Dict. Biog., it 13 said briefly that

great literary attainments, and Phil. ix. 3. 4,

Amuc 711,13 earnaetly dwelt upon). He
must have been older than norme, aud very
much older than Bibulus.

Furniuswasalsothestm ofaffiendmd
correspondent of Cicero, and was a Μαι-11173
with Augustus. The epithet ‘candidus'
applied to him by Horace show· thu: he
deserved esteem. Shortly aster the battle of
Actium he got Augustus to take his father,
who had followed M. Antonius, into favour,
and his gratitude on that occasion is recorded
by Seneca, de Benef. ii. 25. His words
show at least that he was no mean courtier:

“Hanc unam, Caesar, habeo injuriamfimuu
effecisti ut viverem et morerer in
Comm. Cruq. says of him,‘ ‘historiarumfide
et elegantia claruit.''

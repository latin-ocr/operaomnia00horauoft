18. dea-tro tempore] See below, S. 4. 4:
‘⁴ cum te sic tempore laevo Interpellarim.''

22. Pantolabum] S. i. 8. 101.

24. Milonius,] When the Scholiasta
know nothing about a man of this sort they
usually call him a ⁴ scurra,' a parasite, a low
fellow who has no respect for himself, who
lets himself out at the price of a dinner to
entertain rich people and their guests with
buffoonery and small talk. This man, as
soon as the wine gets into his head, would
get up and dance before the company, the
lowest proceeding in the eyes of a Roman
that could be imag-laed. Cicero (pro Mur.
c. 6) says it is wrong in Cato to eall a
Roman consul a ‘dancerz' “Nemo fere
saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit,'’ and he
calls it “omnium vitiorum postremum. '⁹
‘ Mox in this sense of ‘ wine-mck,' is ex-
pressive, but does not occur elsewhere. It
is 8 Greek notion. Juvenal graphically
describes the effect of tipsiness in doubling
the candles and putting every thing ont of
its place (vi. 304) :—

“Cum bibitur concha, cum jam vertigine
tectum .

Ambulat, et geminis exsurgit mensa lucer-

nis.’'

26. Castor qaudet equis,] Thisdifference
in the tastes of Castor and his brother is
expressed in one line of the Iliad (iii. 237),
Κάστορά θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν
Πολυδεύκεα. 011 what follows the Scho-
liasts quote the well known sentence of

Sequor hunc, Lucanus an Apulus anceps:

Terence, “ Quot homines tot sententiam
suus cuique mos ’³ (Phormio, ii. 4. 14).

28. claudere] See S. i. 10. 59. Out of
the common compliment in the next line
with which Rutgersius (Lact. Ven. p. 362)
compares Lucretius (iii. 1038) :—

“Lumina sis oculis etiam 11011118 Ancu’ re-
Ωἳέιὲἒέἐι· multis qnam tu fuit, improbe,
‚

the Scholiasts have extracted an allusion to
Lucilius’ ancestral connexion with Cn. Pom-
peius, whose uncle he is said to have
been. The description os anilins' affection
for his books, his companiona in chem-fnl-
noes and in aon-ow, to whom he communi-
cated as to sympathizing fn'ends his mont
secret thoughts, and through whom 1118
whole inner life was laid open to the world,
is graoeful and touching. It must have
satisfied any reasonable person who had
been disposed ω quan-el with Horace for
his remarks on the old poets.

33. Votiva—tabella] On tho practice
of hanging up a picture in the templea to
commemorate escape from shipwreck, seo
C. i. 5, 12, n. It was probably not con-
fined to sailors. Juvencius says, 1 do not
know on what authority, it was commonly
done by people 011 recovering from aicknass
or escaping from danger.

34. Vita senia] Lucilius, the date of
whose death is not certain, but who 18 said
to have died in his forty-sixth year, Anu-c.

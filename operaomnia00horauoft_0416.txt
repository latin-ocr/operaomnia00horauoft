Hic ego mendacem stultissimus usque puellam
Ad mediam noctem exspecto: somnus tamen aufert
Intentum veneri; tum immundo somnia visu

Nocturnam vestem maculant ventremque supinum.

Quattuor hinc rapimur viginti et milia rhedis,

reached Brundusium. Pratilli, supported
by Becker (Gallus, Sc. iv. n.) denies that
the northern road was called Via Appia,
which name, he says, belongs only to the
direct road through Venusia. But even that
he thinks doubtful, since Strabo confines
the name to that part of the road which lay
between Rome and Beneventum: τούν-
rebem δ’ ἤδη μέχρι τῆς Ῥώμης Ἀππία
καλεῖται (vi. 283. Cas.). Cramer says “the
little town of Trivico, which appears on a
height above the course of the ancient Ap-
pian way, points out the direction of that
road3 and some ruins, which are said to be
visible below it, probably represent the farm
which afforded a lodging to Horace and his
fellow travellersf' thanwhich latter con-
jecture nothing can be less probable in my
opinion.

81. camina] See Epod. ii. 43, ιι.

87. Mansuri oppidulo] It appears pro-
bable that the road on which Trivicum lay,
entering Apulia about ten miles from that
town, passed through or near the Apulian
Asculum (Asculi), and it is in that neigh-
bourhood that the little town with the un-
rhythmical name, at which the party stopped
after Trivicum, is now generally supposed
to have stood. Equus Tuticus is the place
fixed upon by the Scholiasts3 but that town
was nearer Beneventum than Trivicum, and,
by the shortest computation of the Itine-
raries, was sixty-three Roman miles from
Canusium, Horace’s next resting place. It
may be assumed that the town, which was
but a small one, aud inconvenient in his
time, has left no traces of its site; and of
its name we must be content to be ignorant.
It was not situated on the Appia Via, which
the cross road did not join till it reached
(Orelli says, Ι do not know on what autho-
rity or data) the place which in the Jerusa-

lem Itinerary is called ‘ ad Undecimum,'
being eleven miles from Canusium, and now,
he says, called Cerignola. It is equally pro-
bable, looking at the relative position of
Trivicum and Canusium, that the two reads
met near the left bank of the Aufidus.

89. ultra] This is the reading of all the
known MSS. Aldus (1501) first introduced
‘ultro ;’ aud a few editors,—H. Stephens,
Muretus, Baxter, and ethera—have adopted
it. Ι cannot understand why Orelli says
“⁴ ultro' rectum sensum non praebet,”
since ‘ ultro ’ signifies to a place further on,
and that is what Horace meana, namely‚ to
Canusium. I do not go against the MSS„
but ‘ ultro ' is the more word.

91. Nam Canusi Iapidoaeus,] In a plain
between the hills and the right bank of the
Aufidus (D’Anville incorrectly places it on
the left), about twelve miles from its mouth,
stood the town of Canusium (Canon). one
of the ancient Greek settlements of Apulis.
This town and others iu Apulia (Venusia
and Brundusium among them), and in other
parts of Eastern Italy, were repfflsentod to
have been founded by Diomed, when, aaa·
the Trojan war, he was driven on to the
coast of Apulia, and hospitably entertained
and presented with land by Daunu ita
king. His name was retained by the iahad·
now called Tremiti, but by the ancienoe
Diomedeae. By whomsoever founded, Ca-
nusium and Argyrippa or Arpi are stated by
Strabo (vi. 283. Cas.) to have-been the two
largest of the Greek citios ιιι Italy, and
ῗῖζέθῗζῖἒέἶῖῗάοὲιῗὲἒὲ ῗξᾶῗὲἱιῗιῗῗὶ
Canusium. Its grgatest splendour appear!
to have been realized in the time of Trajang
and for its wealth it suffered dreadfully
at the hands of the barban-iana, and after·
wards from the Saracena. Among the

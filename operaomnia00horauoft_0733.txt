Horace proybabl remembered very well the
vei-seaofSimonides (Fr-123,Bergk):

χαίρει τις Θεόδωρος ἐπεὶ Θάνιν· ἄλλος ἐπ’
χαιρῖἒεγιῗθανάτῳ πάντες ὀφειλόμεθα.

- receptu Terra Neptunus] The
‘lum Luoeinus’ was separated from the
hay of Baiae by a narrow causeway, the
consta-action of which tradition attributed
to Hercules
ἴυζ’ Prop. iii. 18;
mandat iter,'' Silius xii. 118). Beyond the

(“ Herculeo structa labore
¹⁴ Herculeum com-

” Luoeinus lay the Avernus lacus (lago

d'Averno), a basin without any outlet,
about a mile and a half in circumference,
md fed by streams from Mons Gaurus
(Monte Barbaro). The space between the
two lakes was covered with wood. In the
war with Sextus Pompeius, ΛΑΜ). 717,
Augustus, advised by Agrippa, to whom he
had entrusted the task of reforming his
fleet, opened a communication between the
lakes, and between lacus Avernus and the

v aea, whereby he made a harbour in which

he was able to practise his fleet. This be
called aster himself ‘ portus J alius! ‘⁶ Por-
tumJulium apud Baias immisso in Lucrinum
et Avernum lacum mari effecit. In quo
quum bieme tota copias exercuisset Pom-
peium inter Mylas et Naulochum supe-
ravit ” (Suet. Aug. 16). This is the work
virgil alludes to (Georg. ii. lon:

⁴⁴ Anfflrem portus Lucrinoque addita

Atque indignatum magnis stridoribus
J ulig‘iiigrponto longe sonat unda refuso,
T yxhgiluliusqyie fretis immittitur aestus

The basin of the Lucrine lake has been
filled up by the rising of a vclcanic hill
(Monte Nuovo), and is now a swamp.
Regis opus ’ (like ‘ regiae moles: C. ii. 15.
1) is a work worthy osa ' .

65. sterilisve diu palus] The MSS. and
editions vary between ⁴ que ’ and ¹ ve.’ But
Horace does not mean to couple a number
of illustr-atinus together, but to take any
one of them: whichever of these great
works you please to take decu-action surely
awaits it. How much more shall mere
words decay. The shortening of the last
syllable is a ⁴ licentia sumpta pudenter-,¹ and
not met with elsewhere. Quintilian (i. 7. 3)
remarks on the quantity of this word:
‘⁸ Palus aliud priore syllaba longa aliud se-
quenti significat; et cum eadem litera nomi-
nativo casu brevis ablativo longa ost, utrum
sequamur plerumque hac nota monendi
sumus.” There is not much in this, except
that it shows that later poets had followed
Horaoe’s licence. Bentley and others try
to mend the passage to get rid of this irre·
gularity, but they had better have lest it as
it stands. What work Horace here alludea
to is very doubtful. Comm· Cmq. says:
“ Pomptinas paludes Augustus exsiccnit et
habitabiles reddidit, injecto aggere lapidum
ac ten-aest Acron says the same: ‘⁴ Pom-
ptinam paludem siccavit ut ad mare meatum
habere cogeret ut post et arari posset?
That Julius Caesar contemplated such a
work we learn from Suetonius (Caes. 44),
and Plutarch (Caes. 58). That Augustus
may have contemplated it likewise‚ and
made the canal mentioned on S. i. 5. 7,
while that design was in his mind, is -
sible. The canal extended from Forum
Appii to Terracina, which is said to have
been the length of the marshes at that time.
Horace appears to be speculating upon a
work which, though often attempted, has
never succeeded. g1²'or a history of these

attempta see Penny Cyclopaedia (art.
‘Pomtine marshes '.)

LIBER, 2. 275

Qua muneretur te, Priape, et te, pater

Silvane, tutor finium !

Libet jacere modo sub antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.

Labuntur altis interim ripis aquae,

Queruntur in silvis aves,

Somnos quod invitet leves.
At cum tonantis annus hibernus J ovis

22. Silvae, tutor finium Ι] Silvanus
here only is alled the protector of bound-
nries, which province belonged to the god
Terminus. Virgil calls him the god of eorn-
fields sud cattle (Aen.viii. 6⁰1). See Diet.
Myth. ‘ Silvanus!

24. tenaci] This is merely a redundant
epithet. Grass, especially short turs grass,
which is here meent, binds the soil aud
tenaciously adheroe to it, both of which

31. Aut trudit aeres] There· is a de-
scriptiou in a simile of Statius (Adam. i.
459, sqq.) οἱ this way of huntiug wild basts.
The hunters encom some large space
(generally the foot of a wooded hill) with
strong nets, which they gradually drew into
ο more and more nan-ow circle, while dogs
and beaters with torches were set to drive
the beests into a given spot, where they
were attached and slain3 or else they were
driven down to the nets with which they
were entangled or stopped, unless they con-
trived, as they sometimes did, to break
through them, which would give occasion
for a chase in the open plain (See C. ἰ. l.
28). Statius sayS, in illustration of the
guthering of the Greeks at Aulis on their

expedition against Troy,—

 

Sic curva feras indago latentes
Claudit et admotis paullatim cassibus arctat.

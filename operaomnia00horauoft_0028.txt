xxii INTRODUC'TION.

O. i. 3.-—This is another of the Asclepiadean „meti-es, consisting of

two verses alternating thus :

--Ι-υυῙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υῦ

The first of these verses is called after Glycon, a poet whose age and
birthplace are unknown. The second verse is the same as C. i. 1. To
this metre also belong O. i. 13. 19. 36; iii. 9. 15. 19. 24. 25. 28; iv.

i. 3.

G. i. 4.—This metre has its name from Archilochus of Paros. It
consists of alternate verseS‚ of which the first is one of those that the
grammarians call ἁσυινᾶρτητοι ⁸, because they consist of different mensures
which do not blend together. The first four feet are those of an hexa-
meter verse, after which follow three trochees, the first part being

always distinct from the second. The second is a catalectic iambic t1·i-·

meter, that is, it has one syllable wanting 1n the last foot. There ιε no
other Ode m this metre.

O. i. 5.—This is also reckoned with the Asclepiadem metres, thou'gh
only the two first lines have their name from Asclepiades, being the

same as O. 1. The third is called after Pherecrates, the comic poet of ·

Athens. It consists of a dactyl between two spondees, if my ear does

not deceive me3 but it is usual to mark it with a spondee, choriambus, ’

and long syllable. The fourth is the Glyconean verse, which occurs in·
G. 3. To this metre belong O. i. 14, 21, 233 iii. 7, 13; iv.113.

and perhaps in the line of Horace:
‘ Quindecim Diana preces virorum!

If Horace has generally avoided this form of the verse, the dislike seems tolme boen
diminished as his ear improved3 so that while there is but one instance of such ι αω-
sura in the second book of the Carmina, and not one iu the third, there are no less then
twenty-two in the fourth, and in the Carm. Sec. one on an average in every stanna.
Nay, even iu such lines as ⁴ Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae ' we prefer the double
trochee nocent at the commencement to that which Dr. Carey considers so sweet, who
virtually makes ‘ chorus ' a trochee, and would, we suppose, give the sound of ρ, dactyl to
Romulae in ‘ Romulae genti date remque prolem Ι que Et decus omne! If any one will
read over the C. S. with the accent we contend for, he will readily perceive the bmuty of
the metre, and cease to wonder that Sappho and Catullus hesitated not tn make the fourth
syllable short. In particular much beauty will be added to the line ‘ Jam rides et Pax
et Honos Pudorque! According to Dr. Carey’s notion of a metrical aceent, ⁴ Pax’ will
lose all emphasis.”

⁸ πρῶτος ἀσυναρτὴτοις Ἀρχίλοχος κὲεχρηται (Hephaestion, p. 48, ap. Bentley ou
Epod. ii.>. The Scholiast on Hephaestion, p. 52, says there were no less than sixty-
four metres of this sort used by the Greeks.

time agreedupo ιι between the plaiutiff and
himas. Ifupo he did notap ap,pear he forfeited
the amount of the‘ vadimoninm’ oi· agree-

mgmhn‘Moe'vereiiabie to payit
if he did not. (SeeS.9,n.). The per-

son here represented, therefore, is the de-
fendant in an action going up reluctantly
to Rome, ’to appear before the Praetor
accurdingto hisagreement. ‘Ille’is asif
the man were before us.

14. Dela-mire valent] Though ‘ delasso'
does not occur elsewhere, there is no reason
to suspect the word or alter it. The in-
tensive force of ⁶ de ' is well added to
‘iassol It corresponds to κατά, which has
the seme force. By making ‘sdeo sunt
multa’ parenthetical, the construction is
plain. who Fabius was, it is impossible
even to conjecture with probability. Aci-on
saysot'him that hewae s Roman ‘eques' of
Narbo, who wrote some books on the Stoic
philosophy; thst lie was of Pompeius'
party, and thst he osten disputed with
Horace, whence he cells him ⁴ loquax ς’
which looks very like an invention derived
from the text. Porphyrion and Cruquius’

praetorata

Commentator both tell the same story,
and the former gives him the cognomen
Maximus. Supposing him to be the
Fabius we meet with below (2. 134), all
.. the additional knowledge we get of him is,
thathewasa manofloose character, and
one of the Scholiasts (Comm. Cruq. ) there
cans him a ‘jurisconsultus‚' -— probably m·

vented, Patre say s, from the word‘ judioess

though uo two wyords could be much more
different in meaning. But there is nothing

15. 8ἱᾳιιίεὒοω,] ThisisnotaRoman

way of speaking, but Greek, εἰ δαίμων τις.

‘Enego' does not belong to‘ funiamx but
is absolute: ‘Here am 1.’ ‘Eia' is an
exclamation of haste, ‘Awayl’ ‘Nonne’

they would not’ (οὐκ ἐθέλοιεν ἄν), is the
apodosisto‘ sioquisDeus! eompares. ii.
7. 24: “Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat,
usque recuses. ” A small number of MSS.
and editions have‘ nolunt,' which' is clearly
wrong. ‘Atqui’ is another form οἱ· at-
quin, ’and quin’ represents‘ qni, 'with a
negative particle affixed.

21. Iratus buccae mflet] An obvious
bnt not very reverential representation of
passion. Heindorf quotes Dem. de F. 1..
p. 442. διὰ τῆς ἀγορᾶς πορεύεται empci-
τιον καθεὶς ἀχρὶ ’νῦν σφυρῦν, ἶσα βαίνων
Πυθόκλει, τὰς γνάθους φυσῶν.

27. Sed tamen amoto] ‘Sed‚’ ‘ sed ta-
men,’ ‘veruntamen' are osten used, and
especially by Cicero, not to express opposi-
tion but after a parenthesis or digression,
as here and C. iv. 4. 22. See for another
instance among many, Cic. in Verr. (ii. 3.
2): “ Atque ego plus oneris habeo quam qui
ceteros accusarunt (si id onus
quod cum laetitia feras et voluptate) voeun-
tsmen hoc ego mplius suscepi quam ce.

23. Ille ,qr-avem] The cause of that dis·
content which was spoken of at the begin-
ning is here traced to the love of money,
each man thinking that liis neighbour is
getting it faster than he is, and wishing
therefore to change places with him. But

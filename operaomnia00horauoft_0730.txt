his will?

If you rescue him he will not become more rational!

HORATII FLAGGI

For what crime he is

suffered to make verses no one can tell3 but that he is as mad as a oeged bear there is
no doubt: he puts men to flight in all directions with his verses; or if he mtehes one
poor wretch he clings to him like a leech till he has killed him.

HUMANo capiti cervicem pictor equinam

Jungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas

Undique collatis membris, ut turpiter atrum

Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne,

Spectatum admissi risum teneatis, amici? 5
Credite, Pisones, isti tabulae fore librum

Persimilem cujus, velut aegri somnia, vanae

Fingentur species, ut nec pes nec caput uni

Reddatur formae.

Pictor-ibus atque poetis
Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.

Scimus et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim;
Sed non ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut

Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.

Inceptis gravibus plerumque et magna professis

Purpureus, late qui splendeat, unus et alter

Adsuitur pannus, cum lucus et ara Dianae
Et properantis aquae per amoenos ambitus agros,
Aut flumen Rhenum aut pluvius describitur arcus;

Sed nunc non erat his locus.

1. Humano capiti] The picture sup-
posed is monstrous enough3 a woman's
head and a fish’s tail, with a horse’s neck,
limbs from all manner of beasts, and feathers
from all sorts of birds. This portentous
medley (invented of course by himself, for
we are not bound to suppose he had ever
seen a pictorial monster of this kind),
Horace considered a good illustration of
some of the poetry of his day, in which
figures and images were throwu together
without order or purpose.

9. Pictor-ibus atque poetis] This is a
supposed reply, that painters and poets have
always been privileged people, which Ho-
race admits, but within certain limits. They
must not outrage common sense, nor should
they patch their verses with images which,
however pretty, have nothing to do with
the matter in hand.

18. flumen Rhenum] This is the same
form as “Metaurum flumen” (C. iv. 4. 38).

19. sortasse cupressum Scis simulare .·]

Et fortasse cupressum
Scis simulare : quid hoc, si fractis enatat exspes
Navibus aere dato qui pingitur?

Amphora coepit 20

The Scholiasts all agree in saying this re-
fers to a Greek proverb, μή τι καὶ κυπα-
ρίσσου θέλειςς t-he origin of which was an
answer given by a bad pointel· to a ship-
wrecked sailor, who asked him for a picmre
of his wreck (see C. i. 5. 12, n.). The man
considered himself clever at drawing a cy-
press, and asked the snilor if he should in-
troduce him one in his picture. .

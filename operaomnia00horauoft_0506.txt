with two farms, according to the standard of
incomes in the old times. This is Acron's
interpretation, which Heindorf approves.
As to the form ‘ divisse,' see S. l. 5. 79.

171. talea—nucesque] The ‘ talus ' was
the knuckle-bone of some animal, generally
a sheep, the Greek name for which was
ἀστράγαλος. The manner of playing with
it was the same among the Greeks and the
Romans, and the same bones are still used
by boys in England. The ancients used
them in games of skill and of chance; for
the latter purpose they were marked as
dice, and thrown usually from a box called
‘ fritillus,' ⁴ phimus,’ διο. (800 S. ii. 7. 17, n.,
and Becker's Gallus, on the ‘ Social Games,'
and Dict. Ant.). Boys had also games
of various kinds with nuts, as they have
now. Suetonius relates that Augustus
“animi laxandi causa modo piscabatur hamo,
modo talis aut ocellatis nucibusque ludebat
cum pueris minutis” (Octav. 83), where,
according to Foroellini, ⁴ ocellatis' means
small round stenes like eyes. But the
reading seems ιο 110 uncertain. Oppidius
observed that his son Aulus carried about
his bones and his nuts in a careless way in
a loose fold of his toga, ready to give them
away to any of his companions or to lose
them at play ς while Tiberius always counted
his oerefully and hid them away, carrying a
serious face wherever he went3 and from
these early signs of character he foresaw
that one would prove a spendthrift and the
other a miser. As to Nomentanus 800
S. i. 1. 102, n.; and on Cicuta see above,
v. 68.

178. coercet] Keeps within bounds,
defines, limite.

as a witness before a magistrate, and so
lost virtually much of his capacity for
private rights, which was not a consequence
of ordinary ‘infamia.' (See Dice. Aut,
art. ‘Infamia.’) He was also, 1101011101κοοι-
says (ap. Heindorf), incapable of the right
of ‘ mancipatio,’ and incapable of all pro-
ceedings ‘per aes et libram,' because in
such proceedings witnesses were wanted.
He was not able to witness a will, or,
according ιο Cruquius' Scholiast, ιο make
a will, or ιο receive any thing by will.
The conventional meaning of ‘ intestabilis ’
came to be the same as ‘detestabilis,' but
we may take the legal sense here. A- to
‘ sacer' Festus (quoted by Heindorf) say-t
‘⁴ Homo sacer is est quem populus judie-vit
ob maleficium, neque nefasest eum immolari,
sed qui occidit parricidii non damnatur, 110111
lege tribunicia prima cavetur, ⁴ Si quis eum

if they should ever aspire so high 08 ιο use
office of 011 aedile or a praetor. Wieland
and others suppose the magistracies of their
own town to be meant. Heindorf seems
ιο 110 right in opposing this view.

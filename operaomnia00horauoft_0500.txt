HORATII FLAOCI

Cum rapies in jus malis ridentem alienis,
Fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum et cum volet arbor.
Si male rem gerere insani est, contra bene sani,

Putidius multo cerebrum est mihi crede, Perilli,

Dictantis quod tu nunquam rescribere possis.
Audire atque togam jubeo componere, quisquis
Ambitione mala aut argenti pallet amore,
Quisquis luxuria tristive superstitione

Aut alio mentis morbo calet ; huc propius me,

Dum doceo insanire omnes, vos ordine adite.
Danda est eHebori multo pars maxima avaris;
Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.

put σι’] all kinds of characters, tell all
manner of lies, get out ot the obligation,
and laugh at his creditor, let him do what
he will to bind him. The reading ‘ in jura‚’
which appears in a great many MSS„ and
in most of the old editions, has no meaning.
It arose from a misunderstanding of the
passage, in which ‘ malis alienis ' was sup-

posed to mean another person's misfortunes.

Compare Valerius Flac. (Argon. viii. 163),

‘⁴ Errantesque genae atque alieno gaudia
vultu Semper erant.'’

74. Si male rem perere] See v. 40, ιι.

75. Ραίίᾱίιιε] This Forcellini explains,
I believe correctly, “insanius et quasi cor-
ruptius.’' Perillius is supposed to be the
‘ Cicuta' mentioned above, v. 69, but see
note. As ‘scribere' signifies to make an
entry, ‘rescribere’ signifies to cancel the
entry, which would be done when the debt
was paid and not before. ‘Quod tu nun-
quam rescribere possis ' therefore means
‘ what you can never reoover.' ‘ Dictare ’ is
to dictate the form of bond for the bor-
rower to write out or the sum to be entered
in his own books, and either way is equi-
valent to lending money.

77. togam jubeo componere,] This only
means to sit down and composedly attend
to what he is going to say. He turns from
Damasippus to au imaginary mixed audience.

78. pallet] Persius uses this word pro-
bably ιιι imitation of Horace (iv. 47),ι ‘Viso
si palles, improbe, nummo!

83. Nescio an Anticyram] On the
phrases‘ nescio an,' ‘haud scio an,' ‘I ιιι-
cline to think it is so, 'see K'ey’ s L. G. 1421.
Anticyra, called by Strabo Ἀντὶκιρῤα, was
a town of Phocis οιι the Sinus Corinthiacus,

and was celebrated for the productim of
hellebore, a medicine used very generally in
cases of madnoes. It would seem probable
from ver. 166 and other places that patients
went to reside at Anticyra sometimes. The
modern name is Aspra Spitia, that is, ‘hos-
pitia' There were two other places of the
name (Strabo, pp. 418. 434), one in Thes-
salysanother in Locris, each of which is
said to have produced hellebore. Whether
this ean be supported by A. P. 30⁰, Si
imbus Anticyris caput insanabile nun quam!
is more thau doubtful (see ιι. ). ⁶Destinare,’
Orelli says, is a medical term for pre-
scribing

84. ngStaberi] There is no information
about this person in the Scholiasta. 'rho
praenomen of Arrius was Qninmspelow, ’
ver. 243st ‘Quintip progenies Arri pn nobile

Verres wanted to suoceed him (in Verr. ii.
2. 15), being a person οἱ like mind with
himself, and of the lowest origin. See

that he gave a great funeral entertain-

speech in Vatinium, c. 12, 13. He there
calls him “familiaris meus,” which raiaco
a doubt whether he is the person men-
tioned in the Brutus. But it is not con-
clusive. He was dead when that treatise
was written. Orelli mlls him ‘famosum'

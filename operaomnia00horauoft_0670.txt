HORATII FLAOGI

Zethi dissiluit, donec suspecta severo

Conticuit lyra.

Fraternis cessisse putatur

Moribus Amphion: tu cede potentis amici

Lenibus imperiis, quotiesque educet in agros

45

Aetolis onerata plagis jumenta canesque,
Surge et inhumanae senium depone Camenae,
Goenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta3
Romanis sollemne viris opus, utile famae

Vitaeque et membris, praesertim cum valeas et

50

Vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum

Possis.

Adde virilia quod speciosius arma

Non est qui tractet: scis, quo clamore coronae
Proelia sustineas campestria ; denique saevam

Militiam puer et Cantabrica bella tulisti

Sub duce qui templis Parthorum signa refigit
Nunc, et si quid abest Italis adjudicat armis.
Ac, ne te retrahas et inexcusabilis absis,

brothers, the sons of Antiope by Zeus,
were different in their dispositions, the one
being given to music, and the other to
country pursuits. Euripides and Pacuvius
each wrote a play called Antiope, the former
of which is referred to by Plato (Gorgias,
p. 485) in connexion with a dispute of
these brothers. Zethus it appears had a
contempt for Amphion’s lyre, and advised
him roughly 10 throw it away, and take to
arms, and to useful pursuits, like his own.
Cicero alludes to Pacuvius’ play (de Orat.
ii. 37): “Miror cur philosophiae sicut
Zethus ille Pacuvianus bellum indixerim.’'
Propertius contrasts the brothers as “du-
rum Zethum 61 lacrimis Amphiona mol-
lem¹' (iii. 15. 3l); and the Scholiast on
Hesiod (Theogonis 60) says, Ἀμφίων καὶ
Ζῆθος αδελφοὶ μὲν ἦσαν, έτερόζηλοι δὲ
γεγόνασι ταῖς προαίρεσι. 866 1116 frag-
ments of Euripides' play in Deindorf's
collection (Poet. Sc. Gr. p. 82, sqq.) for
further uotices of these brothers.

46. Aetolis onerata playis] See Epp.
i. 6. Aetolian toils are toils fit for Meleager,
the king of Aetolia, and the destroyer of
the Calydonian boar3 of whom, just re-
turned from the hunt, there is a picture 111
1116 Museo Borbonico, discovered at Pom-
peii in the house that bears the name of
Meleager. With ‘ seuium’ compare ‘ se-
nectus ¹ (Epod. xiii. 5).

48. pulmenta laboribus empta;] Com-
pare S. ii. 2. 20: “tu pulmentaria quaere
Sudando.” ⁴ Pulmentum ' originally signi-

fied any thing 681611 with ‘puls,' porridge
or gruel (a common dish with the early

Romans) to give it a flavour. It came ,

afterwards to signify any savoury dish.

54. Proelia sustineas campestria ,·] Com-
pare A. P. 379: ‘⁴ Ludere qui nescit cam-
pestribus abstinet armis.” Τ116 allusion of
course is to the games on 1116 Campus
Martius.

55. Cantabrica bella] See Introduc-
tion, and C. ii. 6, lut. ; 111. 6, 1111.; 111. 8.
Α5 to ¹ Parthorum signa' see Epp. 12. 27.
Τ116 following line 15 merely a fiam-ish of
flattery like this about the standards. Au-
gustus had no intention of extending the
Roman empire at this time, and had 110
occasion to do so if the Parthians were
humbled, which they were not. No further
conquest was attempted till A.u.c. 739,
when some of the Alpine tribes were beaten
by Drusus and Tiberius, and their country
made into a province. (See C. iv. 4, Iut.)
The great majority of MSS. have 'refigit’
(v. 56). But all the old editions till Cru-
quius had ‘ refixit‚’ which is also supported
by MS. authority. Bentley defends ‘re- ¹
figit,’ and it appears in most modern texts.
The present tense is relied upon for fixing
the date of the Epistle. 866 Introduction.

58. Ac, ne te retrahas] Horace adds
another reason why he should not refuse to
join the amusements of his patron, that 116
cannot say he has no turn for that sort
of thing, for he is wont 10 amuse himself at
home with such spor-ts as sham fights,

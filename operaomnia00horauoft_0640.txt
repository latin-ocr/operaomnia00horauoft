HORATII FLACOI

Cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri

Nil parvum sapias et adhuc sublimia cures:

is

Quae mare compescant causae, quid temperet annum,
Stellae sponte sua jussaene vagentur et errent,

Quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat orbem,
Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors,

Empedocles an Stertinium deliret acumen. .

Verum seu pisces seu porrum et caepe trucidas
Utere Pompeio Grospho, et si quid petet ultro

14. Cum tu inter scabiem] There is no
reflection on Iccius in these words. His
occupation as a collector of rents and over-
seer of a large estate would bring a good

deal of dirty work upon his hands, and the '

words are well suited to express the con-
trast between the necessary pursuits of his
daily life and the high subjeets his mind
rose to in spite of such drawbacks.

16. Quae mare compescant caueam]
There is much poetical power in these four
verses. They are worthy of Lucretius, and
in his style.

20. Empedocles an Stertinium] Em-
pedocles was born about B.c. 520, and was
a man of wealth and station at Agrigentum
in Sicily. His philosophy was chiefly his
own; but in respect to his physics, which
are here more particularly referred to, he
seems to have held with the Eleatic school
of Xenophanes and Parmenides. What we
know of his doctrines is chiefly derived from
fragments of two poems in hexameter verse,
one called καθαρμοί, 8 song of expiatioti
(see Miiller’s Hist. Gr. Lit. p. 254); the
other on Nature, unless, which is most
probable, they are parts of the same poem.
vHis views are rendered more difficult of
oomprehension by the pretension, which
runs through his works and mystifies his
style, to divine powers. (See A. P. 463,
sqq.) Lucretius (i. 732, sqq.) says of his
poems (of which, so far as the fragments
allow, an analysis is given by Ritter, Hist.
Phil. i. p. 445, sqq.):

‘⁴ Carmina quinetiam divini pectoris ejus
Vociferantur, et exponunt praeclara re-
Ut Rviiiitlhiimana videatur stirpe creatus!

They were much read and admired by the
Romans. Horace refers perhaps to a
dogma 'imputed to Empedocles (Diog.
Laert. viii. 76). στοιχεῖα μὲν εἶναι τέτταρα,
πῦρ, ὕδωρ, γῆν, ἀέρα, φιλ’ αν τε ᾖ συγκρί-
νεται καὶ νεῖκος p διακρίνει-αις and to this

Cicero alludes (de Amic. vii.) when he says
“Agrigentinum quidem doctum quendam
virum carminibus Graecis vaticinatum ferunt,
quae in rerum natura totoque mundo con-
starent quaeque moverentur, ea contrahere
amicitiam, dissipare discordiam.’'

Stertinius, of whom all that is known has
been told in the Introduction to S. ii. 3, is
put again as the representative of the Senia,
who in their physical theory followed Aris-
totle, and he appears to have had 8 απι-
tempt for Empedocles. ‘Stertinium' is an
adjective formed like¹ Sulpiciis’ in C. iv.
12. 18. ‘Stertinium acumen’ is an ex-
pression like‘ sententia Catonis' (S. i. 2.
22, ιι., and others quoted there, and ιί. 1.
72, n.), and ⁴ error Herculis ' in Propertius
(i. 20. 15): ‘⁶ Quae miser ignotis error per-2
pessus in oris Herculis.” ⁴ Deliret ' is used
perhaps by way of jocular allusion to the
Stoic theory noticed in S. ii. 3.

21. Verum eeu pisces] This is 'only a
ἓξὲξ, 1ᾙὲξῖΐὲἓῖ iglifflzftffiffi
the chief purpose of the E·p1s,t10 the inho-
duction of Grosphus. Murdering leeksand
onions is 8 humorous way of alluding to the
notion of Pythagoras mentioned· m S.‘ ιί. 6.
63, and the same is extended to fishes per-
haps, because Empedocles, who believed in
the metempsychosis, though in a different
a ἱεῖς xime... sesam τε
clared that he himself had once beeri a flsh,
among other things:
ἤδη γάρ ποτ’ ἐγὼ γενόμην κοῦρός τε κόρη

τε
θάμίνθος τ’ οἰωνός τε καὶ ἐξ ἁλὸς ἔμπυρος

ιχ υς.
We need not at any rate suppose that a con-
trast of luxurious and frugal fare is meant
in ‘ pisces ’ and ‘porrum et caepe) “ Seu
laute sive parce vivis ” is the explanation of
Comm. Cruq., which many commentatore
have followed.

above punge of Cicero. The great ma-
jority 3118 111 favour of Minuci; and it is

ω settle the question that the se-
cond syllable in Numicius is long, as we
have seen in the sixth Epistle. There was
a Porta Minutia leading out of Rome, the
site οἳ which 13 unknown3 but it is probable
11131 this roed led from tint gate, 31111 that
it was in the southern part of the city. Ι
110 1101 know upon what grounds Obbarius
affirms, with Orelli's a pproval, that it is
certain this road led through 1118 country of
uie Marsi and Samnites.

25. decem vitiis instructior] ⁴ Fur-
nished with ten times as many defects!

26. veluti pia mater] Like a fond
mother who wishes her child to be wiser
31111 better than herself, the patron advises

31.Eutrape1u⁸] Aristone defines εὐτρα-
πιλία as πεπαιδευμένη ύβρις, 3 refined
im enee (Β.1181.11.12). 11 appears
that for his wit this name was given to
Ρ. Volumnius, an eques, 31111 ffiend of

M. Antonius, to whom are addressed two
of Cicero’s letters (vii. 32, 33). See his
life in 1118 Diet. Biog., art. ⁸ Βοὴ-31181113]
From the way Horace writes he must have
been dead 31 11113 111118.

34. honestum Officium,] Orelli refers
to the 1331 Epistle (v. 21), “ Officium facio,''
31111 explains ‘honestum officium' by 1118
proper respect 11118 from the poor to the
rich, the client to his patron, getting up
early to attend his levee, and so forth. 1
do not agreewith him. I think it means
thecallsofduty,inabettersense. See
Epp. ii. 2. 67.

36. Thrax erit] See S. ii. 6. 44. Ho-
race says he will get into debt, and be
reduced to hire himself as a gladiator, or
drive a costermonger's back. ’ Ad imum '
13 1101 elsewhere used as ‘ad extremum,'
but it means ‘when he has gotto the lowest
point! As to ‘ nummos alienos: see Epp.
ii. 2. 12, 11.

peated in A. P. 435 ε

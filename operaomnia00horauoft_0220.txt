190 HORATII

FLAOCI

Qui Musas amat impares
Ternos ter cyathos attonitus petet

Vates; tres prohibet supra

1⁵

Rixarum metuens tangere Gratia

Nudis juncta sororibus.

Insanire juvat: cur Berecyntiae ⁴

Gessant flamina tibiae?

Cur pendet tacita fistula cum lyra ἓ

Parcentes ego dexteras

20

Odi: sparge rosas; audiat invidus
Dementem strepitum Lycus
Et vicina seni non habilis Lyco.

Spissa te nitidum coma,

Puro te similem, Telephe, Vespero

Tempestiva petit Rhode

Me lentus Glycerae torret amor meae.

18. Insanirejuvat:] This is arepetition
of C. ii. 7. 28: ‘⁴ Recepto dulce mihi furere
est amico.’' Berecyntus was a mountain in
Phrygia, where Semele was worshipped.
Compare Catullus (lxiv. 265), ‘⁴ Barbaraque
horribili stridebat tibia cantu,” where, ac-
cording to the common application of the
word, ⁴ barbara ' is equivalent to Phrygia or
Berecyntia. Euripides also (Bacchae, 127)
speaks of ἡδυβόᾳ Φρυγίων αὐλῶν πνεύματι.
Compare C. iv. 1. 22, sqq. :

“ lyraeque et Berecyntiae
Delectabere tibiae
Mixtis carminibus non sine fistula.”

The ‘ fistula’ corresponded nearly to the
Greek ¹ syrinx,’ and what we call the Pan-
dean pipe: the ⁶ tibia’ was a sort of fla-
geolet. For particulare of these instruments
see Smith’s Dict. Ant„ Articles Syrinx and
Tibia. 1 do not understand Orelli’s note

 

on ‘fistulae' “proprie μείω-πως h. l. nt
videtur unius calami auctioris soni.” winter
roses were cultivated at great trouble ud
expense.

24‘. non habilis Lyca]
the Blandinian MSS. had ‘ habili: and that
reading Rutgersius must have followed when
he interpreted ‘ vicina ’ thus: ‘⁶ quae intaoea
neque aliter quam vicina cum vicino cum
Lyco marito degit ;’' as Juvenal (vi. 509),

 

vivit tanquam vicina marito.
Hztzfipolo propior quod amieos conjugio

But ⁸ vicina Lyco ' is not necessarily his
wife. “ Quem Lycum quare ita in transitu
carpserit Horatius non apparet,” says Esne,
on the matter-of -faet principle. Lycus
need not be hurt. He was no more than
a name.

CARMEN XX.

There can be very little doubt that this ode is imitated from the Greek, though Dii.
lenbr. denies it, as he generally does. It represents in heroic language a contest between
Pyrrhus and a girl not named for the affections of the handsome Nearchus. The last two
stanzas furnish a striking groupe for a picture. The passion of the jealous girl, and tho
conscious pride of the beautiful boy, are happily painted. -

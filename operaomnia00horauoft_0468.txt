438 HORATII FLAGOI

ARGUMENT.

Some men think my satire too severe, others think it wants power. Tell me, Trebatius,
what am I to do?

Keep quiet.

What, not write at all?

That is my advice.

Well certainly it would be better; but Ι can get no rest.

Then go and swim the Tiber, or drink freely over night3 or, if you must wn‘te, write of
Caesar’s renown, and you will get your reward.

Good father, I have no strength for thatz the battle-field is not a fit theme for every one.

But you may write of his virtues and his fortitude, as Lucilius wrote of Scipio’s.

So I will when opportunity offers. But Caesar is only to be approached at the proper
time. Stroke him clumsily and like a spirited horse he kicks. ,

But how much better is this than to libel bnffoons and prodigals, and so make 811 enemy
of every body.

What am Ι to do? Every man has his taste, and mine is to string words together, as
Lucilius did. He trusted 811 his secret thoughts to his books: iu prosperity or adversity
he made them his friends3 so that there you see the man's life drawn out as in 8
picture. Him the humble poet of Venusia follows. But Ι attack no one without pro-
vocation : why should I? Ι desire peace, but woe to the man that rouses me. He'll
suffer for it, and find himself the talk of the town. And this is in the course of nature.
Every animal defends itself with its own proper weapons. Τ118 long and short of it is
I must write whether I am to die presently or in a quiet old age, rich or poor, at home
or an exile, whatever or wherever 1 may be.

Young man, I sear your life is not worth much: your great friends will freae you to
death. μ

Why, were Laelius and Scipio offended with Lucilius when he attacked all the great men
of his day, sparing none but the virtuous? Nay, they loved him and lived with him
most familiarly. Ι may be much beneath Lucilius in wealth and genius3 but 1 too
have illustrious friends, and if any one thinks to put his teeth into me he will find him-
self mistaken. Do you object to that, Trebatius?

No, 1 do not. But I must remind you that if any man write scurrilous verses against
another the law allows him a remedy.

Ι grant you, scurrilous· but what if they are good and proper verses, and the person

worthy to be exposed?
Why then the court will laugh at the joke, and you will come off scot free.

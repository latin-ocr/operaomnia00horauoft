Sinon est jurat bene solis esse maritis.

also called ⁴ adversus,' because it was oppo-
site the door, was the marriage-bed, which
was dedicated to the genii of the bride and
bridegroom. If the man married a second
time tgna bed was changed. See Prop. (iv.

Gellius (xvi. 9) quotoe fiom the compitalia
of Laberius:

“ Nunc tu lentus ωε nune tu susque deque
Magsfamilhs tua in lecto adverso sedec?

Virgil's line (Aen. vi. 603), ‘⁴ Lnoent geniali·
bua altis Aurea fulcra toria,” which ia
usually quoted in this place, does not refer
to the marriage-bed, but to banquets in ⁷
honour of the genii, such as the Romans
celebrated on their birthdays aad at other
timae. (See C. iii. 17. 14.) The bed was
a symbol of domestic love and peace, and
was placed where it was for a good omen.
Juvenal says (S. vi. 21): “Antiquam et
vetus est—sacri genium contemnere lecfi,’'
to describe the profligacy of mankind from
the age of gold downwards. Lucan de-
soeibae it as “gradibus acclivis eburnis”
(Phara. ii. 356). Roepecting the genii, see
below, Epp. i. 7. 94; ii. 2. 187.

few MSS. have ‘ ridoe: and those inferior.

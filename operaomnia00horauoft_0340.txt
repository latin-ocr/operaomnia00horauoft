310 HORATII

FLAGGI

Non feret assiduas potiori te dare noctes

Et quaeret iratus parem,

Nec semel offensae cedet constantia formae, 15

Si certus intrarit dolor.

Et tu, quicunque es felicior atque meo nunc

Superbus incedis malo,

Sis pecore et multa dives tellure licebit

Tibique Pactolus fluat,

20

Nec te Pythagorae fallant arcana renati,

Formaque vincas Nirea,

Eheu translatos alio maerebis amores:

Ast ego vicissim risero.

In the full description Tibullus (or the
pseudo· Tibullus) gives of his person& in
which there can be little doubt he followed

paintings as well as statues well known ιιι
his day, he says,—

“ Intonsi crines longa cervice fluebant,
Stillabat Syrio myrtea rore coma.''

(iii. 4. 27, sq.)

Hence the expression in the text is almost
proverbial, and Neaera’s vow is one of eter-
nal fidelity. Other allusions to Apollo’s
hair will be found in C. i. 21. 2, “ Intonsum
pueri dicite Cynthium ;'’ C. ιιι. 4. 62, “ Qui
’0ἳὲΨο &affers mmm
an .1v.. ,“ oeeqm o vis
amne crines.”

11. virtute] ‘ Virtus ' here signifies
moral courage‚ determination, and firmness.
See note on C. S. 58. The name Neaera is
formed from νείαιρα, which is used by
Homer, and is said to be an irregular com-
parative of νέος, so that Neaera siguifies
‘ the younger.'

14. parem] One who is his match,
equally loving and true.

15. Nec semel offensae] ‘ offensus’ is
here used as the object of dislike. Horace
says, ¹ His firmness shall not yield to the
charms of thy beauty when once he shall
have learnt to hate it, and when the pain
shall have entered and settled within him.'
Of this use of the passive participle ⁴ offen-
sus, ⁹ Forcellini gives several examples.
Bentley, admitting that ‘ offensus ’ may
have this meaning, nevertheless alters ‘of-
fensae ' into ‘ offensi ;’ for what reason, he
asks, had Horace to hate her beauty? The
obvious reason, that he had been cheated
by it into loving her. There is more in
Bentley' s note of the same kind. No man
was ever less qualified for a judge upon
delicate points of taste or touches of nature.
The passage he says has been corrupted by

the audacity and ignoranee of the copyist!
and the interpretem, “ meram hic caliginem
pro luce offuderunt. '' But before he
reaches the end of his note new light
breaks in upon him, and he will allow the
common reading to stand, if only it be
granted that ⁴ forma ⁹ signifiee figuratively
Neaera herself: “Ettum sententia ait. ‘nec
constantia mea cedet tibi, formosa Neaera,
semel mihi invisae! '' Any sensible person
will see-that he concedes the whole po'mt,
and that the ‘audacial ‘ignorantia’ and ‘ca-
ligo pro luce offusass are au οιι hisowu aide.
1 do not find any MS. authority for ‘in-
travit 3' the meaning therefore is that he hm
not yet learned to hate, and the wound has
not yet become fixed and incurable, but that
ifitoncedoesso, she will neck iu vain to
recover his affections. Α

17. Et tu‚] The reading of mont οἰῶ·
old editions is ‘ at ίῑιι,1 which Fae defends,
‘¹ at enim particula adversans.” But aa ‘ nt’
is not an adversative particle his deflenoe
falls to the ground. Either conjunctiora
would do, because neither of them is ad·
vei-sative, and an adversative particle would
beoutofplace. ‘Ettu’ is thereadingof
all the oldest known MSS„ and of Porphy-
rion and Comm. Cruq.

19. licebit] This use of the futurem„ ’

shows the truth of Forcellini’s remark, that
‘ licet' and some other words which are
called by the grammarians conjunctione are
in fact only verbs, after which ⁴ ut' is under-
stood. ‘ Licebit' is used below (S. ii. 2. ω),
and by Ovid (Trist. v. l4. 3), ‘Detrahat
auctori multum fortuna licebitst The Pac-
tolus in Lydia was not the only goldeu
stream of the ancients. The Tagus, Hebrus,
Po, and Ganges, all had the same reputo.
What the secret learning of Pythagoras was
is expraeaed in the epithet given him, ‘re-
nati.' His metempsychosis is referred ω in
C. i. 28. 1⁰. Asto Nireus,see C. ιιι. 2⁰. 15.

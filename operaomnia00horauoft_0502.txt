HORATII FLACOI

Uter est insanior horum ἓ

Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.
Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum,

Nec studio citharae nec Musae deditus ulli3

105

Si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela
Aversus mercaturis : delirus et amens

Undique dicatur merito.

Qui discrepat istis

Qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti

Compositis metuensque velut contingere sacrum?

110

Si quis ad ingentem frumenti semper acervum
Porrectus vigilet cum longo fuste, neque illinc
Audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,
Ac potius foliis parcus vescatur amaris;

Si positis intus Chii veterisque Falerni

115

Mille cadis—nihil est, tercentum milibus—acre

Potet acetum3 age, si et stramentis incubet, unde—
Octoginta annos natus, cui stragula vestis,

nothing for money, while he used it for the
purpose of sensual indulgence. The story
Horace mentions is derived with little vari·
ation from Diog. Laert. (ii. 77), τοῦ θερά-
ποντος ἐν ὀδῷ βαστάζοντος ἀργύριον καὶ
βαρυνομένου, ὥς φασιν οἱ περὶ τὸν Βίωνα
ἐν ταῖς διατριβαῖς, ἀπόχεε, ἔφη, τὸ πλέον
καὶ ὅσον δύνασαι βάσταζε. ὃεθἘΡΡ. i.

103. litem quod lite resolvit] Which
settles one doubtful point by raising an-
other. It supposes that the conduct of Aris-
tippus may by some be considered noble.

104. Si quis emat eimau-aa] Sir Henry
Halford relates an instance of lunacy which
illustrates thisz “ In another well-known
case which justified the Lord Chaneellor's
issuing a writ ⁶ de lunatim inquirendo,' the
insanity of the gentleman manifested itself
in appropriating every thing to himself and
parting with nothing. When strongly
urged to put on a clean shirt he would do
it, but it must be over the ditty one; nor
would he put off his shoes when he went ω
bed. He would agree to purchase any
thing that was to be sold, but he would not
pay for it. He was, in fact, brought up
from the King’s Bench prison, where he
had been committed for not paying for a
picture valued at 1500 pounds which he had
agreed to buy3 and in giving my opinion to
the jury I recommended them to go over
to his house in Portland-place, where they
would find 15‚0001. worth of property of
every description; this picture, musical
instrumente, clocks, baby-houses, and bau-

bles, all huddled in confusion together on
the floor of his dining-room. I need not
add that the jury found the gentleman in-
sane ” (Halford’s Essays, p. 63).

106. formas] Here this significa a shoe-
maker's lasts. It is used for moulds in which
castings are made, and would express any
shape or block on which any thing is made.

107. Aversus mercaturis :] Τὴθ poets
use the dative aster verbs, participles, and
adjectives, which signify removal or differ-
enoe. See Key’s 1.. G. 987. Compare
C. ii. 4. lv: ‘⁴ Tam lucro aversam.” ⁴ Istis ⁹
(v. 108) is the dative under the same rule.
Quintilian (vii. l. ll) has “ defensioni aver-
sior ;” and this Latin use accounts forem·
own ‘ averse to.'

115. Chii veterisque Falerni] Pliny says
respecting the age of Falernhn, ‘⁴ Falernum
nec in novitate nec in nimia vetustate cor-
pori salubre est. Media ejus aetas a quinto
decimo anno incipit '' (N. H. xxiii. 20).

116. nihil θεὴ] He might have said
⁴ immo.’ See S. i. 3. 20, n. A similar
mode of expression, as 1 understand the
line, occurs in Aeschylus (Eumen. 38)=

deicafa γὰρ γραῦς, οὐδὲν, ἀντίπαις μὲν
ουν.

117. unde· Octoqz’nta annos natum] Aster
he has completed seventy-nine years, that
is, in his eightieth year.

118. straqula vestim] ‘¹ In ⁴ stratum '
omne vestimentum contineri quod injiciatur
Labeo ait: neque enim dubium ost quin
stragula vestis sit omne pallium περίστρωμα.

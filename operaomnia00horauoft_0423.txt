Nos facere a volgo longe longeque remotos?
Namque esto populus Laevino mallet honorem

Quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret .

Appius ingenuo si non essem patre natus ι
Vel merito quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem.
Sed fulgente trahit constrictos Gloria curru

fitius, et sex fere annis possedit, et louge
longeque rem meliorem fecit.'' Τ1ιο repeti-
tion is only analogous, as Bentley says, to
many others in the Latin language, as
‘etiam atque· etiam,' ‘nimium nimiumquess
‘magis magisque: διο. After Cruq nius,
Bagter was the first to adopt· longe longe-
,'which Bentley edited soon afterwards,
ιιῗᾱ it is now the received reading.

19. Namque esto] He gooe on to show
that though the value set upon titles and
birth by the populace might be exsggerated,
yet the other extreme is not to be allowed;
and that he who seeks to push himself
beyond his aphere might be justly rebuked
for his presumption.

2⁰. Quam Decio mandare novo ,] P. De-
cius Mus, who devoted himself to death for
hia country at the battle of Vesuvius in the
Latin war, A.u.c. 414, was the first consul
of hia family. He held the office with
T. Manlius Torquatus in that y.ear Aster
the curule ω were opened to the

, an order of nobility sprung up
among themselves based upon the holding
of these offioes. Th0se fdmmilies of which
any member had ever held a curule office
were ⁸ nobiles,' the rest ⁶ ignobiles‚’ and he in
whose person such dignity was first attained
was called, originally no doubt through the
contempt of the patriciana, but afterwards
conventionally by all, ‘novus homo.' The
Deda gens was plebeian.

censorque moveret Appius] The Appius
who is here taken as the type of severe
censorship is Appius Claudius Caecus, the
constructor of the road and aqueduct that
bore his name. He was made Censor A.u.c.
442. Itwas the province of the Censors,
till that office was merged in the imperial
power, to supply vacancies in the senate from
the list of those who were eligible, who were
all citizens of at least equestrian rank, of
not less than a certain age (which we do
not know exactly, but it was between thirty
aud forty), and those persons who had
served in the principal magistracies. But
they could also, in revising the list of
senators at the beginning of their censor-
ship, degrada thooe who had previously
been* ιιι the senate, as well as exclude such

as by their official rank were entitled to be
senators. This they did at their own dis-
cretion for various offences by which ⁸ igno-
minia ² was liable to be incurred, or from the
senator having been chosen improperly.
They effectedg this exclusion merely by
marking the name, and their mark was
called‘ nota censoria? Horace, therefore,
means that if he, through the favour of
Maeoenas or other means, sought as a
freedman's son to reach the dignity of a
senator, and suoeeeded, the censors, if they
did their duty strictly, would degrade him.
The censor Appius however is notorious
for his laxity in having chosen for party
purposoe the sons of freedmen and other
unqualified people into the senate. But he
was harsh and arbitrary in the exercise of
his office, and his name was proverbial in
connexion with the censorship, which is
enough to account for his appearance here.
There was no money qualification for the
senate, but only one ot' rank. ‘Movere’
is the technical word for degrading a senator,
and those who were degraded or not ad-
mitted were called ‘praeteriti senatores'
from the circumstance of their being merely
passed by when the lists were made out,
and their names not appearing, which
would prevent them from acting. (See
Dict. Ant. ,arts. ‘,’Senams ‘,’Censores ‘nota
Censoria- ⁹) ‘In propria non pelle qui-
essem’ is the old story oftheass in the
lion’ s skin.

23. Sed fulyente trahit] This verse
may or may not be taken from some heroic
poem. It is introduced humorously, and
yet with a seriem meaning. ‘Let the
populace set their hearts upon rank and
daecent, and let the censors make that their
standard for the senate, yet the humbly
born may have their honours as well ;' that
is, the honours that arise from virtue and
genius. ΤΙιε picture of Glory monnted on
her car is repeated in Epp. ii. l. 177, where
the epithet ‘fulgente' is exchanged for

‘,'ventoso fickle as the winda) As observed
before (C. S. 57, ιι), ‘Gloria' appearsinthe
ancient descripfions' ιιι two characters, good

and bad. In the former she' is represented
by Honos.

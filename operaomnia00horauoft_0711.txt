broad and clear you cau thinkas you go along! Why there is every sort of obstruetion,
mtrem-s with their mules and porters, σηοω swinging stones and beams over
yourhead, fune-als, mad dogs, fflthy swine3 1 should like you to make verses iu such
a sesne as that. The poet loves retirement and the woods; the student who has
bem foryearaporingover his booksisrathoeawkwardintheworld; howeanl write
reses while the waves and storms of the city are maring about me ?

(v. 87.) Resides, these poeta do nothing but praise one another. ‘A wonderful work !
suxelyall the Muses had a haud in it!’ Howweholdup ourheadsandstrntpast

(v. 1⁰6.) Though the public may laugh at bd verses, their authors are well aatisfied. and
if you do not praise them they will praise themselves. But he who wants to write a
real poem, must act his own censor andcutoutwhatisbad,evenif hekeepsitstill
locked up at home. He will not fail to reproduee obsolete but expressive words as
wellasnew3hewill pouralong likearapidriver‚and enrich the land with the copious
suetan of his eloquence ;‚pruning‚ smoothing, erasing, the result will seem as easy as

(v. 126.) 1 had rather, says one, be looked upon as a fool, and be safisfied with my own
perfia-mances, than be ever so learned and tormented to boot. He is like the gentleman
at Argoa, who used to fancy himself sitting in the theatro and clapping the performers.
He wa perfectly sane inother mpoets, and when his friends recovered him from this
mia, he bitte-ly complained that they had taken away his pleasant illusion-

(ν. 140.) But, aster all, the best thing is to put away child's play and poetry, and take ιο
philosophy. Therefore 1 reason with myself thus z ⁴ If you had a fevcr in your veina
yon would speak to the physician. But if the more you have the more you want, will
you keep that ιο yourself? If you found a particular remedy did you no good, you
would avoid that remedy. Well, you heard men say that if a man had money he had
wisdomz but if yon find yourself no wiser now you are richer, will you stick to those
advisa-s? If wealth couldmakeamanwise andgood‚youwould be ashamedif any
were richer than yourself. lf what a man pays for is his own, and there are some
things which become ours by possession, then your neighbour's farm which supplies you
⁷ with all you want is yours. What does it matter whether you paid for it yaeterday or
longago? If amanbuysland,allhe getsfiomitisbought,thonghheeallsitallhis
own, and puts up boundaries to mark it off, as if that could be one's own which may
change hands in a moment. What is the use of villas and barus if heir sumetis
heir as wave suoeeeds wave? What are broad pasturoe to us if deathlays alllow
alike? As for jewels and all fine things, there are some who have, them not, bnt the
wise man carae not to have them. Why one man prefers his ease to the riches of
Herod, while his brother is slaving all day, their genius alone ean tell, the eompmou
of their birth, their life, and their death, never the same, now fair, now dark. Ι shall
use my small means as Ι please, without sear of what my heir may say; yet 1 am not
disposed to forget the difference between a cheerful liver and a profligate, a frugal man
and amiser. It isone thing to squander, another to spend it liberally, to seek no mox-e
than you want, and to enjoy like the school-boys the short holiday that is lest you.

have done my‘best to determine the date of each poem so far as
ἓ there ate reasonable grounds to argue upon. The principal autho-
, rifiefl on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
-ζ “ are Franke (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirchner (Quaes-
’ tiones Horatianae, Leipzic‚ 1834). These two writers differ mate-
riauy from one another, and both of them from Bentley, who in his
χ Preface has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the seve-
’ tal books, without stating the grounds on which he founds it. It
will bc seen that I prefer Franke's opinion on this subject to
γ’ Kirchner's, but that there are many instances in which his zeal
² appears to outstrip his judg-ment in determining the ‹12ae of par-
” ticular poems.

34 Of the other books that Ι have used Ι have been most indebted
to Estre' s Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most
, ,favourable specimen of industry and judgment.

ζ Ι have studied with much pleasure the fragments of the Greek ’
³} Lyric poets‚ with whose entire works Horace must have been
Γῑίζ ‚humiliat The little that is left may make us mourn for what is
lost. So much beauty has perished as the world will never see
ἒ again. There is more power of tendernaes and passionate feeling
,ᾗ in some of Sappho's small fragments than in all that Horace
³ ever wrote. Such passages of these poets as he appears to have
[ᾗ imitated, intentionally or otherwise, Ι have given, so far as they
” ² can be gathered from the fragments now remaining, the edition of
which by Bergk (Leipzic, 1843) is that which Ι have used. Most
ἱ of them had been quoted before.

 

s ³ This leads me to say that I have not loaded the notes with nearly
’ so many quotations as most who have gone before me. I have
‘fid to confine myself to such passages as throw light upon the
ν 4* text, or appear to have been imitated by or copied from Horace.

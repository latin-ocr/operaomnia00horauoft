490 HORATII FLAGGI

SATIRE IV.

This Satire is an essay on good living put in the form of precepts delivered to Horace
at second hand by one Catius, who professes to have got them from some sage more
learned in the art, but whom he does not name. Horace meets him accidentally as he is
hurrying away from the Pr0fessor’s lecture to think over what he had learnt, and to store
it in his mind. Catius recites what he has heard from memory or from notes, and
enters without preface upon the question of the first course. Tine Professor may be
supposed to have can-ied his hearers through an entire dinner, ‘⁴ ab ovo usque ad maist
(see S. i. 3. 6, n.). Catius only gives the heads of the lecture and one or two of the
sage’s reflections. The precepts he delivers inflame Horace with a desire to see and hear
the great man himself, and he prays Catius to introduce him. It may be that Horace had
some third person in his eye, but we have no means of knowing who it was. If it be so,
there were those no doubt who would understand the allusion at the time. That it was
Maecenas Heindorf supposes; Wieland that Horace meant himself: Acron says he mant
Nasidienus, but who Nasidienus was we do not know (S. 8. Introduction). Conjeoeure
is thrown away. As to the man Catius himself the Scholiasta can him M. cnam, ud
Comm. Cruq. (on ver. 47) Catius Miltiades. Cicero, writing to Cassius (ad Pam. xv. 16)
mentions one Catius Insuber, an Epicurean, who was lately dead, and for whom he ex-
presses some contempt, meant perhaps for the sect he belonged to more thau for himself.
Quintilian (x. l. 124) speaks of a Catius (probably the same as Cicero's) as “ in Epicureis
levis quidem sed non injucundus.” There was therefore in Cicero’s time a person of thia
name who was pretty well known, and who probably wrote on the opinions of his sect, the
Epicureans. The Scholiasts tell us that he wrote ‘⁶ quattuor libros de rerum natura et de
summo bono;'' and Comm. Cruq. on ver. 47 says Horace “ irridet eum quod de opere
pistorio in suo libro scribit de se ipso, Haec primus invenit et cognovit Catius MiltiadesJ’
He does not seem however to have observed that Catius is only representing the words
of his teacher. But m this person must have been dead many years betomthin Satine
was written (Cicero's letter was written A.u.c. 709), it has been supposed by some that
Horace introduces his name, though he was no longer living, only as a handle for ridi-
culing the Epicuream. Orelli suggests that Horace’s Catius was a freedman of Cioero'·
Catius, and a contemptible person, notorious as a writer on cookery. Certainly a well-
known name would answer every purpose even if the owner were dead, and the forme· of
these two opinions is probably correct.

That Horace chose a well-known Epicurean 'as the speaker in this gastronomical Satine,
seems to show that he no longer held with that sect when he wrote it (see C. i. δαίς S. i.
5. 101). That the followers of Epicurus went beyond their master in patronizing-oensml'
delights may very well be believed. It is usually the fate of unsound wachel-s, that
their errors are exaggerated by those who profess to adopt them. It appears that Epi-
curus held πολυτελῆ aina to be only secondary plasmas, οὐκ ἀναγκαίαςε that he held
a man should be able to do without them, though if he could afford them he would do well
to have them ; and indeed that he had a good opinion even of fasting (Diog. Laert. x. 127
—149). But his Roman adherents did not take that view of their duty, and under the
sanction of his name and school made good living the chief good, and the art of cookery
the art of life (see Introduction to S. 2 of this book).

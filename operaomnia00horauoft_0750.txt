HORATII FLA CCI

Laude; sed in vitium libertas excidit et vim
Dignam lege regi ; lex est accepta chorusque
Turpiter obticuit sublato jure nocendi.

Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae,

Nec minimum meruere decus vestigia Graeca
Ausi deserere et celebrare domestica facta,
Vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas.
Nec virtute foret clarisve potentius armis

Quam lingua Latium, si non offenderet unum
Quemque poetarum limae labor et mora.

the song of the revellers (κῶμος) at the
Dionysia;.or of the labours of Susarion,
who as early at least as Thespis, at Icaria,
a village in Attica, contended with a comic
chorus for a prize. That which was before

to it personal ribaldi-y and political jokes,
the former levelled at the spectators or
against public men. Between Susarion and
the period of the old comedy there were
several distinguished writers, as Chionides,
Magnes, Ecphantides, and others. The
earliest writer of the old comedy was Cra-
tinus. See S. i. 4. l, n, on this subject.
288. Vel qui praeteoetas] ⁴ Fabulae
praetextae ’ or ‘ praetextatae ’ were tragedies.
as ‘togatae ' were comedies, with plots con-
nected with Roman stories and manners,
(See Epp. ii. l. 57, sqq.) The Greektrm
gedies to which ‘'praetextae were opposed
were called by the Romans‘ crepidatae!
‘'Dooere is used as the Greeks used διδά-
σκειν for exhibiting a play, because the poet
also trained the chorus as χοροδιδάσκαλος,
The principal writers of tragedy and comedy
are mentioned in the above Epistle and
distinguished' in the notes. To the writers
of‘ togatae⁷ Acron here adds Aelius Lamia,
Antonius Rufus, Cn. Melissus Pomponius.
292. Pompilius sanquiffl The ⁴ Cal-
purnia genS,' to which the Pisones belonged,

claimed descent from Calpas, son of Numa
Pompilius.

294. ad unquem] See S. i. 5. 32, ιι.
'rho following
verses to 308 have little connexion, as far
as 1 can see, with whatgoae before. The
question about edua-tion and nature in
connexion with poetry is taken up again at
v. 408. We are accustomcd to snbscn'be
to the doctrine ‘⁴ poeta nasm'tur, ιισιι fit.¹’
The ancients were divided on that point,
some assigning more to'educutiom others to
natural gists. Cicero, speaking of Pacuvius,
asks, “ Pacuvium putatis in scribendo leni
animo ac remisso fuisse? Fieri nullo modo
potuit. Saepe enim audivi poetam bonnm
neminem (id quod a Democrito et Platone
in scriptis relictum esse dicunt) sine m-
flammatione animorum existere posse et
sine quodam afflatu qnasi furoris” (Pe
Orat. ii. 46). Again he says: “negat sinc
furore Democritus quemquam poetam mag-
num esse posse. quod idem dicit Phw’
(de Divin. i. 37).

300. Si tribue Anti cyr-u} There were
three places of this name, each of which is
assumed from this passage to have produced
hellebore, a very improbable coincidence.
Horace puts ‘tribus' as wc might say a
dozen or any other indefinite number.
(See S. ii. 3. 83.)

CARMINUM II. 6. 97

Beyond thia we know nothing? of Septimius, except that Cruquiua' Scholiast makes him
the same aa 'fitius in the epistle to Julius Florus (Epp. i. 3, v. 9, see note).

The date ofthia ode has been much discussed. Esneplaoesit verysoon aster Horaoe's
, first arrival at Rome, when he was froeh from the fatigues of war, which the expression
⁴ sit modus lasso maris et viarum Militiaeque’ seems to favour. But a young man just
retaining home to begin life does not begin by writing about a retreat for his declining
years. *There is a character about the ode which belongs to a later period. He must
lure been familiar with Tibur and Tarentum and other localities which he alludae to. The
allusion to the Cantabri in v. 2 is supposed by others to fix the date much later, namely,
in mmo. 729, when Augustus was engaged in reducing a rebellion in Spdn. At any time
before A.u.c. 725, when the Cantabri were first reduced, they could have been called by
Horace ¹ indoctos juga ferre nostra,’ even though no attempt had been made to impose
that yoko. In '125 they were reduced to subjection3 in 728 they broke out again, and in
the following year they were finally subdued, though an unimportant disturbanoe had to
be put down by Agrippa some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21 ; iv. 14. 41. Epp. i. 12.
26). If therefore the ode was written aster 725, it must have been in the beginning
of 729 or thereabouts, and I am inclined to think that was the date, though 1 admit the
difficulty of understanding why Horace should speak of himself even poetically as tired of
warfareand the eea, so manyyearaasterhe had ceasedtohave anything todowith
eithara 'rbat he does not speak of his Sabine farm, but gives the preference to Tibur
orTarentum, provee nothing. Long aster he had possession of his farm, he expresses
hia preference for those places (Epp. i. 7. 44) ι·-

- “ mihi jam uon regia Roma
Sed vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle Tarentum.”
(See also C. iii. 4. 21, sqq.) And that he frequented Tibur is well known. Some say
he owned, some he rented, a small property there. It may, however, be doubted after
au perhaps, whether Horace must be taken as speaking strictly of himself. He may' only
mean in effect, that the weary need seek no happie'r resting-place than Tibur or Tarentum,
ffiough he puts the matter in the form of a wish for himself. It was probably on or after
a visit to Septimius that Horace composed the twenty-eighth ode of the first book; and,
probably with the atti-actions of Tarentum fresh in his mind, he wrote this ode. But he
may have paid his friend many visits.
ARGUMENT.

Septimius, who art ready to go with me to the ends of the earth, I would that 1 might
end my days.at Tibur, or, if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Above all others Ι
love that spot, with its honey, its olives, its long spring, and mild winter, and grapoe
on Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together; and there thou shouldst
lay my bones and weep over them.

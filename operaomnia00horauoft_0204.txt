174 HORA'I'II FLAOGI

MISERARUM est neque amori dare ludum neque dulei
Mala vino lavere, aut exanimari metuentes
Patruae verbera linguae.
Tibi qualum Cythereae puer ales, tibi telas
Operosaeque Minervae studium aufert, Neobule, 5
Liparaei nitor Hebri,
Simul unctos Tiberinis humeros lavit m undis,
Eques' 1pso melior Bellerophonte, neque pugno
Neque segni pede victus ;
Catus idem per apertum fugientes agitato 10
Grege cervos jaculari et celer alto latitantem
Fruticeto excipere aprum.

birth-place is mentioned to give morer eality

was an odd place to choose.

CARMEN XIII.

The situation and title of the fountain, the name of which is‘used in this ode, ia suffl-
ciently proved by a bull of Pope Pascal 11., Am. 1103, first brought to notice by Cnpmnffl
de Chaupy in his work on Horace’s country-house (vol. iii. pp. 364. 538), md ῥιπαὶ mo
fully by Fea. 'lhere was a monastery dedicated to the Virgin at Bantia (C. iii. 4. 15).
over which the bull appoints a certain abbot, and over* ‘omnia quae ad illud (coenobium)
pertinent—videlieet eoelaeiam S. Salvatoris cum aliis ecclesiis de castello Banfflm'i, -eode-
siam S. Anastasiae apud Acheruntiam cum ecclesiis ad eam pertinentibus, eodee'un

dusia was the district in which Horace's farm was situated, aud some commentatore fol.

(Licenza) in the Sabine hille. This De Chaupy sufficiently diupi-oves. Lambinus adopt·
the Scholiast's statement as well ιι his way of spouing the name ‘ Blandusiae: which the
above-named document sufficiently pmvee to be wrong, though most editores hum
adopted it.

36 HORATH 'FLAOOI

GARMEN XIII.

The same remark applies to this ode as to many others, that those who believe it to
have reference to real persons, and the jealousy to be any thing but a poetical jealousy:
have mistaken the character of Horace's writings. It would be difficult to imagine the
man who wrote these verses really jealous while he was writing them, or much acquainted
with that passion. The ode is too slight for us to judge whether it was taken from a
Greek origina13 but the expression in v. 16 shows that Greek ideas were running in the
writer's head, which may be said, I feel satisfied, of almost every one of his amatory com-
positions. ’

ARGUMENT.

Lydia, while thou art praising Telephus’ neck, Telephus' arms, oh! my beart is ready to
burst. My mind tosses about, my colour comes and goes3 and the tear stealing down

my cheek tells of the slow fire that burns within. It galis me when his rough hands .

hurt thy shoulders, or his teeth leave their mark on thy lips: think not he will be ’

constant who could hnrt that nectared mouth. How happy they whom love biuda fast ⁷

to the day of their death!
CUM tu, Lydia, Telephi

Cei-vicem roseam, cerea Telephi
Laudas brachia vae meum
Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur.

Certa sede manet, humor et in genas
Furtim labitur, arguens
Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.

Rixae sive puer furens
Impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audias,
Speres perpetuum dulcia barbare

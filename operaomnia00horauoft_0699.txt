Militiae quamquam piger et malus, utilis urbi,

Si das hoc parvis quoque rebus magna juvari.

Os tenerum pueri balbumque poeta figurat,
Torquet ab obscoenis jam nunc sermonibus aurem,
Mox etiam pectus praeceptis format amicis,
Asperitatis et invidiae corrector et irae ;

Recte facta refert, orientia tempora notis

130

Instruit exemplis, inopem solatur et aegrum.
Castis cum pueris ignara puella mariti

Disceret unde preces vatem ni Musa dedisset?
Poscit opem chorus et praesentia numina sentit,

Caelestes implorat aquas docta prece blandus,

135

Avertit morbos, metuenda pericula pellit,
Impetrat et pacem et locupletem frugibus annum.
carmine di superi placantur, carmine Manes.
Agricolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati,

Condita post frumenta levantes tempore sesto
corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,

140

Cum sociis operum, pueris et conjuge fida,
Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,

127. J'aem nunc] See C. iii. 6. 23, 11.
As to ‘sermm' see C. iii. 24. 543 S. i. 4.
121. A. P. 307, and other places. For
‘ corrector,' 588 Epp. i. 15. 37. ⁴ Orientis
tempora ' seemsto 1118811 the time of youth,
as we say, the dawn of lise. Orelli says it
does not mean this, but each season of
life 85 it begins.

132. Castis cum pueris] Τ118 Carmen
Saeculare was sung by a choir, consisting
of twenty-seven boys, and as many girls, of
noble birth (see Introduction); and such
choruses were usual on special occasions of
that sort. The vestal virgins addressed
their prayers to their goddess ‘ docta prece,'
the equivalent for which is ⁶ carmine :’

“ — prece qua fatigent
Virgines sanctae minus audientem
Carmina Vestam?” (C. i. 2. 26)

where ⁴ prece ’ is opposed to ⁴ carmina,’

thoughthe latter too were prayers, and per-

haps in verse, but in a set form, ‘ doctae
³ preces!

138. carmine Manem] The great an-
nual festival at which the Manae, the souls
of the departed, were worshipped, was the
Lemuria, which was celebrated in May, on
the eth, llth, and 13th days of the month-

Τ1181 were also worshipped shortly after a
funeral at the ⁴ feriae denicaloe‚’ when the
family of the deceased went through a puri-
fication. Τ118 Lares being also the spirits
of the dead, differed only in name from the
Manes, which were ordinm-ily inserted in
sepulchral inscriptions, as the Dii Manes of
the departed. The name is derived from a
root signifying ‘ good,' for none but the good
could become Manes. But Angustiae (de
Civ. Dei, ix. ll) quotes the authority of
Plotinus (for whom it appears he should
have said Apuleius de Socratis Daemone)
for saying ‘⁶ animas hominum daemona
esse, et ex hominibus fieri Lares si boni
meriti sunt; Lemures si mali seu Larvas;
Manes autem deos dici si incertum est
bonorum eos 5811 malorum esse meritorum.”
This the name itself disproves. Their
existence was 8 matter of some scepticism‚
as observed on C. i. 4. 16. Here the 1181118
seems toembraoe all the insemel deities,
as Dis, Proserpina, Tellus, the Furiae, διο.
143. Tellurem ρον-σω] The temple of
Tellus in the Carinae has been mentioned
before, Epp. i. 7. 48, n. She was wor-
shipped among the ‘dii inferi' or Manen.
Her annual festival, the Fordicidia, was
celebrated on the l5th of April. ‘ Forda'

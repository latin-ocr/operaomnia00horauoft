HORATII FLAOOI

Musa, velim memores, et quo patre natus uterque

Contulerit lites.

·Ad pugnam venere.
Esse feri similem dico.''

Messius “ Accipio,'' caput et movet.

Messi clarum genus Osci;
Sarmenti domina exstat: ab his majoribus orti

Ni foret exsecto frons,'' inquit, “ quid faceres, cum

Sic mutilus miniteris ἓ’”’ At illi foeda cicatrix

Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.

Campanum in morbum, in faciem permulta jocatus,
Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat:

Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis.

Multa Cicirrhus ad haec : Donasset jamne catenam

Ex voto Laribus, quaerebat3 scriba quod esset,

Nihilo deterius dominae jus esse.

Denique cur unquam fugisset, cui satis una

Farris libra foret gracili sic tamque pusillo.

Prorsus jucunde coenam produximus illam.

58. Accipio, caput et movet] ¹ Messius
accepts Sarmentus' joke as a challenge, and
shakes his head fiercely at him, on which
Sarmentus takes him up and pretends to be
alarmed. The wild horse to which Messius
is likened is the unicorn, an imaginary ani-
mal described by Pliny (N. H. viii. 21):
“Asperrimam autem feram μονοκερώτην,
reliquo corpore equo similem, eapite cervo,
pedibus elephanto, cauda apro, mugitu
gravi, uno cornu nigro, media fronte cubi-
torum duum eminente;¹’—a terrible beast

605 miniteris .?] The MSS. and editions
are divided between this form and the indi-
cative. The subjunctive alone is right, and
Ι have adopted it with Bentley and Ven.
1483. See Key’s L. G. 1455, j.

63. Pastorem saltaret] That he should
dance the Cyclops dance, in which the un-
couth gestures of Polyphemus courting Ga-
latea were represented. See Epp. ii. 2,
125: “Nunc Satyrum nunc agrestem Cy-
clopa movetur.’' Ovid (Trist. ii. 519) uses
· salto ’ in the passive voice: “ Et mea sunt
populo saltata poemata saepe.’'

65. Donasset jamne catenam] ‘⁴ Urbanins
haec dicta sunt in Sarmentum qui servilibus
erat natalibus, sumpta translatione a gene-
rosis pueris, qui egressi annos pueritiae jam
sumpta toga Diis penatibus bullas suas
consec)rabaut, et ut puellae pupas ” (Comm.
Cruq .

67. Nihilo deterius] The editions, till
Baxter (who has ‘Nilo ¹), have ‘deterius

nihilo.’ ⁸Bentley says that all the oldest
and best MSS. have ‘ nihilo deterius! He
adopts it, and so does Dillenbr. and Orelli,
‘ nihilo ⁹ being pronounced as a dissyllabis,
like “vehemens et liquidus ” (Epp. ii. 2.
120). Fea quotes a great many MSS.in
favour of the old reading3 never-theless 1
prefer Bentley's.

68. una Farris libra] The allowance of
‘ far ' to each slave was four or five ‘ modii '
by the mouth, and it was served out ω
them monthly, or sometimes daily (Epp. i.
14. 40). That allowance would give three
pints a day, which Messius considers would
be three times as much as Sarmentus could
possibly require3 so he could not better
himself by running away. The ‘far’ was
otherwise called ‘adoreum,' and seems to
have been the same as the Greek ζειὰ οι·
ὄλυρα. The nature of this grain is not
exactly known. That two ns.above'
the condition of slaves should be found in
waiting on any man, great or otherwise, for
the purpose of entertaining him with such
low buffoonery as the above, seems sur-
prising to us; but we know that there was
no personal degradation to which this class
of people called ‘ parasites' (¹ diuers out ’)
would not demean themselves for the plea-
sure of a good dinner and the company of
the great. The entertainment of these per-
sons would serve to keep the conversation
from turning upon politics, which, as the
deputies from both sides were now together,
it was desirable to avoid.

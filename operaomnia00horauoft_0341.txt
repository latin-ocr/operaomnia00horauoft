EPODON LIBER, 16. 311

GARMEN XVI.

'nnis ode is written with great esre, 01111 was probably one of those compositions by
which Hor-oe brought himself into public notice. It has more the appearance of having
been written for fame than any other in the book. 1 have no doubt it was written soon
011101· Herses 001110 to Rome at the outbresk of the Perusina war, Α.11.0. 713. Some
follow whnt they suppose to be the meaning of the Scholinst Aaron, who says on the
word ⁴ Altera ⁹ (v. l)= ‘⁴ quando Antonius dimicavit oontn Augustum.¹' But he may
have referred to 1.. Antonius the eonsu13 st any rste the language 01111 sentiments ste so
different from nny that Horaee used or was likely to use about the time of Actium, that
the ode cannot be referred to that period. The stete of Rome at the time supposed is
described very vividly by Appiun (Bel. Civ. v. 18—49) 01111 Dion (xlviii. 9—15). It has
been supposed that the notion of migrating to the fortunate islanda, which many of the
oemmentators have taken too literaIIy, was derived from the words of Sertorius, recorded
by Plutarch in his life (e. viii.)‚ und said by the Scholia-st Acron to have been mentioned
by Sallust. (If this remark be true, it seems to show that Sallust's History included
some part at least of the period of Sulla, about which there 1100 been some doubt.) When
he was 110111 pushed by Luscus the legate of Sulla, Sertorius, falling in with some sailors
who 11011 visited or been driven to the Western 1011111110, sud hearing from them 0 glowing
description of their climate, is said to 110110 eonoeived 0 desire to go 01111 live there, 01111
so to get rid of the troubles of his life 01111 the never-ending wurs. Sertorius’ speech
may 110νο become notorious, or Horace may have heard of it3 but the 11100 my have
occurred to him independently or been suggested, ss the description seems in part to
have been, by Pindu's ἄθεα-1911011 of the Happy Ishnds (01. ii. 70, sqq.), 01111 Hesiod’s
of the sume (Op. et Di. 167) : τοῖς δὲ δίχ’ ἀνθρώπων βίοτον καὶ ἤθε’ ὀπάσσας, cml„
or Roma-'s description of the Elysinn plsins (Odyss. v. 563, sqq.).

ARGUMENT.

Another age is wasting in civil wax-s. She whom no enemy eould tame shall be destroyed
by her own aoeursed children ; the wild beast shall devour her; the bubni-ian shall
trsmple upon her, 01111 sestter the dust of her Romulus to the winds. what are we to
do? Go forth like the Phocaeam, 1001νο 0111· homes 01111 0111· temples to be the dens of
heasts, 01111 go 111101ον01- the winds shall wast us. shall it be so? ‘rhen why delay?
But let us swen- z—when rocks shall swim, 01111 the Po shall wash the tops of Matium,
01111 the Apenuine be eust into the sem when the tiger shall lie with the 1111111, sud the
dove with the hswk‚ and the herds seur not the lion, 01111 the he-gost shall love the
umes—then we will return to om· home. Thus let the nobler spirits resolve while the
(zi-aven eliugs to his couch. For us there are those happy isles where the earth yields her
harvests 01111 the trees their fruit uubidden ; where honey drops from the 0011, 01111 the
stream leaps babbling from the hills 3 where the goat eomes uubidden to the milk-pail,
01111 udders are full, 01111 the fold fears uo beasts, und the ground beers no viper-3 where
the rain-flood 01111 the drought are not known3 whither¹ the venturous 0011 eomes not3
where the flock is unhurt by pestilenee or hest. Jove destined these shores for the
pious when the golden age 11011 passed away, 01111 thither the pious my resort 01111

Est qui neo veteris pocula Massici

Nec partem solido demere de die 20
Spernit, nuno viridi membra sub arbuto
Stratus, nunc ad aquae lene caput sacrae.
Multos castra. juvant et lituo tubae

Per-mixtus sonitus bellaque matribus
Detestata. Manet sub Jove frigido 25
Venator tenerae conjugis immemor,

Seu visa est catulis cerva fidelibus,

Seu rupit teretes Marsus aper plagas.

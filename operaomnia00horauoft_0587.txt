Insanire putas 801181111118 1118 neque rides,

Nec medici credis nee curatoris· egere

A praetore dati, rerum tutela mearum

Cum sis et prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem

De te pendentis, te respicientis amici.

Ad summam: sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum;
Praecipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est.

mys this looks like a proverbial expression
for one who did not know his own mind.
It may be so, or it may have reference
to alterations Horace was making on his
estate, in which case the whole would be
only a joke against himself, or truth in jest,
which Maecenas would understand. He

to have begun building directly he
entered on his new property, if there is any
meaning in the scolding he gets from Dama-
sippus (S. ii. 3. 307).

102. nec curatoris eyere] See S. 11. 3.
217,11. Though in the next line no one
would suppose Horace meant‘ tutela' liter-
ally y, as Orelli say s, who is himself too
lita-al, yet the word is suggested by the
context. ‘’Tutela was the guardianship
of a ‘tuton’ the protector of an orphan’ s
property till he came to the age of puberty.
⁶ Curatela' was the office of ‘ curator,' who
had the same relation to the orphan in a
modified form (see Dict. Ant. ‘ Curator’) till
he was twenty-five (see above, v. 22, n.).
It was also that of the protector of insane
persona- Though ‘tutela ’ therefore is not
the precise word to keep up the previous
notion, it has more force here than ‘ prae-
sidium,' by which Orelli explains it. Horace
means that Maecenas looks after him
anxionsly as if he was his ‘ tutor,’ and he
looks up to him as if he was his ⁴ pupillus,'
butthathisguardian hadbetterlooktohis
greater faults and correct those than be put
out by trifling defecta, such ω negligence of
dress, and so forth. What may have passed
between Horace and his patron to give rise
to this piece of raillery, which is meant to
eonvey a satire on the world in general,
especially the fashionable world, with whom
then as now viem were oes and
breaches of etiquette unpardonable sins, we
08111101 tell. He writes to Maecenas ont of
the familiarity of frequent intercourse, and
such intimacy gives rise to ideas and lan-
guage which none but the friends themselves
can fully enter into. What Horace says is
a repetition in a different form of “ O et
pyaesidium et dulce decus meum '’ (C. i. l.

105. respicientia] For this Heinsius
conjectured and Bentley has adopted ⁴ sus-
picientis,’ which has no authority, and is not
wanted. Caesar (B. C. i. 1) says, “ Sin
Caesarem respiciant atque ejus gratiam
sequantur ut superioribus fecerint tempori-
bus,'’ &c. Forcellini does not notice this
use of the word. It is much stronger than
our term ⁴ respect,’ which is derived from it.

106. Ad summanu] This is an ordi·
nary formula, ‘ to come to the point,’ ‘to
conclude! The pun-suit of virtue and wis-
dom is the point from which 118 started, and
having di gressed a little he returns suddenly,
and concludes with a definition of the sage,
which is a repetition of S. i. 3. 124, sqq:

dives qui sapiens est,
Et sutor bonus et solus formosus et est rex!

Here it is added that he is the only freemnn,
and inferior to Jove alone3 and this Acron
says is only in consequence of his mortality.
He is a king because he governs his pas-
sions 3 he is free through an indifference
which it is the business of his life to culti-
vate ; 118 18 rich because he wants nothing;
he is beautiful because virtue is beautiful;
he is equal to Jove because he rises above
the world, and abo because he is above 811
1111111811 1811,-8 doctrine which the later
Stoios held as rising naturally out of the per-
fection of his reason and the purity of his mo-
tives. Τ118 attempt to apply these notions
to man as he is, led necessarily to practica!
inconsistencies involving the wildaet im-
moralitiae. But the Stoica meant well, and
would have effected a reign of virtue if they
could have had their wishoe. Horace says,
with au intentional bathos, the Stoic above
all his other attributes is of course ‘sanus,’
except when his digestion is disturbed and
the phlegm troublesome; ‘ sanus' bearing a
double application to the body (from the
pains of which no exemption was claimed
for the Stoic sage, though he did not allow
them to affect his will) andto the mind, the
sanity of which no one could lay claim to
but the sage himself (see S. ii. 3. 44, n. .
As to ‘ pituita: see S. ii. 2. 73, 11. ,

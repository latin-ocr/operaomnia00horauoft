Cerea suppliciter stabat servilibus ut quae

Altera Tisiphonen ; serpentes atque videres

Ne foret his testis post magna latere sepulcra.
Mentior at si quid merdis caput inquiner albis

Umbrae cum Sagana resonarent triste et acutum,

32. een-'libus — modia] There was
scarcely any imaginable form of eruelty to
which slaves were not liable through the
oeprioe of their owners, aud this of roasting
or halfroasting alive may have happened
to more than one poor wretch of this class.
Tacitus (Hist- ii. 71) says of a runaway
“Sumptum de eo supplicium in ser·
vilemmodum;' 'andagain ofafre'edman of
Vitellius (Hist. iv. 11):‘ ‘Asiaticus malam
potenti-m servili supplicio expiavit.’' The

was u‘tqlue ‘Ut quae, ’which
gambinus stmngly deuouncae, Bentley very
properly, and on good authority, received
into hia text.

34. aerpenteae— Infernas mare cauea]
Smnkee in her hair, round her waist, and in
her hand for a whip, are insignia always
to be found in the representations of Tisi-
phone. Τὶιε infernal hounds are those that
virgil mentions as howling at the approach
of Heoete (Aen. vi. 257): ‘¹ Vi
ululare per umbram, Adventante Deal'

saeque canes

’ ⁷ So the witch in Theocritus (ii. 35) knows

tIliecate is coming by the howling of ‚the
θῖεσίυλι, ται κύνες ἀμμὶν ἀνὰ πτόλιν

ὠρύονται·
‘A θεὸς’ εν τριόδοισι.

36. sepulcra] See note above on v. 17.
39. Julius et srayilis Pediatia] Τ118
connexion between these persone, Julius
aud Pediatius, is stated to have been of a

'. ' kind not mentionable. Julius may have

been a freedman of the dictator C. Julius
cassu, aud the other person is said by
Comm. Cruq. and Porphyrion to have been
a Roman eques. The feminine termination
ia affixed to his name to indioete that he
was addicted to the vilest practices, as
Aristophanes (Nub. 678. 680)callsSostratus
aud Cleon ymus ‘'Sostrata and‘ Cleonym a!
of* Vox-anus: Porphyrion and eomm. Cruq.

⁸give us the following

piece of gossip:

“Aiunt Voranum Q. Lucatii Catuli libertum
fuisse adeo furacem ut nummos subreptos
a nummulario iu calceos demiserit3 a quo
cum deprehensus met, quidam subridens
Belle, inquit, si te non ἐκχαλκεύει; hoc aet
verberibus tanquam aes recudat, alludens
ad ealceos.” It so happens that we meet
with this managain in another Scholium on
Juvenal viii. 186, where mention is made of
a farce by one Catullus (an adaptation of the
Phasma of Menander mentioned by Terence,
Eunuch, Prol- 9), spoken of as a elever writer
of plays by Martial (v. 31. 3), and by Aulus
Gellius (xix. 9, where he gives some exe-
crable verses of his by way of a song). An
old Scholiast on Juvenal (S. iii. 111: “ Mi-
mum agit ille Urbani qualem fugitivus scurra
Catulli ’') says: ‘¹ Q. Lutatium Catullum
dicit qui Voranum servum furacissimum
habuisse fertur, de quo huic posterius
⁴ scurraCatulli :' de quo etiam illud traditur
quum—deprehensus a numulario esset cujus
de mensa nummos subtractos in calceos
sibi inferciverat, quidam jocans in eum Belle
inquit si te numularius in jus vocet, tu ei
aes ablatum ex ealceo abjiceres. '’

41. resonarent triste et acutum] This
corrosponds with Virgil’ s description (Aen.
vi. 492),‘ ‘pars tollere vocem
Bentley, soeing no difference between the
continuous action in ‘resonarent' and the
complete action contained ιιι the verbs that
follow, invents‚ against all the MSS. and
the usage of the language, ‘ssraeonarint and
affirms positively, ‘'sua fide et periculo‚'
that this· is the word Horace wrote. Inde-
pendently of the imperfect being required
in this place, who ever heard of such a
perfect as‘ resonaverim. ³’ The participles
are so formed, no doubt, as “os magna
sonaturum’' (S. i. 4. 44); but Bentley can

produce no better authority than Manilius
and Prudentius for‘ resonavil'

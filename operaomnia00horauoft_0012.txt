vi PREFAGE.

no editor discharges his duty who does not take that course. The
result I have given, in each case, in the notes or introduction, or
both3 and in order to help the reader to form his own judgment‚
I have added, in such cases as admitted of it, the substance of each
poem in the form of an Argument. This serves the purpose of
giving a conspective view of the poem and its scope, and the conss
nexion of the different parts, and often supplies a word or sentence
which it otherwise might be necessary to translate in a note. The
Arguments and Introductions will be found to relieve the notes
considerably.

I have done my best to determine the merits of the various
readings, and to choose in every disputed case the best, according
to my judgment. I have given in a note the amount of authority
for each disputed reading that 1 have adopted, and there is not a

always differ as to the choice of readings, but to desert the MSS.
and resort to conjecture in the case of this author I hold to be
inexcusable. I have not seen the smallest excuse for it in any
single instance, and with this opinion I can only look upon the
numerous conjectura] readings of Bentley (nearly all of which I

have referred to in the notes) as so many instances of false taste ’

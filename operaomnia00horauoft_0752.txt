HORATII FLAGOI

Doctum imitatorem et vivas hinc ducere ¹voces.
Interdum speciosa locis morataque recte

Fabula nullius veneris, sine pondere et arte,

320

Valdius oblectat populum meliusque moratur
Quam versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae.
Graiis ingenium, Graiis dedit ore rotundo
Musa loqui, praeter laudem nullius avaris.

Romani pueri longis rationibus assem
Discunt in partes centum diducere.

‘⁴ Dicat

Filius Albini : Si de quincunce remota est
Uncia, quid superat? Poteras dixisse.'' “ Triens.'' “ Eu !

“ Semis.''

Οιιιιι semel imbuerit, speramus carmina fingi
Posse linenda cedro et levi servanda cupresso?
Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poet-ae,

Aut simul et jucunda et idonea dicere vitae.

Quidquid praecipies esto brevis, ut cito dicta

Percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles ;
Omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat.
Ficta voluptatis causa. sint proxima veris,

Nec quodcunque volet poscat sibi fabula credi,

318. vivas hine ducere vocem] Living
words are those that represent nature to
the life, or which convey a vivid sense to
the understanding.

319. speciosa loeis] Full of telling
common-places, senfiments, examples, and
so on.

323. Graiis inyem’um‚] He says the
Greeks had a natural taste for poetry, and

cultivated it from an ambition to excel and'

thirst for praise, which Porphyrion illus-
trates by the example of Apelles, who took
ten years to finish his famous picture of
Venus rising from the sea (Ἀφροδίτη ἀνα-
δυομένη). But this compar-ison of the
Greeks and Romans does not ap to be
connected with the subject that goes before
or the rules that follow from v. 333.

325. Romam· pueri] See S. i. 6. 72.
77, ιι. The ‘as' was divided into twelve
parts, ‘unciae‚’ of which the ‘quincunx’
contained five, and the ‘ triens ' four, being
one-third of the whole, whence the name.
The ‘semis' contained six, being half an as.
Albinus, according to Comm. Cruq., was
the name of an usurer. Bentley substitutes
‘ dieas ’ for ‘ dicat ' without reason or au-
thority. Horace is representing a scene in

a boy s' school. “:Macter Iaet the son of
Albinus tell me. if you take an uncis stom
a quincunx, how much remeius. θ (The
boy hesitantes ) You used to news-1³03.-
A triens. Mastem Very well. Yon viu
know how to mire mre of your money.
Now add an uncia: what is the sum?
Boy: A semis.’' Bentley also reads ‘po-
terat ' for ⁴ poteras! Some MSS. have thu:
reading. He also punctuates thus: ¹ potent
dixisse, triens?' For ‘at haec' Bentley
reads ‘ an! Orelli says 1a-u1y there is more
indignationin‘ at!

332. linenda cedro] Bookswere amem-ed
with oil of oedar to keep them frum the m-
sects. ‘Capsae cupressinae,¹ ‘book-cases οἰ
cypress- w-ood, were costly, and would mly
be used for valuable books.

337. Omne supervacuum] Benflevsus-
pects this verse and puts it in brackets· Ι

cannot tell why. He thinks it nme and ι

obscure. It is at any rate vox-ymo that
when the mind· is full it disemis ull super·
fluous words when expressing its meaning-
it has no room for superfluities, as in a
ves sel that is full, if you pour more it runs

over and escapes. As to ‘ supervacuus’ see ¹

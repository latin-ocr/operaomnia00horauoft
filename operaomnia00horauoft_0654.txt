HORATII FLAOOI

NE perconteris fundus meus, optime Quinti,

Arvo pascat herum an baccis opulentet olivae,

Pomisne et pratis an amicta vitibus ulmo,

Scribetur tibi forma loquaciter et situs agri.

Continui montes ni dissocientur opaca 5
Valle, sed ut veniens dextrum latus adspiciat Sol,

Laevum discedens curru fugiente vaporet.

Temperiem laudes.

1. fundus] See S. ii. 5. 108, n.

2. Arvo pascat lterum] Horace had
some of his land under his own cultivation,
but it was no great quantity, 88 we may
infer from the number of slaves employed
upon it (S. ii. 7. 118). Τ118 rest he seems
to have let (Epp. 14. 2, n.). Part of his
land was arable and part of it meadow
(Epp. 15. 26—-30, and C. iii. 16. 30, ¹¹ segetis
certa fides meae '').

14 42 Η8 had a garden (Epp.

He must also have had vines
(23, n. . In short, it was an ordinary farm
on a small scale. The second and third
verses, though not put directly as a descrip-
tion, are so to be understood I think. Ho-
race recounts the different productions of
his farm, while he supposes Quintius to ask
about them3 otherwise, as de Chaupy says
(vol. i. p. 357), the subsequent description is
meagre enough, and all we learn is that the
land produced wild cherries, plums‚ and
acorns.

— opulentet] This word does not occur
in any earlier writer. Forcellini produces
only one other instance, from Columella.

3. an amicta vitibus ulmo,] See C. ii.
15. 5: “platanusque caelebs Evincet ul-
mos.'’ Τ118 render may be interested in
what de Chaupy saw: “Je remarquerai
sur les vignes, qu'elles y on conserve 18
forme antique peinte par Horace, qui con-
siste a y etre exactement mariees aux or-
meaux. Dans la Vallee de Licence et dans
le reste de 18 Sabine antique en effet les
vignes sont en ce qu’on appelle Alberetti.
On plante en meme tems, et on taille en-
suite dans la meme saison le cep, qui forme
18 vigne et l'ormeau qui doit l’elever et
l’appuier: les deux plantes (ει-01888111 et
vivent ainsi ensemble avec un sort si uni,
que de meme que l'ormeau devient inutile
lorsqu'il perd la vigne, ainsi 18 vigne reste
quasi sans ressource si l’arbre qui lui sert
d’appui vient a mourir’' (iii. 545). He
says the olive is less cultivated in this valley
than it might be, in consequence of the
large quantity that is grown at Tivoli.
Other fruits, he says, continue abundant
and good in the valley of Licenza. He

Quid, si rubicunda benigni

also speaks of the oak and holm oak (le
chene sp,vert) and the wild plum and wild
cherry (¹ cornus ’,) as growing every where.

5. Continui montes] De Chaup py's de-
scription (iii. 284) of the valley of the
Licenza is, that it is the only valley which
euts the vast range of mountains extending
from the Campagna above Tibur to Carseoli,
about forty-five miles from Rome. With-
out this valley, he says, this immense body
would be a continuous mass. The valley
is not formed by a simple depression of the
mountains, but they seem to open down to
their foundations to produce it. This ho
thinks gives more force to the word ¹ late-
brae ⁷ in v. 15. The valley, he says, seems
to have neither entrance nor exit. It lies
nearly north and south, which eorre-
sponds with the description of the text.
De Chaupy professes to have found the
ruins of Horace's house 011 the western
side of this valley‚ its aspect being chiefly
east. But there is not much reliance to
be placed on this, and the map he 1188
given is likely to mislead, the points of
the compass being inaccurately marked. Δ
writer quoted by Obbarins, and said by him
to have investigated these localities before De
Chaupy (Ger. Heerken's Notabil. l. ii. p. 31)
2²23.. ...izffiffffiziffiffifflffiss
vallem videbantur quinque millium inclu-
dere.'’ This corresponds with De Chaupy's
account and the rough map he gives of the
country. The Scholiasta Acron and Comm-
Cruq. say that both the valley and. one of
the mountains was called Ustiea3 but see
c. i. 17. 1, n.

8. Temperiem laudea] The position of
the valley, De Chaupy says, keeps it 8001
111 summer and warin in winter, the latter
by the exclusion of the north wind
montana). The Scirocco (¹ plumbeus Aus-
ter ') he says 18 either excluded altogether,
or the little of it that penetrates the 1110011-
tains is so purg ged of its noxious qualities
on the way that it does no harm.

— Quid, si rubicunda] There is no
necessity for making two interrogative sen-

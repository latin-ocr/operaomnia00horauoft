Munditiae pepulere; sed in longum tamen aevum

HORATII FLAGGI

Manserunt hodieque manent vestigia ruris. 160
Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis,

Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere coepit

Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent.
Tentavit quoque rem, si digne vertere posset, γ
Et placuit sibi, natura sublimis et acer3 165
Nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet,

Sed turpem putat inscite metuitque lituram.

Creditur ex medio quia res arcessit habere

Sudoris minimum, sed habet comoedia tanto

Plus oneris quanto veniae minus.

Quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi,

To such specimens of Saturnian verse Ho-
race's epithet is not misapplied3 but Ι be-
lieve, with all deference to Niebuhr, that
they afford no idea of the structure of the
Saturnian verse. Any nation, with any
preteusion to poetry, would have something
better than this.

163. Quid Sophocles et Thespis et
Aeschylus] Thespis is here introduced as

, being the reputed founder of Greek tragedy.

It is doubtful whether any of his plays were
translated by or known to the Roman trage-
dians, of whom Horace has mentioned
Livius, Ennius, Naevius, Pacuvius, and
Accius. We know of no others earlier than
Accius the last of these3 and the number of
tragedies by these writers, the titles of
which have been preserved, is 119. As to
Thespis, see A.P. 275, n.

167. metuitque lituram] That is, they
were bold enough in their style, and had the
spirit of tragedy in them, but they did not
look sufficiently to the correction aud polish-
ing of their language; they admitted words
which were out of taste, and thought too
much care in composition beneath them.
This is pretty much what he says of Lucilius
(S. i. 10. 56, sqq.).

168. arcessit] See Epp. i, 5. 6, n.
⁴ Ex medio' is from common life. Horace
says comedy is supposed to be very easy,
because the matter is common ς but, in
fact, it gives more trouble in proportion to
the readiness with which it is criticised and
faults are detected and condemned.

170. Plautus] Orelli thinks he sees in

this place remarkable pleasant-ry (‘singu-
larem festivitatem a nullo adhuc animad-
versam '). Suetonius (vit. Aug. c. 89) says-³
“ Augustus plane poiimatum quoque non
imperitus, delectabatur etiam comoedia ve-
teri, et saepe eam exhibuitpublicis specta„
culis.'’ He thinks therefore Horace is joking
the emperor upon this taste of his for the
old comio writers. However this may be,
it appears that Horace had no great opinion
of Plautus, all whose greatness, he says, lay
in the drawing of small parts. Niebuhr
judges otherwise: he calls him oue of the
greatest poetical geniuses of antiquity. ‘⁸ He
shows his great talent in his bold and sree,
though somewhat singular, manner of deal-
ing with his characters. He takes Greek
pieces with Greek ‘ dramatis pfflsonaess and
treats them with a perfect irony. Tho
Greeks in his plays speak out, and are witty
as Romans would be. What makes Plautus
such a wonderful poet is, that on this
slippery ground he always shows the most
extraordinary skill in hitting the right
point. His language is 110 less admirable
than his poetical skill. If we compare his
lang-uage with that of his predecessors, we
find it greatly altered, enriched, and refined,
which is aproof that the language was much
cultivated at that time; for had this not
been the case, it would certainly be very
different from what it is in the eomedies of

Plautus'' (v. iv. p. 261, sq.). The language .

of Plautus would be rough to the ears οῖ

Horace, and his jokes and allusione, drawn Δὶ

principally from the lower orders, or taken

from the Greek and adapted to the common ⁴

sort of people, did not interest him. Ho—

race’s taste was not of 8 very masculine s

order, and it is not difficult to understand.

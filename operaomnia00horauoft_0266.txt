236 HORATII FLACOI

like minute points except as it helps ns to traee the progr-ess of Horace's mind and style,
which it is plain went through a great change aster the publication of the three first book·
of the odes. 1 very much doubt whether he could have copied himself so exactly as he
has done in those two odes if any great interval had elapsed between them. Ι therefore
am inclined to set down this among Horaee's earlier odes which he brought out of his
desk for the purpose above mentioned. But others will have their own opinion, and 1
am not wedded to mine. It will at any rate be observed that the introducam of Tor·
quatus' name or the omission of it would be equally immaterial to the character and
scope of the ode, and that what has been said of other odes, and among them that above
referred to. is equally applicable to this, namely, that the name of a ffiend is only inim-
duced to give life and individuality to the poem.

ARGUMENT.

The winter is gone and the spring is returning with its green leaves, ite gentler streame,
and its Graces. Τὴο seasons change and remind us of our end: but the revolving year
repairs its losses, while we go to the dust for ever, and we know not when it will be.
What thou dost enjoy thyself is so much taken from thy greedy heir. When thou art
dead, Torquatus, thy family, thine eloquence, and thy piety will not restore thee to
life any more than the love of Diana could bring back Hippolytus or the friendship of
Theseus Peirithous.

DIFFUGERE nives, redeunt jam gramina campis
Arboribusque comae ;

Mutat terra vices et decrescentia ripas
Flumina praetereunt; ·

Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet 5

Ducere nuda choros.
Immortalia ne speres monet annus et almum

Quae rapit hora diem.

Frigora mitescunt Zephyris, ver proterit aestas
Interitura simul 10

Pomifer Auctumnus fruges effuderit, et mox
Bruma recurrit iners.

Damna tamen celeres reparant caelestia lunae:

Nos ubi decidimus
Quo pius Aeneas quo dives Tullus et Ancus 15

Pulvis et umbra sumus.

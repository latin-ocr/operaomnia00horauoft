to the doeertion of Antonius’ naval force, as
the soregoing refer to his troops. Some of
his ships either did not enter the battle or
quittedp it and took shelter in some neigh-

it must be understood that the deserting
ships made their aeoepe from the scene of
action into the gulf, and there remained till
the battle was over. Bentley, without ac-
lmowledging that Heinsius had preceded
him with the same notion, supposes ‘ sinis-
trorsum citae’ maybe equivalent to πρύμνην
mastonem, ‘to back ναῖοι-3 Something
of that sort, connected with ssight, Ι have
ιιο doubt it means. Whether Horace ex-
actly stateswhat he had heard, and whether
the information was precisely correct, we
annot tell. He wrote while the tidings
were fioeh, and probably gave only popular
reporta. The defection of the Galatians' is
mentioned by Plutarch (Ant. 63). Servius
gives the number 2000, but he probably
only copied Horace’s statement. ‘Citae'
is the participle of ‘ cieo!

Trajan used to take him up by his side on

is described by Zonaras (vii. 21) asthat of a

is here said about Scipio's tomb is that hin
valour built him oue on the ruins of Car-
thage, which is no more than a repetition
of C. iv. 8. 17. Acron’s story, that the
Romans, by command of the oracle, built a
tomb to Scipio at the mouth of the Tiber
looking towards Carthage, is no doubt a
fabrication3 and Turnebus' note, “cujus
sepulchro eversae ' ' titulus sub--
scriptus astl' if it were true would have
nothing to do with Horace’s words. No
doubt the conquat of was, as he
says, “ titulo res digna sepulchri ” (J uv. vi.
230). But Horace is speaking of a tomb
of renown, in which Scipio’s memory is
enshrined, not his body. Bentley has a
long note here, the substance of which is
this: ‘Africanum' may mean either the
elder or younger Scipio; if the elder is
understood, we must suppose that ‘ sepul-
chrum ’ means Ennius’ poem (see C. iv'. 8.
17, ιι.), which was to him a tomb or
monument ‘surpassing Carthage3' but if
the younger is meant, then he proposes to
change cui ’ into‘ quo, ' that we may have

one can deny that ‘quo super' may mean

Themistocles’ in another epigram. But
why the reading of all the MSS„ which is

difficult to tell. It yields a very good
sense. 1 think it refers to the younger
Scipio, which gives the most obvious mean·

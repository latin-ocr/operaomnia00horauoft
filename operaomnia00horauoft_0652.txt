37. corrector Reatina] This reading is
due to Lambinus, who first conjectured it,
and, before the publication of his second
edition, found it in one of his oldest MSSq
but did not take it into the text. Bentley
defends it, and was the first editor to adopt
it. Most modern editors have done the
same. The meaning, if this be the true
reading, is, that Maenius, whenever 118
0011111 not get a good 111111181- from one of
those who patronized or were afraid of him,
would dine prodigiously off tripe and coarse
mutton, and then declare all good livers
ought to be branded on the belly: a censor
as strict 83 Bestius, who was no doubt some
person well known at the time, perhaps as
a spare liver or reprover of profligate living,
though nothing is known of him now.
⁴ Corrector, ’ which was used in 8 technical
sense during the empire for a person sent
into a province to put it in order, a special
commissioner, is here used (if it is the true
reading) for a reformer of morals, as in
Epp.·1i. l. 129 it is applied to poetS. The
old readings and those of most of the MSS.
are ‘correctus ’ and ‘correptus.' Some
editions have the stop before Bestius and
others after it: some also substitute Mae-
nius for Bestius, connecting it with ‘ idem.
The amount of authority and support for
each of these readings may be learnt from
Obbarius 01· Fea. The MS. authority for
‘corrector' is very small, but 1 believe
it is right. 1 can make no sense of the
others.

39. Verterat iu sumum et cinerem,]

This was evidently 811 ordinary way of
speaking. We need not refer the expres-
sion to the sacking of towns or the 1111011811
fire, as an authorityq noted by Orelli 11083.
Η8 got rid of all the plunder he made from
fools who patronized him.

41. Nil melius turdo, nil vulva] As to
‘turdus' see S. ii. 5. 10, 11. The womb
and 111-8831 (‘ sumen ') of 8 sow, especially
after her first litter, were considered great
delicacies.

42. Nimirum hic eqo sum .·] Compare
Epp. 6. 40: ‘ne fueris hic tu.'' ἐνταῦθ’
εἰμι’ 13 8 common expression with the Tra-
gedians. ‘Nimirumss of course, 83 13 na»
tural: how could any thing better be ex-
pected of me? (See Epp. 9. 1.) He 1118883
to say that of course, like his neighbouts,
he professes love for poverty while he 13
poor, but directly he gets any money 118 is
ready for any extravagance.

46. nitidis fundata pecunia villa]
‘Villa' was 8 country house. as opposed to
⁴,aedes' a town house. There were ‘villae

rusticae‚’ farm houses, and‘ vfflaeurbnnael
houses in the neighbourhood of towns (to
which sense we limit the word in our use· -
of it) or in the country, but built in 'many
respects aster the fashion of town houm.
A good description of both 13 given in
Becker’ s Gallus. The ‘urbanae villae*
were often built at great expense, with
much marble about them, which 13 referred
to in ‘nitidis.⁷ ‘Fundata’ means ‘invesoedl
I am not aware of its being 30 1138118138-
where.

HORATII FLAcol

Sappho puellis de popularibus, 25
Et te sonantem plenius aureo,
Alcaee, plectro dura navis,
Dura fugae mala, dura belli!
Utrumque sacro digna silentio
Mirantur umbrae dicere; sed magis - 3ο
Pugnas et exactos tyrannos
Densum humeris bibit aure volgus.
Quid mirum, ubi illis carminibus stupens
Demittit atras belua centiceps
Aures et intorti capillis , 35
Eumenidum recreantur angues?

tora genti;'' and Virgil (Aen. viii. 670)
1133 “Secretosque pios.” But these prove
nothing, but rather lead to the inference
that, if Horace had used 3 compound of
‘cerno ' here, he would have used ⁴ secretas!

24. querentem Sappho puellis de popu-
laribua,] On this Acron says: “ Querebatur
autem Sappho de puellis suis civibus quia
non amarent quem ipsa diligebat ;'’ which
Porphyrion varies thus: “ quia Oden non
ament quem ipsa diligebat amens.'¹ Cru-
quius' Scholiast explains their meaning,
and shows the corruption of their text. He
says: “ Querebatur autem Sappho de puel-
lis suae gentis quod amarent Phaonem quem
ipsa amabat.'' This, however, is probably
not the true explanation. The passionate
tenderness with which Sappho could write
to her young female friends, and her jealousy
of rivals in their affections, imply a state of
feelings which we cannot very well enter
into in our present 308131 condition. A
woman could only write to her lover now
in such language as Sappho could address
to Atthis, a young friend 31111 11111111 who had
transferred her affectione to Andromeda, a
rival of the poetess: —

γλυκύπικρον ἀμάχανον ἕρπετον·

'Aa-91¹, σοὶ δ’ ἐμέθεν μὲν ἀπήχθετο

(4 43 Bergk.)

The affection of Socrates for some of his
young pupils was of that sublimated kind
which was liable to be mistaken for a grosser
feeling3 and 1 consider it next to impossible
for any modern reader fully to enter into the
language of the ‘”Phaedms and comprehend
the quality of the feeling 3 there described
as Plato understood them, if he did under-

stand them. On the subject os Sappho the
reader may consult Miiller’ s Dorians, B. iv.

30. Mirantur—dicere .·] This is another
of Horace’s many Greek constructions for
‘ mirantur dicentes!

32. Densum humeris] Bentley, disliking
‘humeris,’ and desiringanep ithetfor‘ anm,’
proposes ‘humili’ or ‘avidass but prefers the
latter, because the Scholiasta 1318111181*δί-
bit’ ‘avide audit,' ‘cupidissime audit! But
we may believe that he who interpreted
‘ bibit' ‘ avide audit,’ had not ‘ avida aure'
before him when he wrote. Bentley is not
confident that Horace wrote ‘avida’ but
thinks he would have done better if he had.

33. carminibus] This is the ablative
case, as (S. i. 4. 28) “ Stupet Albius aere.”
(S. ii. 7. 95) “Vel quum Pausiaca torpeo,
insane, tabella.''

34. centiceps] Elsewhere Horace repre-
sents Cerberus with three heads (C. ii. 19.
31), 31111 (C. iii. ll. 20); in the latter of
which places, which greatly resembles this
and should be compared with it, he describes
him with a hundred snakes 'guarding

heads, but three 13 the more usual account.

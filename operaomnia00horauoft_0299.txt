an Augustus had determined on the expedition against M. Antonius and Cleopatra

which led to the battle of Actium, mmo. 723, he summoned, as we learn from Dion Cas-
sim (5⁰. 11), the leading senators and men of Eqffiu-inn rank to meet him at Brundu-
ἀει-ι, fur flne henefit of their counsel aud (the historian says) to keep the Equestrians (mm
mmm-nd also toshowtheworldthe harmonytowhieh he had brought men ofall,
udus at Rome. whatever the mot-ivea may have been, the fact may be accepted.
Maecenas oheyed this summons and went to Brundusium, but was sent back by Augustus
to watch over the peace of the city and the affairs of Imly, with what particular powers,
or under what title, history does not inform us, nor is the question material here. The
Scholiasta (Acron aud Οοωιιι. eruq.) state that Maecenas had had the command of the
fleet,or patefit, as tribune, given him byAugustus. But there is uo oeedit tobe
attached to such statements, which are osten taken (as this may be), like the inscriptions
invented by grammarians, from incidental names and allusions in the odes themselves.
He appears to have accompanied the expedition to Sicily against Sextus Pompeius a.u.c.
718, and, on referring to the article ⁸ Maecenas ' in Smith's Dict- Biog„ it will be seen
tha the writer is of opinion this Epode was written ou that ocoesion. This opinion is
quite new, and I believe the general opinion to be correct. sse language of affection in
this Epode is too strong for the short acquaintance Horace had then enjoyed with
Maecenas ; also, there is evidence of the Sabine farm having come into Horace’s posses-
sion when he mne it (v. 31). But that this did not ooeur tiu after the publication of the
first book of Satires is certain, and it is generally referred to tame. 720. The opinion
ofthe aamewriterthat HoraceactuallyaccompaniedMaecenason thisexpedifiou to Sicily
innotioed elsewhere (C.iii. 4.26,n.). Itisverypossihle that Maecenas mayhave had
the offer of a command on the expedition against M. Antonius, and thatboth heand
Horace believed he was goingon that service, until on his arrival at Brundusium Augustus
thoughtfit to send him back to discharge more important dutioe at Rome. Horace,
supposing him to be going on this expedition, wished to accompany him, but Maecenas
would not allow it (v. 7), which gave occasion for this Epode.

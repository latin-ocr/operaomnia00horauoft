Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus

Emunctae naris, durus componere versus.
Nam fuit hoc vitiosus: in hora saepe ducentos

Horsce ssys of Lucilius in brief is this:
that his whole strength wss lsid out on the
nfirizing of vice in the persons of living
chsrscters3 thet he yimitsted here-
y, only
chmging their metre; that be was funuy
und acute, but hmh in his style of versi-
fiestion; wordy sud sometimes
consequence of the hsste with which he
wrote md lm impstienee of the trouble of
conecting. Psmilisr ss Horace must hsve
bem withlaucilius’ wrifings, this description
msy be tskenss s correct one. It beers
amr-cyontheface of it ss fsrssitgoes,
for the uiticism touches only the surfsee,
sud the criu'c could not be mistaken, and is
not to be supposed to heve lied. In fect he
says below (S. 10. 3) the most idoletrous
admirer of Lucilius could not deny the truth
of his statement, that his style was uncouth.
He there slso adds that Lucilius loved to

withsumding his sstiricel vein (v. 53), aud
again thst he wss very unreeerved and frsnk
(S. ii. l. 30—34). This is vslusble toefi-
mony ss to the character of Lucilius and
his writings; and ss other writers have
neither added much to it nor sucoessfully
impugned it, sud since the fragments of
Lucilius that have come down to us are
too short to form s very sccurete opinion

’ upon, butin some points st least (such ss

the a’bsurd mixture of Greek end Latin)
beer out Horsce' s statements, we may con-
sider this satire and the otliers es useful
contributions to the history of Roman
literature.

7. Mutatis tantum pedibus] The writings
of Lucilius s ppesr to heve been very early
divided hythe gramma-iaus into thirty
books, of which two- thirds were written in
hexsuieter verse, and the rest in the iambic
end hochsic mensures.

‘⁸ To wipe s man’s nose for him, is to imply
that he is a driveller who cannot ‹lo it for
himself, snd hence it means to ‘outwit' and
to ‘cheat' him’' (Long in loco). Others

HORATII FLAGGI

Tardius adveniens vitiatum commodius quam

Integrum edax dominus consumeret.

Hos utinam inter

Heroas natum tellus me prima tulisset Ξ
Das aliquid famae quae carmine gratior aurem

Occupet humanam : grandes rhombi patinaeque

Grande ferunt una cum damno dedecus; adde

Iratum patruum, vicinos, te tibi iniquum,
Et frustra mortis cupidum, cum deerit egenti

As laquei pretium.

Jurgatur verbis ; ego vectigalia magna

Divitiasque habeo tribus amplas regibus.” Ergo
Quod superat non est melius quo insumere possis?

Gur eget indignus quisquam te divite ἓ

Templa ruunt antiqua deum?

Non aliquid patriae tanto emetiris acervo ἓ

it was high, in case a strangen- should drop
in to eat of it with them. Horace was a
‘laudator temporis acti,' and in respect at
least to simplicity of social and domestic
habits there is no doubt he was right. How
far he was sincere in the wish that bursts
forth in v. 93 is perhaps doubtful. He
himself suggests the doubt (S. 7. 23), and
he probably knew his own mind.

93. tellus me prima] See S. i. 3. 99.

94. Dae aliquid famae] ‘ 1 suppose you
have some consideration for your character!

95. patinaeque] The ⁴ patina' was a
covered dish in which ments were brought
in hot from the kitchen. ‘ Patruus ' was as
proverbial a name for tyranny on the male
side of the family as ‘ noverca ’ on the fe-
male. See C. iii. 12. 3, and Cicero pro Cael.
ll ; “ Fuit in hac causa pertristis quidam
patruus, censor, magister.’' S. ii. 3. 87.

99. As laquei pretium] This was a
proverb, or became so. See Lucian (Tim.
c. 20): ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ πολλοὺς ἂν εἰπεῖν
ἔχοιμί σοι χθὲς μὲν οὐδὲ ὄβολον’ ὥστε πρία-
σθαι βρόχον“ εσχηκότας, ἄφνω δὲ τήμερον
πλουσίους καὶ πο λυτελεῖς. Τ110 old read-
ing ‘aes‚’ as Orelli observes, dest-roys the
proverb. Of Trausius the spendthrift no-
thing is known. All we have to infer is,
that 110 lived proflisely upon small means
and ruined himself, which the speaker con-
siders himself too rich ever to do. ‘Vec-
tigalia ’ is used for a private fortune in C.
iii. 16. 40. Its use is appropriate here in
connexion with‘ regibus!

103. ἰητίίρηω] This has the same sense

as ‘immeritus ¹ (C. iii. 6. 1, and elsewhere),
‘innocent.’ Forcell. gives other examples.
Orelli inquires why Horace, who professes
(C. i. 34. l) tohavebeenstthistimecare-
less about religion, should reproach the rich
man with letting the temples go to ruin.
He suggests, as the answer, that Horace
speaks as a man of taste, and that he la-
1110111οᾶ the decay of the temples as a spec·
tator rather than a worsffipper, as more in·
terested in the beauty of the city than in
the honour of the gods. But if Horace
was not so piously disposed as this fit of
zeal for the temples might seem to show,
he knew the value of religion as a politica!
instrument, and that the neglect of sacred
rites went hand in hand with civil disorders.
We can hardly suppose Augustus and 'ri-
berius to have been influenced by much
higher motives thau these when they ap-
plied themselves to the restoration of the
sacred buildings, which during the civil wass
had fallen so much into ruin. See c.ii. 15, ‚⁷
Introduction, and note 011 C. iii. 6. 1.'

106. Um· nimirum] The praefical good
sense of Horace's writings causes that his
language may often be illustrated by words
from Scripture (where human nature is
touched in all its features) more frequently
than I hav‘e cared to illustrate it, for obvious
reasons. “He hath said in his heart 1 shall
not be moved, for 1 shall never be in ad-
versity” (Ps. x. 6), is very like the argu-
ment Horace puts 111 his rich man’ s mouth,
the man whose fortune was large enough
for three kings. Bentley spoils the senti-

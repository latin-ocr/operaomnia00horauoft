SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 7. 525

SATIRE VII.

The substance os this Satira Horace puts into the mouth of his slave Davus, giving
him h‘berty tn express himself as he pleases on the day of the Saturnalia, when much
licence was granted to slaves in particular. Davus takes advantage of the permission
given him to abuse his master, and to taunt the rich with a slavery (to their passions and
to flio world) hardel· and more stupid than his own. He also taunts Horace with his
insffiility and weakness of purpose, which part of the Sauro appears to me to be the
mostnaturaland amusing (see noteonv.23).'1'he rest contains a great deal that is
disagreeable and much that is common· place. It may perhaps represent the habit of
talking trash under the name of philosophy, which those who pretended to be of the Stoic
school had established, and the humour would be moro perceptible to a Roman of the
- day than it is now. The commentators speak highly of its wit, but most of them make
little distinction, and praise all alike.

Themis no trace of a date in the Satire, but some think it probable that as S. 3 was
written at one Saturnalia, and this makes mention of the same festival, and touchae like
the other upon Stoic doctrines, it was perhaps written a year aster the above. Ι do not
see any force in this, nor doae it appear necessary to suppose the Satire was written at or
near the Saturnalia. That way of introducing the subject might have suggested itself at

any time of the year.

ARGUMENT.

1 have beenlong a listener, O my master, and though 1 long to saya few words, Ι know
my position, and am afraid.

Ia that Davus ?

Bven so, Davus your inditia-ent good slave.

Weil, it’s the Saturnalia: you may speak.

There are some men who are consistent in vice ; others who are always hovering between
right and wrong. There’s Priscus, a inan who changes every hour from the fop to the
plain man, from the stately to the humble, from the rake to the philosopher, the very
type of mutability. While Volanerius the gamester, when he could no longer hold the
dice-box for the gout, hired a boy to do it for him. But he in his cons'stency was
better off than the other man in his inconsistency.

What does all this referto, γοα rascal?

To you.

What do you mean, scoundrel?

Why you profess to praise the good old times, but wouldn't go back to them if you
might. In the town you pine for the country, in the country γοα cry up the town.
Is you are not invited out you pretend you are glad to stay at home3 if an invitation
comes, off you fly and leave your poor gne-ts in the lurch3 gluttons they are no doubt,
but are you less so yourself. ²

Suppose 1 should prove that you are sillier even than me your slave? Don' t be angry,
and I will teu you what I have picked up at the philosopher’ s.

This man goae after his neighbour' s wife, 1 aster a common woman, which of us deservea
most to be hanged? 1 incur no disgrace and no danger. Yon are obliged to put on
all soris of disguises, trembling with a mixture of lust and sear. Why you might aa
well go hire yourself for a gladiator as submit to be tucked into a box to esoepe an
angry husband. You are much worse than the woman γοα seduce, and desen-ve a

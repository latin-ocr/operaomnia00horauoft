HORATII FLAGOI

(v. 199.) “ Let me be free from the squalor of poverty, and I care not whether¹ 1 be
embarked in a big ship or a little: if the gale of prosperity does not fin full my mil,
the foul wind of adversity does not accompany my course. I maybe last of those who
are first, but Ι am ever abead of those who are last. You are no miser? Go to ε is

a all?
Zinient to see life passing from you?
good ?

Are γοα free from ambition, fear of death, passion, superstition? Are *you
Does age find you more forgiving, amiable, and

What is the use of removing but one thorn out of⁴ many? If you cannot live

well, give place to those who can: γοα have eaten, and drank, and played enough.
It is time you depart, lest younger wantons mock and drive you from the scene.''

ann, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,

Si quis forte velit puerum tibi vendere natum

Tibure vel Gabiis, et tecum sic agat : ‘⁶ Hic et

Candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos

Fiet eritque tuus nummorum· millibus octo, ⁵
Verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus heriles,

Litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti

Cuilibet; argilla quidvis imitaberis uda;

Quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti ε

Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo

ἰο

Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces.
Res urget me nulla3 meo sum pauper in aere.

l. Flore, bono claroque] See Introduc-
tion, and as to the character of Tiberius see
Epp. i. 9. 4, n. His name was that of his
father, Tiberius Claudius Nero, till his adop-
tion by Augustus, Aa). 4, when he became
Tib. Claudius Nero Caesar.

2. natum Tibure vel Gabiis‚] That is,
⁴ any where you please! ‘⁴ Poetis⁴ certa ima-
gine opus est ;'’ the poets like to give reality
to their illustrations by being specific. This
is Dillenburger’s remark, and I agree with
him. Orelli thinks Italian towns are men-
tioned with reference to the fact of the
slave being a ⁴ verna’ (Epod. ii. 65, n.).

As to Gabii, see Epp. i. 11. 7, n.

5. nummorum millibus octo‚] About
651. sterling. Much lai-ger sums were given
for handsome slaves, and this boy’s accom-
plishments, if they were real, would make
him worth a good price. There would be
reason therefore to suspect in such a case
that the owner was anxious to get rid of
him. (See S. ii. 7. 43, n.) The ‘literati’
were a separate class in the slave family,
and were subdivided into ‘anagnostae ’ or
⁴ lectores ⁹ (who read to their masters, chiefly
at their meals, or if their masters were
authors they read their productioris aloud
for the benefit of the guests), and ‘ librarii '
or ‘ scribae,' used for writing from dictation,

taking care of the library, keeping accounts, Α

&c., and hence called ⁴ pueri' or ‘ servi a stu-
diis,’ ‘ ab epistolis: ‘ a bibliotheoess ⁴ notarii,'
διο. There were also architecta, sculptor-s,
painters, engravers, and other afleta, who
all came under the same general houd of
‘ literati! ΤΙιο boy in this place might also
be put among the ⁸ cantores ' or ¹ sympho-
niaci,' the choir or band who sang and
played to their master at meals. In short,

he was fit for any of the above employment· , ’γ

according to his owner's estimate; which he
professes to put in a modest way, for sear he

should seem to be puffing his property, and Ϊ

so depreciate its value.
12. meo sum pauper in aera] ⁸ Aee
alienum ' is used for a debt, and ⁴ nes pro-

prium' ⁴ suum,' &c. is therefore money not

horrowed. Cicero opposes them (in Verr.

ii. 4. 6): “At hominem video auctionem

fecisse nullam; vendidisse praeter fructus

suos nihil unquam; non modo in aere alieno ' ω
nullo, sed in suis nummis multis esse ot . 2

semper fuisse.” “Aes alienum ut quod

nos aliis debemus3 aes suum est- quod alii ⁷ ²-

nobis debent'' (Dig. 50. 16. 213, quoted
by Mr. Long on the foregoing passage).
The man here says he is not rich, but what
he has is his own.

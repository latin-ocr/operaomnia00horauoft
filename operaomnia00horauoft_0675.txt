have praised good wine if he had not liked it; and as for father Ennius, he never began
to sing till he was drenched. As soon as ever I issued my edict that the Forum was
only fit for the sober, and that song was not for the serious, straightway all our poets
began to drink night and day. But what, shall 8 111811 look stern and go 11818-1001811
81111 with scanty toga, like Cato, and then think he is imitating Cato’ s virtues? Iar-
bitas broke 1118 118811 with envy of Timagenes, and tried in vain to be elegant and
eloquent as 118.

any chance were to look pale, they would all 118 18111113 cummin to make them look so

measure but not the subjects and fierce spirit of Archilochus, even as Alcaeus and
Sappho mingled 1118 measures but not his temper with their own. I then was the first
to make him known to my countrymen3 and it is my delight that the good read
and handle what Ι have written. But why do any read me greedily 81 1101118 81111 only
go abroad to abuse me? Because Ι do not condescend to canvass the critics and buy
their approbation. This is what annoys them. And if 1 say, “ 1 care not that my
poor verses should be recited to crowded audienoes ;” ‘⁴ Oh! you mock us,” say they,
“and are keeping your fine things for ears divine3 for of course honey only comes
from your hive: you are the only fine gentleman, in your own eyes.” 1 am afraid 10
181011, 80 I only say, “I don't like your ground, and beg a postponement of the
sport ;” for such sport only leads to wrath‚ and wrath to fighting and bloodshed.

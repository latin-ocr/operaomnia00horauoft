436 HORATII FLAGOI SATIRARUM Ι. 10.

with him. Τ115 epithet ¹ turgidus’ applies to his person, and is explained by the desa-ip-
tion given of himin the above place,‘ ‘pingui tentus omaso! 'He is said to have murdered
Memnon, and it is generally said that this refers to a translation he is supposed· to have
made of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, one of the cyclic poets, in which Memnon was one of
the principal heroes. Dacier suggests that he wrote a tragedy with this title, to which
notion the following lines give some probability. Horace says that Furius, like some
rude artists, had made a figure of Rhenus with a head of clay, referring to the statues by
which the different river gods were represented, and to some description this poet had
given of the sources of the Rhine, probably in the above poem on the Gallic war. There
is a very different representation of Rhenus on 3 medai of Drusus, in Oiselius’ Thesaurus,
Pl. 24. 6, where he appears as a majestic figure, reclining with his lest arm resting on his
111-11, and in his right hand a reed partly broken; which latter symbol appearsto have been
familiar to Ovid, for he writes, desei-ibing the triumph of Tiberius, Λα). 12 (ex Pont. 111.

‘Defingo’ is to fashion out, and differs little from* fingo? ‘diffingo’ (C. 1. 35. 39, 11.) 15 to
break up and fashion anew. Nevertheless some MSS. and editions have‘ diffingit’ here.
Dillenbr. says this word‘ ‘haud dubie reprehensionem continet ut simile verbum de·
formare. ’' Ι do not agree with him. If‘ deformare’ were substituted it would either
have the same meaning that 1 have given to ‘defingit,' or it would signify disfigurd,
which sense the passage will not bear. There is a chapter in Gellius (xviii. ll) in which
he defends Furius from the adverse judgment of Caesellius Vindex, who pronounoed him
affected, and said he had spoilt the Latin tongue by the invention of new words, of some
of which he gives specimens. The heading of the chapter makes this Furius to be Aulus
Furius of Antium 3 but as he was a poet held in high esteem, and one whom virgil largely
imitated (see Macrob. Saturn. vi. 1), it has been assumed that “ Furii Antiatis,'’ in the
lemma to Gellius' chapter, is 3 corrupt reading (Weichert, Poet. Lat. p. 350 sqq.). What-
ever the merits of Furius of Antium may have been, it is possible he may have used the
expressions Gellius quotes, and they would not be more or worse blemishes than one
might find in most poems of the same length (his Annals extended to upwards of eleven
books) ; and I see no good reason for supposing Furius Bibaculus to be meant. It is
curious however that one of the affectations ascribed to the poet Gellius refers to, is
‘⁸ quod terram in lutum versam ¹ lutescere' dixerit.'' IfBibaculus were the author of
this expression we might imagine that it had stuck to his name, and that Horace uses the
expression ‘luteum caput' as referring to this proverbial reproach. What else is known of
him will be found in his life in the Dict. Biog. ς the author of which notice thinks Horace
might have shown more respect and forbearance towards the aged Furius. He aux-ibes
his ridicule to various possible motives, principally perhaps tothe circumstance that Fmius'
writings “were stuffed with insults against the Caesars'' (see Tacit. Ann. iv. ³4), and
Catullus he thinks incurred Horace's hostility for the same reason. But Camllus is only
once mentioned in Horace, and there no hostility is shown towards him (see above v.
19, n.). And if Furius was so abusive in his attacks upon Augustus, Horace’s panon and
friend, there would have been no cause for surprise if he had handled him more severely
than he has done. But Augustus, like Julius Caesar, passed over those sort of attacks
with contempt, and we need not suppose Horace was much influenced by them ; though ¹
we may believe that the opponents of the Caesar-s would be among the most prominent of
Horace's detractors, to whom he is here replying.

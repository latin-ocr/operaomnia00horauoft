does Bentley, and it appears in nearly all
mdern editions. Torrentius conjectured
it, but did not think it would make good

or it may be taken, as Torrentius under-
stands it, for any plain- judging man. Many
suppose Horace means himself. Orelli does
so. There is a good passage in Cicero (de
Legg. i. 14) containing the same sentiment
as we find here· “Quod si poena, si metus
supplicii non ipsa turpitudo deterreret ab
injuriosa facinorosaque vita. nemo est in-
justus, et incauti potius habendi sunt quam
improbil' διο. Gellius has a chapter on
this subJect (xii. ll), and quotes some wise

the Forum, and looks up to when he speaks
in the courts. “Gaude qnod t oculi
te mille loquentem'’ (Epp. 6. 19). There
were three principal ‘'fora in Rome in
which judicial and other public as well as
mercantile business m carried on. Tuo
Forum Romanum was called simply Forum
because it was the largest, and till the timo
of Julius Caesar the only one. The dictator
began the erection of another adjoining the
Forum Romanum, and it was called aster
him ι “ Forum de manubiis inchoavit, cujus
area super HS millies constitit '' (Sueten.
Caes. 26). It was finished by Augustus,
as appears from the Monumentum Ancy-
ranum: “ rouvu Jvmvu Εἰ· assumant

causa fuit hominum et judiciorum multitudo
quae videbatur, non sufficientibus duobus,

Elsewhere Suetonius says it was of no great
extent: “Forum angustius fecit, non ausus
extorquere possessoribus proximas domos”

(c.56).1n this ‘'forum none but judicial
business was transacted. The allusJions to
the Forum Augusti are common. Servius

tue (see C. S. 58, n.), and lay in action3
and with them the perfectiori of virtue was
tho perfecn'on of happiness, utility, wealth,
power-(see below, v. 106, n.:‘) ‘Zeno igitur
nullo modo is erat qui ut Theophrastus
nervos virtutis inciderit, sed eontra qui

,omnnqmeadbeatam vitam pertineantin

una virtute poneret„ nec quidquam aliud
numeru-et in bonis '¹ (Cic. Ac. Prior. 10).

18. Nm ιἰι Aristippi] After holding
for a time ιο the rigid school of virtue and
the Stoica, hc insensibly went over to the
hx doctrines of the Cyrenaioe, whose
founder was Aristippus of Cyrene, one of
Socrates’ least worthy disciploe. He held
that every man should control circum-
stances and not be controlled by them.
Hence he did not hedtate to expose himself
to the temptations, and once when
he was blamed for keeping company with
Lais, the courteoan, his reply was, ἔχω
Δαΐδίι ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἔχομαι (compare Diog
laert-iv. 66, 68, 75). An instance ofhis
indifference in another way is given above
(S. ii. 3. 1⁰0), when he told his slave who was
oerrying a bag of money and was tired, to
thr-ow away some of it to lighten his load.
Another story of the same sort is given by
Cicero (de Invent. ii. 58), that he threw his
money into the sea. But his object then
was ιο save his life. In Epp. 17. 23 we
have-—

‘⁴ Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status
Τοιῖὲεἷιῗζιιι majora fere praesentibus

aequum.”

> Plutarch says he was able ὥσπερ ἐπὶ ζύγου

πρὸς τὰ βελτίονα τῶν ὑποκειμένων ἐξ·
αναφέρειν καὶ ἀνακουφίζεσθιιι αὐτόν (De
Tranq. An. 8); and Diog. (ii. 66), ἣν δὲ
ἱκανὸς ἁρμόσασθαι καὶ τόπῳ καὶ χρόνῳ
καὶ προσώπῳ, καὶ πᾶσαν περίστασιν
Ἠῖζῖἓιὺἔὲοἱῗζέῖὶθᾜᾱ ἷῗοῖἰὲ ζῖῗζὲ
time a want of practical strictness in
these views, they in theory recognized
aelf-connobur- temperance and contentment,
as the basis of happiness. But while Aris-
tippus inculcated sels· reliance and content·
ment, requiring all care for the future to be

20

dismissed, and the thoughts and desires to
be confined to the present moment, he
brought in the notion that present pleasure
was the only happiness, and this doctrine is
associated with the Cyrenaic school. Comm.
Cruq. explains‘ ‘Et mihi res,’ '&.c, clearly,
saying,⁸ ‘Rebus utor ita ιιι eis imperem non
autem ιιι eis serviam, ιιι avarus. '¹ But
Aristippus departed from his own theory
when he de from the rule of his
teacher and took money from his pupils.
He was the first of the Socratics that did. so,
and Xenophon is supposed ιο refer to him,
when he says that some of Socrates' dis-
ciploe got for nothing a little of his wisdom
and sold it at a high price to others (Mem.
i. 2, 5 60). Th0se that took money from
their disciples Socrates said sold themselves ·

into slavery, and he must therefore have

‚held this opinion of Aristippus (lb. § 6).

His dialogus with Socrates (in Xen. Mem.
ii. l) throws light upon his opinions as herc
stated by Horace. The word ¹ subjungere'
is plainly taken from putting the neck of
beasts os burthen under the yoke.

2⁰. diesque Lonya] Here Bentley reads

‘Lenta‚' ‘¹ quo seilicet Horatium ipsum
emendet,'’ as Baxter says. The change of
word weakens the force of the verse.

21. ut piyer annus Pupillis] Every boy
who had lost his father was under a ⁴ tutor'
or guardian in respect of his property, while
the care of his person belonged to his
mother, or, in the ease of her death, to his
nearest relation, provided he was not a
‘pupillus' himself. This lasted till the
age of puberty (fourteen). The boy was a
ιριιρὶῌιιε,1 ιιοι in relation to his mother,
but to his tutor, who might be appointed
by the mother if she had by the father's
will ⁴ tutoris optionem) and if that ¹ optio ’
was ‘plena ' she might change the tutor as
often as she pleased3 if it was ⁶
the number of times she was allowed to
change was limited by the will. In the
former case her guardianship might be
¹dura,' oppressive and mischievous, as of
course it might be in many other ways if
she were an unnatural mother ; but Horace
means that it was irksome to boys, beoeuse
they wished to be their own masters.
‘ Tutores ' were only chosen by the mother

beautiful passage). Silius (xii. 543) makes
Ilia hide herself in the bosom of her sponse
as Hannibal approaches the Anio. That
there were two legends therefore, in this as
in most cases, must be admitted. Cru-
quius' commentator gets rid of the difficulty
in true Scholiast fashion by saying that
Ilia was buried by the banks of the Anio,
which carried her remains away and washed
them into the Tiber; and hence she was said
to have been married to the Tiber. Servius
(on Aen. i. 277) remarks on Horace’s version,
which he says is supported by other writers.
claudian is one. Speaking of the Tiber he
says,
“ Palla graves humeros velat quam neverat
uxor
Ilia, percurrens vitreas sub gurgite telas.’'

(In Prob. et Olyb. Cous. 224.) Jove may
be supposed to have disapproved the pre-
sumption of the river-god, because he had
reserved the task of expiation for other
hands and happier means.

21. cives acuisse serrum] ‘inter se’ or
‘in semetipsos ' is readily understood.
Mitscherlich and others make ‘ audiet acu·
isse' a prophecy, ⁴ shall hear them sharpen,'
whereas it should be rendered ‘shall hear
of their having sharpened.’ Horace is not
predicting what is to be, but lamenting
what has been. .

Persians, Medos, and Parthiam are names

ι freely interchanged by Horace. The growth
of the Parthian power from the condition
of an insignificant dependency to the ab·
sorption of nearly the whole of the vast
empire of the Seleucidae, is a question of
history which need not be entered upon
here. It will be borne in mind however
with reference to the above confusion of
names that the Parthian empire, at the
time Horace wrote, extended nearly from
the Indus to the Roman province of Syria;
and that the Parthians were in the habit of

making incursions into that province, which
fact is referred to in the last stanza of this
ode. Although the name of Aug-ustus, assist-
ed by their own disputes, did something to.
wards keeping them in check, they were
held by the Romans to be their most fur—
midable enemies, as the readers of Home
will easily perceive. Augustus meditated
but never carried out war with the Parthians,
and the Romans never till the “reign of
Trajan gained any successes against them.
Their empire was broken up and suoeeoded
by the Persian kingdom of the Snesanidao
during the reign of Alexander Severus, ω.

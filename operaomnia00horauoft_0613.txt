32 A modern writer (Swinburne, i. 163)
writes that Alp honsus 1. enclosed eighteen
miles of the country near Foggia in Puglia
(Apulia) with toils, and took so many stags,
that besides what was taken away by the
hunters, he sent 400 head to be salted for
the use of the garrisons of Treui and Bar-
letta. These toils were ‘ plagae! The
‘venabulum' was a long hunting
such as hog-hunters use in India, with a
barbed point. Such an one is oerried by
one of the centaurs in the picture of tue
lion and centaurs found in the tragic poet's
house at Pompeii. Virgil (Aen. iv. 131),
desoeibing the hunting-party of Aeneas and
Dido, says, —

“Retia rara, plagae, lato venabula ferro,

Massylique ruunt equites et odora oenum

59 Differ-tum transire sorum populum-

⁸qne] Because ‘differtum ' does not suit

‘populum,’ and because ⁴ populo ' occurs in
the next verse. Bentleyhas put in ‘cam-
pumque ' for ⁴ populumque’ out of his own
head. There is no difficulty in the text,
which is that of all the MSS. It is useless
ton-gne against a reading so purely arbi-
trary. The editor who could not only sug-
gest an alteration, but take it into the text
the reading υἱὲ
‘a

MSS. and previous editions, with·
in malam rem inficeta lectio‘ populumquef’

is not to be argued with. Obbarius says

“contra Bentleium egometipse pluribus
disputavi in ed. Schmidii, p. 159‚” to which
I refer my readers ifthey care for such dis-
cussion.

61. erudi tumidique lavernam] It would
seem that some gluttons, with the idea of
renewing their appetite, went to bathe im·
mediately aster dinner as well as (which
was the general practice) immediately be-
fore. It can hardly be supposed that under

Persius (iii. 98) says ¹‘ Turgidus hic epulis
atque albo ventre lavatur,” and then goes
on to describe the man carried away from
table in a fit of apoplexy. Compare J uve-
nal (i. 14·. ‘): —

“Poena tamen praesens quum tu deponis

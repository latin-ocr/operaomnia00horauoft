18. αἱρεῖ] The MSS. and editors here

again are divided between‘ eximet’ and

‘exiget’ Inter editors prefer the latter,
and it appears to me more forcible and
appropriate. (Seec. iii. 1⁴. 14, ιι.)

23. Seres—Tanain] Seec.iii. 29. 27,ιι.
The Seres and Indi are not much dis-
tinguiahed by Horace (see C. i. 12. 56), and,
when he is referring to the East, their namoe
ane generally aaeodated with the Parthians,
more for the sake of amplification than with
historica! or geographica aomraey. The
Roman armiae had not yet even maed
the Tigris. But when Augustus was in

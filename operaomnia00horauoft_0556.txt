526 HORATII FLAGOI

heavier punishment. If you get out of the serape, of course you’ll take care not to get
into it again. Not a bit. You will seek the first opportunity to renew your ten-ors
and your punishment. Do you call yourself my master, you whom no emancipatiou
could free from bondage? Ι am your vicarius if you please, or your fellow-slave.
You are but a puppet, and your passions the strings that work it.

Who then is free ἓ Η8 who has command over himself, who can bid defiance to his lusts,
and look down upon honours, who is complete in himself and proof against the rubs
of the world and of fortune. Do you recognize yourself here? Why your mistress
cheats you, dismisses, recalls you, and you cannot get your neck out of the yoke3 and
yet you cry, I am freel Then you let your senses be run away with by a sane picture3
and while poor Davus is abused if he stops for a moment to look at a daub in the
streets, you are a connoisseur forsooth. I am good for nothing if Ι am tempted with
a cake piping hot. Are you more master of your appetite? Why am 1 worse than
you? Your food will soon turn sour 011 your stomach, and your legs refuse to carry
you. Which is worst‚ the slave who steals a seraper and gives it for a bunch'of ἕτεραι,
01· the master who sells his lands to seed his belly? And-then you can't live in your-
self, but are always running away from care like a slave from his lord; but he follows
you, go where you will.

Give me a stone.

What for? are you mad?

Be off with you, or I’ll send you to work in the fields forthwith.

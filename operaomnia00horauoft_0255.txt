CARMEN IV.

A.u.c. 739.

'l'liehistcry ofthis odeis easilymade out. TheVindeliciwereatribe whom teriton'es
lay between the Danube and the lake of Constanoe, comprising the greater part of
modern Bavaria and Suabia, and some part of the Tyrol. The Raeti lay to the south
of the Vindelici, and reached to lake eomo on the south. These tribes, whom the
historiam describe as very fierce and warlike, commenced a system of predatory incur-
aionsintoCisalpine Gaul, inwhichtheyappeartohavepractisedthegreatestatro-
ἀίξαι (Dion Cass. liv. 22; Strobos iv. 6). Augustus was at this time (A.u.c. 738-39)
in Transalpino Gaul, and 'liberius was with him. Drusus, his step-son, and younger brother
of merim, was Quaestor at Rome, and in his twenty-third'year. He was required by
Augustus to take the field against the ofl'ending tribes, whom he met under the 'lh-identine
Alps and defeated signally. But though driven from Italy they continued their attacks
upon Gaul, and Tiberius was accordingly sent by Augustus with more troops to his ’
brother& assistance, and they between them effectually humbled the tribes, whose terri-
toties were constituted a Roman province under the united name οἱ Raetiae, Raetia
Prima, or Proper, and Secunda, which embraoed the possessions of the Vindelici: these
alno comprised several other tribes, of whom Horace particularly mentions the Genauni
and Breuni. The whole of this war took place in the spring and summer of the year
mii-o. 739, and weare led to suppose from C. iv. 1⁴. 34—38, that it was brought to a con-
clusion in the month of August on the anniversary of the capture of Alexandria by
Augustus in the year 724 (C. i. 37, Introduction). In honour of these victoria Horace

’ composed this ode and the fourteenth of this book, the one more expressly to celebrate
the name of Drusus, the other of Tiberius. The two odae·thorefore must historically be
viewed together. Whether they were written while the wars were yet fresh, or on the
return of Augustus to Romeinthe year A. u. c. 741, is doubted· but I incline to think
they were written at different times, and should rather, from the character of the odes
themselves, infer that the first was written immediately on the tidings of Drusus’ victory
before his brother joined him3 and that the second, which has much less spirit in it, was

· composed on Augustus' return and by his desire, as a supplementtothe first. The popu.
lnity of Drusus and the hopes that were entertained of him would create much enthu-
n'asm at Rome on the occasion ofhis successes in his first campaign, and there is a hearty
and vigorous tone about the fourth ode which does not appear so conspicuously in the
fourteenth. Here the praises οἱ Drusus are uppermost in the poet’s mind, there Augus-

ξ’ Nevertheless 1 agree with Franke in thinking it improbable Horace would have written
³.- tho fourth odo without on allusion to Tiberius, if his victorias io conjunctim: with his
ἱ brother had taken place, or been known at Rome when he composed it. Tbere is indeed
tacit reference to Tiberius in v. 28; but not more than was unavoidable in alluding to
Augustus aa the fountain of those virtues which appeared in Drusus. Not to have
dlnded to merlus would have been as unnatural as to have omitted a more specific

GARMINUM IV. 4. 227

Venti paventem, mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus,
Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae ε
Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta fulvae matris ab ubere
J am lacte depulsum leonem
Dente novo peritura vidit:
Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici ;-—quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi
Dextras obarmet quaerere distuli,
Nec seire fas aet omnia. ;—sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae
Consiliis juvenis revictae

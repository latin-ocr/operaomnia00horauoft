SATIRARUM Ι. 1.

Furtim defossa timidum deponere terra?
‘⁴ Quod si comminuas vilem redigatur ad assem.”
At ni id fit quid habet pulchri constructus acervus?

Milia frumenti tua triverit area centum,

Non tuus hoc capiet venter plus ac meus: ut si
Reticulum panis venales inter onusto
Forte vehas humero, nihilo plus accipias quam

Qui nil portarit.

mere proverbial way of speaking, common
toalllanguages. Noobstaclesaretoo
great for a man who has a selfish purpose
to serve, if he has set his heart upon it.
The second person is used to give force to
the language. The sels-deceiver is con-
fronted with his own illustration.

thisbelongs onlyto ‘defossa’ 1 rather doubt
it. ‘Defessa deponere terra ’ cannot be
taken too closely together, as Dillenbr.
jnstly remarks.

43. Quod si comminuas] Τὴο miser is
sup to interrupt, and say, “but if
you were to take from it, it would soon
dwindle to a paltry ‘as.’ ’' Bentley and
others put a comma aster ‘ quod,’ and make
the same person speak the whole. Though
‘ quod ’ is always the neuter of the relative,
whether it be translated ‘that,’ ⁴ because,’
or ‘but,' here it is ‘⁸ used to connect a new
sentence with what precedes ’¹ (Key's L. G.
1454, i), and is not connected with ⁴ pondus ’
as its antecedent.

45. Miliasrumenti] ⁴ Modiorum’ must
be supplied. As to ⁴ millia,' ‘ mille,’ see S.
ii. 3. 197, n. On ‘area‚' see C. i. 1.18, n.
‘Triverit,' ‘ suppose that it thraehes) On
this concessive use of the subjunctive, see
Key’s L. G. 1227, b. The practice of put-
ting a note of interrogation in such sen-
tenues as this is exploded. The older edi-
tions generally have it. See Cic. in Verr.
Act. ii. 1. 3. c. 2: “Furem aliquem aut
rapacem accusaris: vitanda tibi semper erit
omnis avaritiae suspicio,'’ &c., with Long's
note and Heindorfs on this passage. Simi-
lar constructione. are S. 10. 64: “Fuerit
Lucilius inquam Comis et urbanus3 fuerit
limatior—sed ille,” &c. S. 3. 15: “De-
cies centena dedisses :—quinque diebus nil
ent in loculis.'' Epp. i. 1. 87: “Lectus
genialis in aula est; Nil ait esse prius melius,
nil coelibe vita.’' Epp. i. 6. 29: ‘⁵ Vis recte
vivere: quis non ?’' v. 31, “virtutem verba
putes ut lucum ligna ε cave ne portus occu-
pet alterss’ Horace uses ‘ hoc’ for ‘ propter
hanc rem' in other places. S. i. 3. 93:

Vel dic quid referat intra

“Minus hoc jucundus amicus Sit mihi?''
9. 7, “Hie ego, Pluris hoc mihi semper
eris.” See the passage of Cicero quoted ou
v. 25. Lambinus says that ‘hoc is to be
taken δεικτικῶς, ‘by so much,' “verbi
gratia, pilo et similibus.”

with him.

⁴ Plus ac' (rather than ⁴ quam,'
which was the reading of all the editions
except Bersmann's till Bentley, but with
little or much less MS. authority) occurs
again S. i. 6. 130, “victurum suavius ac si.”
S. i. 10. 34, “ non ligna feras insanius ac
si.'’ S. i. 10. 59, “Mollius ac si quis.”
S. ii. 3. 270, “Nihilo plus explicet ac si
Insanire paret.’' Cicero likewise uses ⁴ ac'
with the comparative (Ad Att. xiii. 2),
‘¹ Diutius abfuturus ac nollem.’' See Key's
L. G. ξ 1439. *Plus quam' occurs im·
mediately below. The scene that follows is
that of a rich man’s household preceding
him to the country, a pack of slaves (venales),

and others with different burthens, and
some with none at all. Thte man who car-
ried the bread would not get any more of it .

on that account when the rations were given
out, but all would share alike.

49. Quid restrae—viventia This is a
very natural construction, and I do not un-
derstand Orelli's difficulty about it. ‘ Rs-
fert' is ‘ rem fert’ (Key's L. G. 910), and
the construction ‘ mea,' ¹ tua,' &c.‚ ‘refert,’
is no more, as Professor Key shows, than a
corruption of ‘ meam,’ ⁴ tuam,' δια, ‘rem
fert! So ‘magni refert' is ‘rem magni
fert,' ‘it brings with it a matter of great
price,’ and ‘ refert viventi' signifies ‘it
brings something that concerns him who
lives‚' that is, it affects him, and ‘ quid re-
fert' is ‘ wherein does it affect him ?’ The
bounds of natm-e can only be explained re-
latively. Artificial wants are natural wants
in some conditions of life, but this second
nature also hm its limits, which there are
few that do not transgress who can. The
man who can live upon the produce of an
hundred acres might live upon fisty and still

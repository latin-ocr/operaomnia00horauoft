allowed to be very loose. The translator of Buttmann's article in the cmbfidge Philo-
logical Museum (May, 1832) destroys his theory completely by saying, “ there can be
little doubt too that Horace was also thinking of the omen of Lucius Tarquinius: the
image and the expressions

the story ; and, though Livy calls the bonnet a ‘ pileus,’ Cicero (de Legg. i. 1) uses the
very word ‘ apex.’ '’ It is not probable that Horace meant to allude ω both these
historical facts together, but more likely that 118 intended neither the 0118 nor the otha-3
and that the ‘ dilogia ' supposed has been too hastily taken up from Bam, who finds these
double meanings at every turn.

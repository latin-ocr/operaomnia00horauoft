HORATII FLAGCI

J AM jam efficaci do manus scientiae,

Supplex et oro regna per Proserpinae,

Per et Dianae non movenda numina,

Per atque libros carminum valentium

Refixa caelo devocare sidera, q 5
Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris

Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

Movit nepotem Telephus N cresum,

In quem superbus ordinarat agmina

Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat.

Unxere matres Iliae addictum feris
Alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,

1. Jam jam] ΤΙιο repetition denotes
haste and eagerness, ‘ see, see I yield.’
They are said ‘ dare manus ’ who give their
hands to the chains of a conqueror. The
phrase is common enough. SeeVirgil (Aen.
xi. 568): “neque ipse manus feritate de-
disset.’' Caesar (B. G. v. 31): ‘⁴ tandem dat
Cotta permotus mauus; superat sententia
Sabini.'’ Cicero uses it repeatedly. Τῑιθ
speaker invokes Proserpina and Hecate as
the divinities with whom the witch has
most communication.

4. Per atque libros] This position of
‘ atque ' is peculiar to the poets.

5. Refixa] This word, which gives the
only true sense here, has given place in
some respectable MSS. to ‘defixa,' which
has no suitable meaning. Vir-gil says (Aen.
v. 527): “Caelo ceu saepe refixa Trans-
currunt crinemque volantia sidera ducunt.''

7. solve, solve turbium] All the MSS.
have ‘ solve 3’ Lambinus has ‘volve,’ with-
out authority. ‘ Turbo ' is a wheel of some
sort used by sorceresses: ῥόμβος is the
Greek name for it; and Theocritus intro-
duces the witch Simaetha using it, and
saying (ii. 30):—
χὼὂς δινεῖθ’ ὅδε ῥόμβος ὁ χάλκεος ἐξἈφρο-

ιτας
ὡς κεῖνος δινοῒτό ποθ’ ἁμετέρῃσι θύρῃσι. ,

Ovid also (Am. i. 8. 7): “ Scit bene quid gra-
men quid torte concita rhombo Licia ;” and
Propertius (iii. 6. 26) ε “ Staminea rhombi
ducitur ille rota ;’' and Martial (xii. 57):
“Cum secta Colcho Luna vapulat rhomb0.''
Threads of various colours arranged arti-
ficially were spun round the wheel, and
formed a magical web supposed to involve
somehow or other the affections or fortunes
of him who was the object of the spell.
⁴ Retro solvere ' means to relax the onward
motion of the wheel, which will then of

itself roll back. ‘Volvere’ is too obvious-
au emendation, and not required.

8. Movit nepotem] How Telephus, the
king of Mysia, was wounded and aster-warda
healed by Achilles (the son of Tbefis. aud
so grandson of Nereus), is told in the life of
Telephus in Smith’s Dict. Biog. He op-
posed the Greeks on their way to Troy.
Propertius refers to the story (ii. 1. 63) :—

“Mysus-et Haemonii juvenis qua cuspide
ὃθιΞεΞξΞῖ hac ipsa cuspide sensit

See also Ovid (ΤΠ-ει. i. 1. 99, sqq.)=

‘⁴ Namque ea vel nemo, vel qui mihi vulnera
80118111ι lichilleo tollere more poteshf'

11. Unoeere] This is the reading of the
greater number of MSS„ including tho
Blandinian3 also of Cruquius' Scholiasta
who says, “ unxere—sepeliere.” There is
also good authority for ¹ luxere,’ and Bent-
ley warmly defends it; he has no doubt
whatever it is Horace’s word, “ab auctore
profectum esse nullus dubito.'' Lambinus
has a long note in its defenoe, but in his
second edition has ‘ unxere ’ in desa-enee to
the MSS. Bentley says any common paud ’
son might haye thought os ‘unxere, of
‘ luxere' “nemo nisi apprime eruditus.”
I agree with most modern editors in think-
ing ‘unxere ' has more meaning here than
⁸ luxere.' It is Horaee's purpose to show
that Achilles, moved by the entreaties of
Priam (11. xxiv. 510), gave back Hector's
body, which he had threatened the dogs
should devour (11. xxiii. 182). ‘Unxere’
would show that the body had been re-
turned, which ‘lnxere ’ would not. That
Homer does not mention the fact that the
Trojan women anoinoed Hector’s body is au

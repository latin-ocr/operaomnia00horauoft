HORATII FLAGGI

Scriba ex quinqueviro corvum deludet hiantem,

in the sense of ‘interdum' here and else-
where. (See A. P. v. 14 and 95.) For-
cellini only gives examples 01 this meaning
from later writers. The ‘ scribae,’ of whom
an example occurs above (S. i. 5. 35), were
clerks in public 0111888.Τ11888 places were
often gotp by purchase, and the ‘scriba'
received public pay. Nevertheless the
‘quinqueviri' appear from this passage
to have ranked lower than the‘ scribae3'
and Cicero speaks rather contemptuously
of the office 111 1118 Acad. Prior. ii. 44.
They were officers appointed to relieve
the other magistrates at night of the
charge of the city. These were the perma-
nent ‘ quinqueviri ς’ but extraordinary com-
missions of five were 011811 appointed 101·
various purposes. (See Dict. Ant.) The
meaning of ‘recoctus' has been variously
given. The Scholiasts Acron and Comm.
Cruq. make it equivalent to ‘astutusss
⁴ vafer τ’ “ saepe refectus 81 per hoc astutum! '
Porphyrion says it is “iterum scriba factus,''
as 11 1118 111811 11811 been a ⁴ scriba‚’ had be-
come a ⁴ quinquevir‚’ and had returnedto his
former condition again. Some editors take
it as Acron does, though his sense Ι think
is only suggested by the context. Others
(as Lambinus) follow Porph. What the
exact force 01 Ηο1888’8 description is Ι 110
1101 888, whether we take ‘ recoctus ' in the
sense of the last Scholiast, or suppose it
only to mean, as it may, one who having
been a ⁴ quinquevir ' has been transformed
into 8 ‘scribas Perhaps Teiresias means to
say that Coranus, who had got into a situa-
tion 111 which 118 11811 acquired a good deal
of money and some knowledge 01 business,
was too wide awake to be caught in the
snare, saw through the attentions 01 1118
fortune-hunter and laughed at him. The
⁴ corvus hians ' is perhaps taken from
Aesop’s fable of the fox and crow, copied by
Phaedrus (1. 13).

57. Captatur] This word, as ⁴ captare '
above (v. 23), 18 used by Juvenal several
times for this character3 another word used
in the same sense was‘ heredip 818,’ whether
by any classical author but Petronius 1 do
not know. We know nothing more 01 1118

881018 111 11118 story, Nasica and Coranus,
but it appears likely they were living per-
sons and the case well known.

58. Num suris Ι] Ulysses does 1101
understand him, 81111 88118 11 118 18 1181181811,

some to be 811 11081881 ὃιλογίας that is, it
may be taken 88 11 Τ81185185 meant that
whatever 118 58111 was going 10 happen
would happen, and vice vcrsa3 whereas he
maymeauto saythat thereisno certainty
about the issue of the prophecia—they
will happeu or will not, and he does not
know which. Ι 8111 not sure about the

double meaning, and rather think Horace

only meant 10 put a pompous truism into
the mouth 01 1118 prophet. Various altera-
tions have been proposed, but they have
no MS. authority, and 1 need not repeat
them. Orelli has done so in his various
readin .

Horace wrote. He was consul ΑΛ). 3
(Clinton, Γ. H..) Orelli adopts the form

6’ἰοειοε inprefecence to‘ fastusf as being,
heaays, more ancient. ‘Fastibus’ occurs
in Lucan (x. 187), · and Priscian (vi. 14)
says, that both forms have been found by
him in this paoeage of Horace. The words
occur-again in c.iv.14. 4:
mem ue fastos.”

5. ducit] Thisisthereadingof all the
MSS. Heinsius proposedto toread * ducit, '
ιο he gom-ned by‘ genusf and Bentley
warmly supporta that . But there
isnoneceflityto desert the MSS. What
Horace says is nearly as follows, ‘Since, as
it· is reported, your early ancestors declared
they were descended from Imus, and the
amau-ditioni has come down through their
sucoeoecrs in the annals of the family, no
. doubtyoudrawyour origin from that dis·

emphasis, asin C. i. 1. 35,* ‘Quodsime

vatibus* mseris,’ 'where Maecenas is
emphatically addroesed3 aud in C. iv. 2.

rem,” where Julius Antonius is opposed to
Horace himself. ¹ Quando et ' sufficiently

- makes the opposition here.

6. stmiarum] See Introduction.

7. Maricae litoribus] This means the
chore of Minturnae on the bordes-s of Latium
and Campania, where the nymp ph Marica
was worshipped (see Dict. Myth..)

12. aquae—amr] Seebelow, C. iii. 27.
10,* ‘Imbrium divina avis imminentum;
and Ovid (Am-¹ ιί. 6. 34),* ‘pluviae graculus
auctor aquae, ” where it appears Heinsius
proposed ιο substitute‘ augur ’‘for auctor!

13. Dum potis] Bentley, from three of
his oldest MSS.. introduced ythis reading for

‘potes,’ that of former editions. He says

“Per titulos ’

it is “ sine dubio ab Horatii incude: unde
enim bonis illis Librariis nummum tam
ffiggitga—e—P’ And he quooee Virgil (Aen.

“Verum ubi nulla datur dextra adfectare
Ne}0 ptis& lemos fluctus aequare sequeu-
o

To Bentley’s three MSS. Vanderburg has
added a fourth, also of the tenth century,

“et exstitit haud dubie ιιι pluribus aliorum
etiam codd. sed neglectum fuit,'' says Jani,
because he likoe a word‘ ‘tam esquisitum
et rarum! ’1 have followed Orelli* ιιι adopt-
ing ‘potisss but the matter' is doubtful. Y

14. cras Genium mero Gur-abis] ‘Genium
curare' is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. ‘'Placare and

‘indulgere' are the usual words. Mitsch.
says, that‘ ‘any man of politenoss will ιιι-
stinctively see that Horace means politely ιο
offer-himself aa a guestatlnmia’fflstahle'
ou which Orelli says that such pontenaes is
a matter “ de qua vehementer dubitare
licet.” The commentators have with their
usual done their best to determine
whether lamia was going really ιο offer
sam-ifice ιο his genius, or whether Horace
only meant him to do so; and also whether

‘curare ' can have reference ιο a sacrifice,
or whether it dooe not rather mean that
Lamia was going to keep his birthday next
day; to which again it is objected that this
could not be, as blood was not shed' ιιι sam-i-
fice on birthdays ys; of which statement an-
other satisfactorilydisposes (see C. iv. 11.
8, n..) Imayventure ιο leave the reader-
ιο exercise his own judgment on the ques-
tion.

16 operum solutu] This construction,
like“daeinequerelarum” (C. ii.9. 17), and
other ex prassinus there quoted, is similar ιο
the Greek, πόνου λελυμένοις. On these
constructions Prof. Key says (LG. 5 940,

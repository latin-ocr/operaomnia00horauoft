48 HORATII FLAGOI

CARMEN XIX.

Glycera (Γλυκέρα) is one of Horace’s favourite names. She is set down as the Cinara of
C. iv. 13. 21 (see n.), but with what show of reason beyond their having the same number
of syllables, it is not easy to see. We need not take Horace too much at his word when
he says that his days of love were over. Many a young sentimentalist has imagined this
and found himself mistaken as the poet appears to have done. Those who chooseto insist
that Horace is confessing on his own account that ‘⁶ the heyday of his blood was tamed,”
put this ode rather late, A.u.c. 729 or 730. Others find in the allusion to the Parthian
(v. ,12) occasion to fix the date a few years later (734 or 735) when the standards of
Crassus had been recovered from that troublesome enemy. This important epoch is ever
before the minds of one section of the chronologists: ‘⁶ dies noctesque quidam veluti
spectris territi cogitassent de signis et captivis a. 734 a Parthis Augusto redditis,'' says
Franke‚ whose acumen, however, while it has led him on the whole into a more consistent
and probable chronological scheme than Kirchner and others, is not above being mislcd
by too much zeal for its own inventions. 1 should be no more disposed with him to say
Horace wrote this ode while the Arabian expedition (i. 29) was pendiug, than with his

adversaries that he wrote it five or six years later. When or under what circumstances “ 1

or to whom (if any body) he wrote, we must be content to be ignorant. (See C. iv. 1,
Introduction.)

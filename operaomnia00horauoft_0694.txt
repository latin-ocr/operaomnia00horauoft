HORATII FLAGGI

Spectat Roma potens ; habet hos numeratque poetas
Ad nostrum tempus Livi scriptoris ab aevo.
Interdum vulgus rectum videt, est ubi peccat.

Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas

Ut nihil anteferat nihil illis comparet, errat :

Si quaedam nimis antique, si pleraque dure·
Dicere credit eos, ignave multa fatetur,

Et sapit et mecum facit et Jove judicat aequo.
Non equidem insector delendaque carmina Livi

Esse reor, memini quae plagosum mihi parvo

brated poets were performed at first either
on scaffoldings erected in the Circus and
afterwards taken down, or in temporary
wooden theatres‚ usually on a very large
scale3 the notion being that a systematic
encouragement of plays by the erection of
permanent buildings was injurious to pub-
lic morals. The first permanent stone
theatre at Rome (for they had them in the
country towns some time before) was built
by Cn. Pompeius after the Mithridatic war
outside the walls, near the Campus Mar-
tius, on the spot, as is supposed, now called
Campo di Fiore (Cramer). It held 40,000
people. There are no remains of it.
Augustus erected another near the Pons
Fabricius, just outside the walls, to the
memory of his nephew Marcellus (of which
some remains are still visible), and by his
desire a third was built in the' Campus
Martius by L. Cornelius Balbus. It is to
these three, the only theatres of the time,
that Ovid alludes (A. A. iii. 394), ‘⁴ Visite
conspicuis terna theatra locis.’' See also
Suetonius (vit. Aug. 45), “ Per trina theatra
virgis caesum relegaverit'' (Stephanionem,
an actor). For the particulars of a Roman
theatre, see Dict. Ant.

62. Livi scriptoris ab aeva]
Andronicus is spoken of by Quintilian as
the first Roman poet, and without much
respect:—“ Quid erat futurum si nemo
plus effecisset eo quem sequebatur? Nihil
in poetis supra Livium Andronicum, nihil
iu historiis supra Pontificum annales habe-
remus '¹ (x. 2. 7). The date of his birth is
uncertain, but he flourished in the middle
of the third century B.c., and died A.u.c.
533, or thereabouts. His first play was
represented the year before Ennius was
born, A.u.c. 514, as Cicero says on the
authority of Ennius (Brutus, c. 18). He
also says this was the first play put upon

T. Livius

the stage (all before had been extempore
performances). He is said to have been

70

born at Tarentum, which Niebuhr* (iv. 21³0>
says is ‘⁴ probably for no other reason but

because he was confounded with Livius

Macatus, who maintained himself at Taren- , .-

tum ’' (Livy xxiv. 20; xxvii. 34). ‘¹ Livius
Andronicus translated the Odyssey, which,
from its relation to Latium, had greater at-
tractions for the Romans than the Iliad ε
he did not however nansiate the whole of
the Odyssey, but made an abridgement of
it in the national Italian rhythm, and not in
a Greek metre- All that Livius wrote be-
sides his Odyssey are tragedies which, like

the Atellanae, were not performed in stand- ⁴ ⁴

been affirmed that he also wrote comedies
(see his life in Dict. Biog.); and Livy (xxvii.
37) mentions a hymn oomposed by him.
He probably composed others. (Ι do not
know on what authority Niebuhr says the
Odyssey had greater attractions' for the
Romans than the Iliad. The reason he
assigns is hardly sufficient.)

Texere, mirum quod foret omnibus,
Quicunque celsae nidum Acherontiae

Saltusque Bantinos et arvum

Pingue tenent humilis Forenti,
Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis
Dormirem et ursis, ut premerer sacra
Lauroque collataque myrto,

Non sine dis animosus infans.

Tollor Sabinos, seu mihi frigidum
Praeneste seu Tibur supinum

Seu liquidae placuere Baiae.

Devota non exstinxit arbos,

the pasmge is undoubtedly corrupt (V. L.).
Ifso, all attempts to mend it have only made
it worse. Dovoe have their part in sundry
tales. Heyne’s and Servins’ notes on Aen.

9. Apulo—Apuliae] The differenoe in
the quantity of the first syllable is not sin-
gular. The word Sicanus is used as three
different feet. Italus has the first syllable
long or short, and so with other names.

11. Ludo satiqatumque somno] It is
cleu that some other word like ‘opproe-
aum ’ must be understood for ‘ somno! It
is a translation of καμάτῳ ἀδδηκότες ἠδὲ
καὶ ὕπνῳ (Il. x. 98). Acherontis, Ban-
tia, and Forentum were neighbouring
towns, and still retain their names under the
firma Acerenm, Vanzi. Forenza. Orelli,
with the authority of only one of his Berne
MSS. and that the latest, reads Forenti in-
md of Ferenti, which Bentley has adopted.
‘l'he modern name is in favour of Forenti.
Orelli says the mistake arose from confound-
ing this place with Ferentinum, a Hemi-
can town. Storioe such as Horace has here
invented for himself are told of Stesichorus,
Pindar, Aeschylus, Plato. That which
thur-linui„ (ix. 23) tells of Plato is very like

epithet ‘liquidae‚’ applied to Baiae, is ex-
plained by Cruquius’ Scholiast of the clear-
ness and purity of the atmosphere.

28. Nec Sicula Palinurus unda] Horaoe' s
escape from shipwreck off Cape Palinurus
is no where else related ; and his biographers
have been much perplexed as to the period
of his life to which it ought to be referred.
I have no conjecture to offer. A s 'on
which has been pretty confidently put forth
(Class. Mus. ii. 205), that Horace was
with the expedition against Sex. Pompeius,
A.u.c. 718, in which many vessels were lost
off Cape Palinurus, is inconsistent with the
silence Horace maintains on the subject,
which is no where alluded to in any part of
his writings. It appears most improbable.
Francis, in his note on the first Epode,
makes the same statement z where he got it
Ι do not know. Acron's comment is of no
value: “ Redeuntem se Horatius de Mace-
donia periclitatum dieit.” ‘ Sicula unda '

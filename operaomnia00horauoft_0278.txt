The commentators are much divided in their opinions as to the person to whom this
ode is addressed. The old insoeiptions vary, but in such a manner as to show that they
have none of them any weight or authority. Torrentius mentions three MSS. which are
headed “AdVirgilium Unguentarium urbis discriptio (the common blun'der for ‘descriptio')
Paraenetice,’' and he himself adopts this absurdity, derived from v. 17. The Scholiasta
Acron says, ‘¹ Ad Virgilium negociatorem scribit,’' which is a mere assumption from the
opening lines and v. 25, and when he interprets “juvenum nobilium ’' (v. 15) as Augustus,
or Maecenas,or the step-sons of Augustus, he shows he knew nothing of what he was writing
about. If the question were ω be decided by numbers, it would on the whole be given in
favour of Virgil the poet, and the presumption is so much in favour of that notion that
the onus probandi lieo Ι think with those who deny it. Gesner says there is nothing in
the ode to indioeoe so warm a friendship as subsisted between Horace and the poet V‘u-gil.
But the ode is at best a trifle, and an invitation to dinner is not the most inspiring subject.
When Virgil was going to sea, perhaps for his health, Horace's feeling for him wasshown
strongly enough, which would be natural. Orelli and others object to the expression
‘⁴ juvenum nobilium cliens‚” as applied to Virgilius Maro. But, if the Scholiasta are agreed
that ⁶ juvenum ' may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they at least concede the point that
¹ cliens’ may mean Virgil the poet. Augustus is represented as a ‘ juvenis' in the second
ode of the first book, v. 41 (where see note). The difficulty that arises out of v. 25, ⁴ pono
—studium lucri‚' Orelli himself disposes of when he says that it is evidently a joke3 for,
though he also says that such a joke levelled at such a man would be very flat, this mn
hardly be determined till we know the point of it. We need not assume with Stephana Ι
(Diatr. iv. p. 76) that Horace means by ‘ studium lucri,' ⁴ mercaturam bonarum artium’
(Cic. de Off. iii. 2), or the expectation of payment for his verses. If there be a joke, Virgil
understood it, whoever Virgil was; but be he who he may we do not understand it, so
that nothing is gained by this argument. I have not seen all that has been said upon the
subject, which has been discussed in separate neatises and in all commentat-ies, and which
must always remain matter of opinion founded upon very slender data: but my own
judgment is in favour of supposing the ode to be an early one addressed to P. Virgilius
Maro, the poet, not to ‘⁴ some relation or client of his,” nor to ‘⁴ the grandson of C. Ver-
gilius, the praetor and friend of Cicero,” nor to ‘⁶ a physician of the Nerones,” nor to a
trader, nor to a perfumer. ΤῙιε pastoral images and description in the three first smum
have always appeared to me particularly suited to an ode addressed to Virgil the author of

tint he did nothing worse than yourself. Opimius the miser was εἰσὶ, and nigh unto
death. His heir was exulting in tho prospect of suoeoesion. His physician how-
ever had his money-begs brought out sud emptied before him, and set people to count
the mutonis. This ronsed his patient. 'rhen says the doctor, ‘ If you don't bke eure,
your heirwill oerryoff all your money! ‘Whag before 1 am dead? ⁴We11, theu,
get up: take nome nourishment‚ or you'll die. Come, take some brot-hl ‘ How

(v. 166.) ⁴⁸ It makes no differenoe whether you throw away your money or forben· to use
it. One Servius Oppidius had two farma, which he gave oue to each of his two sons,
und on his death-bed he called them to him md said: ‘ 1 have watched you, my sons,
one thmwing or giving uwuy his toys, the other hiding them in holoe. Take heed lest
you fan under opposite mnnias ε do you beware of diminishing‚ and you of inm-msing,
thefortune 1 leave you. 1 cantion you both against the temptations of ambifion. My
eunte be upon you if you ever aim at public offiooe. You may be tempted to ruia
yourselves for popularity, aping the munifioenoe of Agrippa as the fox might ape the
lion.’

(v. 187.) ‘Whyrefuse bur-inl to the greatAjax, Oking?' ‘Beoeuse hewas so madae
to kill ο flock of sheep and thought he was killing Ulyssee, Menelaus, and me.' ‘ But
were you sane when you offered your child at Aulis ? Ajax spnred his own flaeh and
blood3 and, though he cursed the Atridae, he did not kill either Teucer or even
myssa! ⁸ But to loose the fleet Ι propitiated the gods with blood! ‘ Yes, madman,
with your own.'-Any man who takoe up false fancioe is out of his mind, whether it be
stom solly or passion. Ajax was mad; but when you commit aime· for the sake of
emptyinsoeipfions,nreyounot as madashe? If :manu-aneto enrrynboutnlnmb

were to take his daughter for a lamb and sacrifice her, he would be eulled mad too.
The fool then is mnd, the depraved is more mad, but the ambitium is maddest of au.

(v. 224.) “ 'l'hen for the spendthriflz, he is certainly mad. A young man oomoe into his
fathers property ε he sends for all the tradaemen and flings his money at random
among them. Another takes n jewel from his mistrem’ ear, melts it down und swauows
it: another dinoe hnbitually on nighfingaloe. Are these mad or not mad?

HORATII FLAGOI

Traverso calamo signum, ambitiosa recidet
Ornamenta, parum claris lucem dare coget,
Arguet ambigue dictum, mutanda notabit,

In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.
Ut mala quem scabies aut morbus regius urget

Clamet, “ Io cives 1⁵³ non sit qui tollere curet.

Si curet quis opem ferre et demittere funem,
“ Qui scis an prudens huc se projecerit atque
Servari nolit?” dicam, Siculique poetae

Dum cupit Empedocles, ardentem frigidus Aetnam
Sit jus liceatque perire poetis:

450. Fiet Aristarchum] Aristarchus,
whose name was proverbial among the an-
cients as a critic, was born in Samothracia
about ac. 730. He passed the greater
part of his life at Alexandria under the
patronage of Ptolemaeus Philopator, Epi-
phanes, and Philometor, the second of whom
he educated.

453. morbus reyius] This, which is
otherwise called ‘arquatus morbus,' ‘ au-
rugo,' and by the Greeks ἷκτερος, is the
jaundice. Celsus says it is so called because
the remedies resorted to were chiefly amuse-
ments and indulgences to keep up the spirits,
such as none but the ric-h could afford.
(See Pliny xxii. 24, ξ 53.) No disorder
depresses the spirits more than jaundice.
Here it is supposed to be infectious, which
it is not.

454. Aut fanaticus error] ⁴ Fanaticus ’
(from ‘ fanum ') was properly applied to the
priests of Bellona. See S. ii. 3. 223, n.‚
and Juvenal iv. 123, “ fanaticus oestro Per-
cussus, Bellona, tuo.'’ Juvenal also applies
it to the priests of Cybele (ii. 112), “crine
senex fanaticus albo, Sacrorum antistes.’'
The infiuence of the moon (⁴ iracunda

Diana ¹) in producing mental dmngement
is one of the earliest fallades in medicine.
The Greeks oelled persons supposed to be
so affected σεληνιακοί.

455. tetiqisse timenq ‘The wiseavoid

himlikechildren after a aazymanin the

459. lonqum clamem This is like
Homer’s μακρὸν ἄϋσε (IL iii. 81).

464. Deus immortalis haberi] See Epp-
i. 12. 20. There are various mai-vallone
stoi-ies told of the death of Empedocles,
suited to the character he bore in his life‚of
a magician, a oontroller of the elementa,
&c. “ According to the most probable of
these discrepant statements, being at lut
expelled his native city (Agrigentum), he
retired to the Peloponnesus, and thu·
brought his marvellous existence to a close.
This story is from Timaeus, in whose hie-
tory Empedocles is frequently mentioned.
The statement of his death in Aetna can be
traced back to Heraclides Ponticus, a very
insufficient authority, and who believed in
it '’ (Ritter, Hist. Ano. Phil. i. 492).

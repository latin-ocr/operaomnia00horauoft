HORATII FLAGGI

Quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus;

Qui te pascit ager tuus est, et villicus Orbi,

Cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,

Te dominum sentit.

Das nummos, accipis uvam,

Pullos, ova, cadum temeti: nempe modo isto
Paulatim mercaris agrum fortasse trecentis

Aut etiam supra nummorum millibus emptum.

Dict. of Antiquities, art. ‘Mancipium’).
A third person held a pair of scales (4 libra ¹¹)
which the purchaser touched with a piece of
money, at the same time laying his hand on
the thing purchased. According to a set
form of words he claimed the thing as his
own, and handed the money to the seller as
a token of the sum agreed upon. This
form of purchase was called ‘mancipatio.'
The seller was said ‘mancipio dare' (to
which ⁴ mancipare ' in this place is equiva-
lent), and the purchaser was said 4 mancipio
accipere! When property of the nature of
4 res mancipii ' came into a man's possession
without the regular forms of ‘ mancipatio ’
or 4 injure cessio ¹ (both of which are ex-
plained in the Dict. of Antiquities), he was
not owner ‘ ex jure Quiritium ’ until he be-
came so by ‘usucapio,’ that is, by having
been in possession for a certain time, vary-
ing according as the things were 4 res man-
cipi’ or not. If no one claimed owner-
ship in it before the expiration of that
time, he who had it became owner, as
much as if he had received it by ‘manci-
patio.’ Hence ‘ usus ’ is said ‘ mancipare‚'
because the effect is the same whether a
man ‘ possidendo usucapiat ’ or ‘ mancipio
accipiat.' (See Dict. Ant„ arts. 4 Domi-
nium,’ 4 Mancipium,' ‘in Jure Cessi0,'
⁴ Usucapio.') But 4 usus ’ here means that
sort of possession which consists in the
enjoyment of the fruits by paying for them.

ἕξ160. villicue orbi,] Who is meant by
Orbius, if any body, it is impossible to say.
He had landed property and sold the pro-
duce. As to ‘ villicus ’ see Epp. i. 14. 1, n.
161. Cum seqetes occat] Cicero says
(Cat. Maj. c. 15): 44 quae (terra) cum
gremio mollito ac subacto sparsum semen
excepit, primum id occoecatum cohibet, ex
quo occatio quae hoc efficit nominata est.¹’
This is a bad attempt at etymology. The
place which this process of harrowing had
in the year’s work is marked in a passage of

Plautus (capt. iii. 5. 3, sqq.), where Hegio
calls Tyndarus—

“ Sator sartorque scelerum et messor
maxume ;”

and he answers:

44 Non occatorem dicere audebas prius?
Nam semper occant prius quam sarriunt
rustici.

‘ San-ire ⁹ is ‘to weed.'

163. cadum temeti .·] 4 Temetnm ' is an
old word, signifying ‘wine.y 44 Qui de
victu atque cultu populi Romani scripse-
runt mulieres Romae atque in Latio aetatem
abstemias egisse, hoc est vino semper, quod
temetum prisca lingua appellant, abstinuisse
dicunt'¹ (Gell. x. 23). Hence Cicero says:
“carent temeto omnes mulieres,’' though
the word was probably not common in his
day. Plautus uses it, and Juvenal. (See
Forcell.)

164. trecentis—nummorum millibus]
⁴ Three hundred sestertia' 'taking the
value of the ‘sestertium' at 81. 17⁸. ld„
this sum would be 26561. 5⁸. of our money.

167. Emptor Aricini quondam] The
MSS. have different readings, ‘quoniaml
‘ quondam,’ 4 quando,’ 4 cum jam,' of which
the first appears to have most authority
from MSS. All those of Cruquius, Torren-
tius, and Orelli, have 4 quoniam,’ and some
of Fea’s. The old editions, as far as I have
seen, all have 4 quondam' (Ven. 1483,
⁴ condam ¹), and that is the readmg generally
received. 4 Emptor quondam,' as Orelli
sayS, is equivalent to ‘is qui quondam
emit! As to Aricia see S. i. 5. 1, n. As
to Veii, the town which was taken by
Camillus had long ceased to exist. (See

Lucan. vii. 392, quoted on Epp. 1. 11. 6, ’

and Propert. iv. 10. 27, sqq.) It had been
replaced (whether on the same site or not
is uncertain) by a new city, which when
Horace wrote was almost iu ruins, having
suffered in the late civil ware. Julius Caesar
divided its lands among his soldiers. In

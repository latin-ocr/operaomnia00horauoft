HORATII FLAOOI

An qui Fortunae te responsare superbae
Liberum et erectum praesens hortatur et aptat?

Quodsi me populus Romanus forte roget, cur

Non ut porticibus sic judiciis fruar isdem,

Nee sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit,
Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni

Respondit referam: Quia me vestigia terrent,

Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.

Belua multorum es capitum. Nam quid sequar aut quem?
Pars hominum gestit conducere publica, sunt qui

Crustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras,

Multis occulto crescit res fenore.

for ‘ aptat,’ which is the reading of the
existing MSS. with few exceptione. Cru-

quius first adopted ⁴ aptat‚’ as far as 1 can
discover. ‘Optat' has little if any mean-

ing here. ‘ Aptat ' is explained by ‘⁴ pectus
praeceptis format amicis '' (Epp. ii. 1. 1:28),

which province belongs, Horace says, ιο the

p 71. Non ut porticibus sic judiciis] As
to ⁴ porticus’ see S. i. 4. 134. Ηο has said
that the world are not fit guides, and he
goes on ιο prove this by the inconsistencies
of men, both rich and poor. He says, if
people ask him why he mixes with them in
the ordinary way of society, in the prome·
nades, &c., but does not form his judgment
of things as they do, he answers them as
the fox answered the lion in the fable3 and
the meaning of the answer here is that he
found that of all those who joined the
world and made money their chief pursuit,

none had survived or recovered their right
judgment. Socrates uses this same fable of
Aesop in his conversation with Alcibiades,

to illustrate the wealth of Lacedaemon, into
which gold had flowed from all qnarters for
many generations, and from whence none
had come forth (Alc. Prim. ii. 123, Steph.).
Lucilius (ap. Nonium, verb. Spectare) refers
to this fable. The following lines have been
preserved entire:

“Quid sibi vult quare sit ut introversus et
Speocdtetrit atque ferant vestigia et omnia
prorsus ?”

76. Belua multorum ee capilum] ‘The
avarice of the world is like the hydra with
many heads3 if you check it 111 0110 form it

is oue to take for one’ s guide. ²' Bentley,
without any authority, substitutes‘ est’ for

‘ Occulto fenore ' means interest which was
greater than the law allowed (see S. ἰ. 2. 14,

‘Publica’ may be equivalent ω’

(see Cic. in Vyerr. 11. 3. 71, Long’ s note), or
it may refer to public buildings and works

Perhaps the latter suits the context best.

different men their different tastes, yet even
this is of no use3 for the same men when
they get rich get capricions, 81111 are always
changing their minds. If the rich man has
set his heart upon building a house at Baiae,
he does not brook a moment's delay; the
waters of the Lacus Lucrinus on one side,
and the sea on the other, are disturbed with
the eager preparations with which the rich
man begins to satisfy his desire. 'rho
allusion is the same as in C. ii. 18. 19, sqq„

240 HORATII FLAOGI

Si chartae sileant quod bene feceris
Mercedem tuleris. Quid foret Iliae
Mavortisque puer si taciturnitas
Obstaret meritis invida Romuli?
Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum
Virtus et favor et lingua potentium
Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.
Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori:
Caelo Musa beat. Sic J ovis interest
Optatis epulis impiger Hercules,
Clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis
Quassas eripiunt aequoribus rates,
Ornatus viridi tempora pampino
Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.

facultas poetica! I doubt the accur-acy of
that interpretation. I think it rather means
that, though Aeacus was virtuous (and he was
much celebrated for his justice), his virtue
would not have raised him to the skies but
for the applause won him by the poets3 the
musoe. therefore are his virtue aud the
public esteem (favor), and the poet’s praise
that made his virtue known. The other
heroes mentioned are those instanced in a
former ode (iii. 3). Concerning the ‘ divites
insulae,’ see Epod. xvi. The last line is

CARMEN IX.

It is singular that the ode which of all others dwells most on the moral virtues of the
person addressed should be written to one whose moral character has been so much
blackened as that of M. Lollius. Τ110 integrity which Horace so highly commenda is
that particular virtue in which, according to the testimony of the histor-ian Velleius
(ii. 97. 102), and of Pliny (N. H. ix. 35), and of the emperor Tiberius (Tae. Ann. iii. 48),
he was most wanting. But he was a personui enemy of the emperor, and Velleius was
Tiberius’ worst flatterer. Pliny wrote what he heard, and this would come down through

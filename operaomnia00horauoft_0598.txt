HORATII FLAGGI .

Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma? Non tibi parvum· ⁷
Ingenium, non incultum est et turpiter hirtum. ⁹
Seu linguam causis acuis seu civica jura

Respondere paras seu condis amabile carmen,

Prima feres hederae victricis praemia.

Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posses

Quo te caelestis sapientia duceret ires.

Hoc opus, hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli
Si patriae volumus, si nobis vivere cari.

Debes hoc etiam rescribere, si tibi 0111410

Quantae conveniat Munatius; an male sarta

Gratia nequicquam coit et rescinditur.

Seu calidus sanguis seu rerum inscitia vexat
Indomita cervice feros, ubicunque locorum

Vivitis, indigni fraternum rumpere foedus,

Quodsi 25
3ο
At vos
:35

Pascitur in vestrum reditum votiva juvenca.

21. Quae circumvolitas] This similitude
of a bee gathering honey from thyme Ho-
race applies to himself (C. iv. 2. 27, sqq„
where see note). As to ⁸ orator ' and ‘ re-
spondere,' see S. i. l. 9, n.‚ and on ‘ hederae
proemiass see C. i. 1. 29.

23. seu civica jura Respondere] This is
a singular expression for the usual ⁴ jus
respondere,' or ‘ de jure respondere.' Pliny
has “jus civile respondere '' <Epp. 6. 15).

26. Friyida curarum fomenta] It is
not easy to decide upon the meaning of
‘ fomenta' here. Some suppose it signifies
those selfish objects, such as honour, riches,
&c., which seem to foster (‘ fovere ') care,
and which make the heart cold and the
feelings dull. Others apply it to similar
objects 3 but as the remedies by which care
is sought to be aueviated are “ fomenta
vulnus nil malum levantia '’ (Epod. xi. 17),
1 incline to the latter myself. (See note on
the above Epode). They are still ‘ frigidass
in the sense above given.

28. parvi properemus et ampli] As to
‘properemus,' see Epp. 2. 61, 11., and with
the sentiment compare Epp. 1. 25, “Aeque
pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque.''

30. εἰ tibi curae] Most of the MSS.
have ‘ sit,’ but ‘ si ’ is better, and has suffi-
cient authority. ¹ Si ' and ‘ sit' are con-
fused in the MSS. See Epod. i. 5, 11.
Horace says, ‘ You must write me back
word whether you make as much of Muna-
tius as he desei-ves, or whether your mutual

regard (which had been interrupted), like a
wound ill sewu, refuses to unite and is tom

⁵ open again.” Munatius has been mentioned

before (C. i. 7, Introduction) as the son of
Munatius Plancus, the consul of mmo. 712.
We know nothing more about him except
that he was consul 111 Λ.0.0. 766, and that
he was afterwards sent as one of the com-
missioners from the senate to the mntinous
German legions (Tac. Anu. i. 39). It ap-
pears he and Florus had quarrelled3 we are
not told what it was about3 bnt Horace
attributes it to youthful heat and ignormoe
of the world. He likens them to unbroke
horses, and in terms more affectionate than
grammatical tells them that they ought to
make it up, and that when they come home
they will find the fatted calf ready for sna-i-
fice. Compare C. i. 36, written 011 the re-
turn of Numida. It is impossible to put
the different parts of the sentence together
so as to make the construction regular and
natural, but the sense is clear enough. Ho-
race frequently uses ‘dignus' with the in-
finitive. See C. iii. 21. 6, 11. ‘Indignus’ he
uses in the same way here and· 111 A. P. 231,
but 111 1110 usual prose construction with ‘ qui’
and the subjunctive in S. ii. 3. 236. From
⁸ fraternum foedus ⁹ Comm. Cruq. makes
them brothers. Horace only means that
they were or had been and ought to be
“ paene gemelli Fraternis animis,” as he
says belovv, Epp. lo. 3.

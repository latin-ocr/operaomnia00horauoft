HORATII FLAOGI

Quid Marte posses. Milite nam tuo

Drusus Genaunes, implacidum genus,

Breunosque veloces, et arces
Alpibus impositas tremendis
Dejecit acer plus vice simplici ;
Major Neronum mox grave proelium ’

Commisit immanesque Raetos

Auspiciis pepulit secundis,
Spectandus in certamine Martio,
Devota morti pectora liberae

Quantis fatigaret ruinis ;

Indomitas prope qualis undas

πρὸς θεῶν φράσον, φίλη

δέσποινα, τόνδε τίς ποτ’ ἐστὶν ὁ ξένος ;

10. The Genauni were one of the southern
tribes of Raetia lying between the lakes
Verbanus (Maggiore) and Larius (Como)
in the modern Val d’Agno. The Breuni
Cramer also places south of the Alps in the
Val Braunia3 others place them higher up
among the modern Grisons, between the
sources of the Rhine and the Oenus (Inn).
But at any rate the Grisons occupy a lar-ger
portion of the ancient Raetia than that
which belonged to the Breuni, a small
though a warlike tribe. Pliny has preserved
an inscription from a trophy set up in one of
the Alpine towns on this occasion: “IMP.

character Horace gives of these tribes is
that which is given by all writers of the
time. ‘ Implacidum' is a word not found
in any writer earlier than Horace. It is as
likely that he made as that he found it:
either may be true. Velleius, in his account
of this war, speaks of ‘⁴ multas urbium et
castellorum oppugnationes '' in the course
of it, and says it was carried on ‘¹ majore
curn periculo quam damno Romani exerei-
tus,’' which description cor-responde to that
of Horace. ⁴ Plus vice simplici’ the Scho-
liasts Porph. and Comm. Cruq. explain to
mean ‘with greater advantage on his side
than the enemy’s,' he being ‘sine clade
victor’ (v. 32). The literal version would
thus be, ⁴ with more than an even exchange,’
i. e. of blood. Some persons, after Lam·-
binus, understand it to mean more than
once. Gesner suggests that ⁴ vice ' may be
equivalent to ‘periculo,' but 1 believe the

20

Scholiasta to be right, though the words
are not free from difficulty. As to the
construction ‘ plus vice,’ see C. i. 13. 20.

17. Spectandmr— Quantis] This meme
imitated from the Greek idiom θαυμαστὸς
οσυις.

20. Indomitas prope qualis] Bentley
proposed ⁸ indomitus ' because the hamsed
Raetians could not properly be compared t'o
the untamed waters. One ΜΒ. has been
found to support him. The wonder is iu
such a case that there are not more. Resides
the support given to ‘indomitas ' bytheuss„
it may be observed, that the fourth verse of
the Alcaic stanza is frequently consti-noted
with a noun and its adJeetive in the first
and last place, and co nding in their
last syllables. In this ode we have vv. 12,
16, 20, 36, 52, answering to this rule or
habit. ⁴ Prope’ has no particular force.
Peerlkamp says it weakens the sentence,
and Orelli says there is some truth in that
censure. Horace, whose ear was familiar
with the language of the Greek tragediam,
copied their σχεδόν τι (a common phrase in
compar-1338) withonii? ξεὲιιε comi-‘ius that ἐξ
wea en verse, 1 oes so. erepee
the phrase S. ii. 3. 268. The setting of the
Pleiades, at the beginning of November,
was reckoned as the commencement of -
winter; they therefore are said to bui-st the
clouds (scindere nubes), which poured down
rain upon the earth. Jani and others in-
terpret the passage as referring to the rising
of the Pleiades in May, when their approach
dispels the last clouds-of winter, and the
south wind blows its last storm. Gesner
(with whom Doering agrees) supposes
Horace to mean that Tiberius was like the
winds, “veris comites quae mare tempe-
rant ¹⁹ (C. iv. 12. l), the waves being the
enemies of Rome. But this destroye the
eomparison obviously contained in the

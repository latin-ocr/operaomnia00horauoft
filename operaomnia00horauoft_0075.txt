ss· Nec Martiales Haediliae lupos,]⁴ Hae-
diliae' is the reading of nearly every MS„
andinthemarginofB, Orellisay s, iswrit-
teu‘ mons, ’and so he and Dillenbr. un-
derstand it-one of the Sabine hills. ‘ Hae-
dilia: the reading of some MSS„ aud
most of the old editions, is only a cor-
ruption of the other. Bentley takes to
himself the credit of suggesting ‘ haeduleae ¹
formed from ⁴ haedus,' as ‘ equuleae,’ ⁴ hin-
nuleae,’ from ‘ equus’ and ⁴ hinnus.' But
Aratus and Torrentius had anticipated his
conjecture, though they thought only of the
masculine ‘ haedulei.' ‘ Haeduleae' has been
very generally adopted since Bentley.
Gesner says this reading ‘ haeduleae ' occurs
‘in bonis libris :' but he does not men-
tion vwhich they are, and Bentley had never
seen them, or he would have mentioned

,. .‘ that he had done so. ⁴ Haediliae ' Lambinus

and some others prefer, as signifying ¹ the
folds,' but no such word is found elsewhere,
and there is no analogy to support it. If
there were such a word, its antepenultimam
syllable would be long, as ¹ ovile!

14. Hic tibi copia] The order of the
words is ⁸ hic copia opulenta ruris honorum
manabit ad plenum tibi benigno cornu!
⁶ Here plenty, rich in the glories of the

country, shall pour herself out for thee

abundantly from her genereus horn.’ ‘ Ad
plenum' occurs in the same sense Georg.

“Huc aigei· ille malus dulcesque a fontibus
un ae

Ad plenum calcentur-.''

The ⁸ cornu copia,' so common in ancient
works of art, was a symbol belonging to the
goddess Fortuna, ω whom it is said to
have been presented by Hercules More
may be learnt by referring to the Articles
Amalthea (whose horn it is supposed origi-
nally to have been) and Achelous, from
whom Hercules won it, in Smith’s Dict.
Myth.

18. ufide Te'ia]⁴ ‘Perhaps, '' says Torren-
tius, “Anacreon had a song upon the sub-
ject, for to talk of adapting the Odyssey of
Homer to the lyre of Anacreon is absurdss'
That Horace had some reason for choosing
this subject is certain, but who shall say
what it was? Why Circe is called‘ vitrea.y
has been much disputed. Smart and Fran-
cistranslate the word⁴ frail! Dacier refers it

to her complexionst ‘qui etoit uni comme ’

une glacefl It probably means, as Turne-
bus says, no more than‘ caerula' in Epod.
xiii. 16: ‘nec mater domum caerula te
revehet;'’ and‘ virides’ in Ov. Tr. i. 2. 59:

“Pro superi viridesque Dei quibus aequora
curae)

19. laborantes in uno] See Argument.

22. Semeleius—Thyoneus] Bacchus is
here called by both the names of his
mother Semele, who was also named
Thyone ἀπὸ τοῦ θύειν.

25. male dispari] ‘ Male’ is here used as
in S. i. 3. 31, ‘⁶ Male laxus calceus.'' Cyrus

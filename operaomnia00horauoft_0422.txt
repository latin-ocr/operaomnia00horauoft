12. Laevinum, Valeri yenus] ΤῙιε
Valeria ⁴ gens ’ was one of the most ancient
in Rome, and embraced some of the most
distinguished families, among others that of
Publicola, the earliest member of which
mentioned in history is Valerius Publicola,
the colleague of Brutus after the expulsion
of the kings. The family of Laevinus was
another branch of the same gens, the most
conspicuous of whom were P. Valerius
Laevinus, who conducted the war against
Pyrrhus, and M. Valerius, who in the second
Punic war was governor of Sicily. Of the
Laevinus in the text we know nothing but
from the text and the Scholiasta Porphyrion
and Comm. Cruq., who say that he was a
man of most abandoned character, so bad
that even the populace, who were not easily
deterred from conferring their honours upon
the vicious, could not be prevailed on by
admiration of his high ancestry to advance
him beyond the quaestorship; that is to
say, he never held a curule office. Pliny
(N. H. l. xxxv. c. 2, ξ 2) mentions the
indignation of one of the Messallae (another
branch of the same gens) at a bust of one
of the Laevini being placed with those of
his own family. It is not improbable
that the man Horace mentions had
brought such discredit upon the name, that
it mortified the proudv Messalla that their
family connexion should be so paraded.
‘ Valeri genus ’ is like ‘ audax Iapeti genus,’
C. i. 3. 27 (see note). On ‘unde‚’ which
is equivalent to ‘ a quo,' see C. i. 12. 17, n.;
ii. 12. 7. ‘Fugit' is the reading of the
best MSS„ including all the Blandinian and
others of high authority quoted by Lambi-
nus, Orelli, Fea, Bentley, the three last of
whom have adopted it, I think rightly.
Most of the older editions have ‘ fuit ;' but
there is no objection to the use of the
present tense ι it is the historic. ‘ Licere ’
is ‘ to be put up for sale,' and its correlative
term is ‘liceri,’ ‘to bid for an article at a
sale by auction! ⁴ Notare ¹ is to set a bad
mark upon, to brand, and was technically
applied to the censors (see note on v. 20).
‘ J udice quo nosti ' is an instance of attrac-
tion, which figure the Romans borrowed
from the Greeks, but did not use so com—

monly. See Examples in Key's L. G. 1061,
and add Terence, Heaut. i. l. 35: “Scire
hoc vis? Hac quidem de causa qua dixi
tibi ;” and Cicero (ad Fam. v. 14)= ‘⁴ cum
scribas et aliquid agas eorum quorum con-
suesti gaudeo.” The editions of the fifteenth
century all have ⁶ qu0,’ and that is the
reading of Ascensius (1519). The edition
of Aldus of the same year, and nearly all
subsequent editions till Bentley, have
‘quem‚’ for which there is no authority
whatever among the MSS. now existing or
known to have been collated. ‘Titulis et
imaginibus' were inscriptions and waxen
bu sts recording the distinctions of any mem-
ber of a family who had borne a curule
office. See Polyb. vi. 53.

17. Quid oportet Nos faeere] Bentley
says he certainly never saw any thing
“ pravius tetriusque ’' (epitheta it is hard to
understand, especially the latter) than this
reading ⁴ nos.' “ Apage sodes inanem
jactantiam. Non cognosco Nostrum tam
superbum et gloriosum.” He therefore
proposes ‘ vos :’ “Vos dico Augustos,
Maecenates, Polliones, Messallas, &c.” It
is the fashion with some critica to exclaim
against all manifestations of sels-satisfac-
tion, however legitimate the occasion, and
to explain away and alter passages in which
Horace says a word for himself. But there
is neither pride nor humility here. He
means to say that those who by educafion
and profession and experience were very
far removed from the common people
ought to judge differently from them, and
better. In this number he was quite jusfi-
fied in placing himself. The MSS„ theoeo- -
fore, which are unanimous in favour of
‘ nos‚' are not to be deserted. ‘Vos ’ is a
mere conjecture. The MSS. nearly all read
‘longe longeque ς’ a few have ‘longe la-
teque,' which is the reading of all the old
editions. Cruquius first edited ‘longe
longeque,' quoting Cicero (de Finn. ii. 21):
‘⁴ plurimum se, et longe longeque plurimum,
tribuere honestati.” Ovid uses the same
expression (Met. iv. 325) ε “ Sed longe cunctis
longeque potentior illis.’' It occurs also in
Dig. iv. 4. 39: “Tendentibus curatoribus »
minoris fundum emptor exstitit Lucius

The first of these verbs refers to the pas-
sions re presented in tragedy, the other to
the pompous words employed by inferior
writers to express them. ‘Amp ulls’ sig

and corresponds to the Greek λήκυθος,

novanus, to whom Ovid wrote one of his
Epistlae from Pontus (iv. 10), but it was
not the same man. Τὶιε advice Horace
here sends him is to write something origi-
nal, and not confine himself to the ide-s of
oth’er authors, either in the way of trans-
lation or imitation. It has been mentioned
before (C. i. 31, Introduction) that Augus-
tus attached s library to the temple he built
for Apollo on the Mons Palatinus. Aesop's
suble of the jackdav, who dressed himself
in the peacock’s oest-offsmthers, is told by
Phaedrus (i. 3). Δίσώπιος κολοιός was a
proverb.

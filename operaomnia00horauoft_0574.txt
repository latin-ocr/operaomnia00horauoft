HORATII FLACGI.

Nasidiene, redis mutatae frontis, ut arte

Emendaturus fortunam ;> deinde secuti · 85
Mazonomo pueri magno discerpta ferentes

Membra gruis sparsi sale multo, non sine farre3

Pinguibus et ficis pastum jecur anseris albae

Et leporum avolsos, ut multo suavius, armos,

Quam si cum lumbis quis edit ;

tum pectore adusto 90

Vidimus et merulas poni et sine clune palumbes,

Suaves res, si non causas narraret earum et

Naturas dominus; quem nos sic fugimus ulti,

Ut nihil omnino gustaremus, velut illis

Canidia afflasset pejor serpentibus Afris.'' 95

tend to be laughing at something else when
Nasidienus comes in. As to ‘ fictis rerum‚’
see C. iv. 12. 19, n. ‘ Balatrone secundo‚'
Orelli says, is a metaphor from a favoni-able
wind, as if it meant that Balatro helped
the joke. This is not very satisfactory.
Acron interprets it ‘⁴ ex tristi hilari facto,”
which belongs more to ‘mutatae frontis!
Comm. Cruq. Ι think is nearer the mean-
ing when he renders it ‘¹ hypocritam agente,
subsequente, subserviente3 pocula etiam
poscens secundabat omnia jocis suis.’' He
played δευτεραγωνὶστης who supported
the principal actor, but was not so
prominent. (See Epp. i. 18. 14.) Ba-
latro was a wit and sarcastic. He sup-
plied jokes aud the others laughed. ‘ Mazo-
nomus' was a large round dish, properly
one from which grain (μάζα) was dis-
tributed. Cranes became a fashionable
dish with the Romans, but not till after
this time, when storks were preferred (see

S. 2. 50, n.). The liver of a white goose
fattened on figs, the legs of a hare sex-ved up
sepau-atel„ as being (according to the host),
better flavoured when dressed without the
loins, blackbirds bnrnt in wastin& and
wood-pigeons with the hinder parts, which
were most sought after, removed (perhaps
from the ignoranee of the host, who

thought novelty was the best recommen-

dation of his dishes),—these composed the γ ³

last ‘ ferculum ’ brought in as special deli-

cacies to make up for the late catastrophe. .

But the officiousness of the host destroyed
the relish of his dishes, such as they were,
and the gumts took their revenge by tasting
nothing he put before them, and presently
taking their leave.

her. See Ep. iii. 8, n.; v. and xvii„ In-

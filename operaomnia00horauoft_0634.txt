HORATII FLAGOI

Qun) tibi visa Chios, Bullati, notaque Lesbos,
Quid concinna Samos, quid Croesi regia Sardes,

Smyrna quid et Colophon?

l. Quid tibi visa C'Izios,] The island of
Chios was rugged and mountainous (⁴⁴ Chio’s
rocky isle ''); but had, as it still has, an
excellent climate and choice wines : its wo-
men also were very handsome3 in all of
which ancient and modern accounts agree.
Its principal town, Chios, was a noble city,
richly adorned with buildings and works of
art. Verres plundered it of some of its
best statues (Cic. in Verr. ii. 1. 19). Not
a trace of any thing remains. Horace
calls Lesbos celebrated, and its fame need
not be supposed to depend on its wines, or
on Alcaeus and Sappho, as the commen-
tators say. From the Trojan War to the
times of the Roman Empire, when Tacitus
calls it “insula nobilis et amoena ” (Ann.
vi. 3), the fortunes of Lesbos, its revolu-
tions and conquests, its connexion with
Athens, its tradition of OrpheuS, its poets
and musicians and statesmen, its cities and
works of art, its fields and vineyards and
climate, all contributed to make it the most
⁶⁰{lffssufftiibis‘issdssh32A353⁸g¹1¹22 but the
town is meant, and it is called ‘concinna’
from its buildings, of which a temple of
Juuo was one of the most conspicuous.
Cicero calls it “fanum antiquissimum et
nobilissimum ” (Verr. ii. l. 19). Outside
and inside this temple was adorned with
the finest works of art. There was also a
celebrated mole at Samos, made to protect
the harbour, which would be an object of
interest to a traveller.

The town of Sardes (αἱ Σάρδεις), or the
greater part of it, from the readiness with
which it was burnt to the ground in the
revolt of the Ionians, n.c. 499, must ori-
ginally have been built of slight materials,
though it was the seat of enormous wealth
during the reigns of the Lydian kings, and
especially that of Croesus, whose palace be-
came the residence of the Persian San-aps
and was beautified. by them, especially by
Cyrus the younger, whose gardens are
celebrated (Cic. de Senect. c. 17). The
strength of its natural position was extra-
ordinary. The river Pactolus flowed through
the city. There are ruins still in existence,
one of which (of brick) is said to have been
the palace of Croesus. There are traces
of a theatre and marble piei-s supporting
masses of brick, but all these and the other
no doubt are Roman. Sardes surrendered

to Alexander, and aster his death passed
through the hands of Antigonus, Seleucus,
and his descendants, and the kings of Per-
gamum, till Lydia became part of the
Roman province of Asia. Some of the im-
perial coins of Sardes bear the inscription,
ΣΑΡΔΕΙΣ. ΑΣΙΑΣ. ΛΥΔΙΑΣ. ΜΗΤΡΟ-

3. Smyrna quid et Colophon ?] Alex-
ander the Great found Sm inruins,
and conceived the design of re-building it,
being prompted by Nemesis in a dream.
He did not live to do so, but Antigonus
began and Lysimachus finished 8 new town
on a magnificent scale. Strabo (1.‚xiv. p.
646) gives a description of it, and of
it as one of the most beautiful dties of
Ionia. There are coins of the empire
bearing the inscription ΣΜΥΡΝΔΙΩΝ
ΠΡΩΤΩΝ ΑΣΙΑΣ ΚΑΔΔΕῘ KAI ME-
ΓΕΘΕΙ. Among other objecta of interest
was a temple erected to Homer, and called
Homerium. Τὴθ inhabitants claimed him
as their countryman, and showed a cave in
which it was said he wrote his poems. The
ruins that now stand are not many, the
Turks having used the materiale for their
buildings; but excavations have brought to
light many statues, inscriptions, and medals.

Colophon, also in Ionia on the Hales, was
destroyed by Lysimachus with Lebedus
(v. 6). Its chief attraction was its neigh-
bourhood to the shrine of the clm-ian
Apollo. At present only a few huts stand
on the site of this town.

— Majora minorave sama,] ‘Be they
greater or less than report makes them out to
be (I care not which), are they not all nme
compared with the Campus Martius and the
Tiber?' ‘Ve' is probably formed from
‘ vel,’ and had much the same meaning,
being chiefly used in poetry
is used an indifference in the speafler's
mind is implied as to which of the two
cases or objects be taken. ‘Ne' being at-
tached to ‘ cuncta’ shows that the emphasis
lies on that word (see Key’s L. G. 1444,n.,
and 1417). Ven. 1483, Asoens. 1529, and

Bentley, have followed the Aldine editions,
which have ‘minorane.' But ‘ne’ has
little MS. authority. It would be unusual
here. “ ‘Ne,’ in the second part of a

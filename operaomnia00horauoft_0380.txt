Cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis,

HORATII FLAGGI

Cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum

Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius? At tibi contra
Evenit, inquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.

Iracundior est paulo, minus aptus acutis

Naribus horum hominum3 rideri possit eo quod

Rusticius tonso toga defluit et male laxus
In pede calceus haeret : at est bonus ut melior vir
Non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus, at ingenium ingens

Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.

Concute num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim

on the authority of one MS.‚ to ⁴ praevideas,’
which Rutgersius had conjectured without
knowing there was this authority. He
quotes a MS. of Acron as having ‘provi-
deas‚’ which Fea found in two Vatican MSS.
sse received text of the Scholiasts give
⁴pervideas.' The sense in which ‘praevi-
deas’ is understood is that of ⁴ praetervidere,'
παραβλέπειν, ⁴ to overlook‚’ in support of
which the following verses of Menander are
quoted from Plutarch:

τί τάλλότριον, ὤνθρωπε βασκανώτατε,
κακὸν ὀξυδερκεῖς, τὸ δ’ἶδιον παραβλέπεις;

But there is no authority for that use of the
word ⁴ praevidere! The reading of nearly
all the MSS. and editions, ⁴ pervideas ’ gives
the best sense, ⁴ while you see through your
own faults as well as a blear-eyed man might
do.’ Bentley would like to read ⁴ cum tua
tu videas‚'-a very unfortunate suggestion.
He also changes ⁴ mala' into ⁴ male‚' upon
little authority, and that construction occurs
often enough iu this Satire: we do not need
to add another example. The MSS. and
editions are nearly unanimous in reading
⁴ mala.' Fea mentions ‘pervideas mala' as
the reading of Hildebert at the end of the
cleventh century. (Mor. Phil. Oper. 996.)

27. serpens Epidauriusf] Τὴε serpents
of Epidaurus (on the Sinus Saronicus) were
proverbial, in consequence of Aesculapius
having been conveyed from that place,
where above others he was worshipped, to
Rome, in the form of a serpent, to avert a
pestilence. (See Liv. Epit. lib. xi.)

29. Iracundior eat μανίᾳ] Horace is
illustrating here the tendeucy of those
quick-sighted critica of their neighbours'
characters to maguify the faults they find.
The first instance is of a man who is sensi-
tive under (not suited for) the sharp judg-
ment of the men of that day (⁴ horum

Denique te ipsum
35

hominum ⁹), meu who had the keenness of
a bloodhound' s scent in finding out defecta,
and no delicacy in proclaiming them. So
I understand ⁴ minus aptus‚' διο. with tho
Scholiasts. Orelli interprem it differently:
that the man, by being some-what hasty,
gave a handle to these Pharisees. In respect
to the next instance of a person of slovenly
habits, Acron says ‘⁴ hic dicitur pulsare vir-
gilium qui indecori corporis et habitus fuit.”
He had no doubt met with that statement,
which is repeated by Cruquius’ Scholiast,
but how much reliauce is to be placed upon
it cannot easily be determined. Weichert
supports it. Madvig (Opusc. p. 60) rejects
it. ⁴ Rustieius’ belongs to ⁴ tonso,¹ and ⁴ de-
fluit' is absolute, ‘hangs down! ‘Male'
belongs to ‘laxus.' (See v. 45, and C. i.
17. 25, n.). To be slipshod (μείζω τοῦ
ποδὸς ὑποδήματα φορεῖν, Tbeophr. char.
4) has always been the proverbial charac-
teristic of a sloven. ⁴⁴ Nec vagus iri-laxa
pes tibi pelle natet '’ (Ovid, A. A. i. 516).
‘At’ is repeated in the same way as hero
by Cicero, in his eighth letter ω Caelius
(Ad Fam. ii. 15)2 “ Puerum, inquies ἓ At
quaestorem, at nobilem adolescentem, at
omnium fere exemplo.'' In Verr. ii. 5. 1:
⁴⁴ at est bonus imperator, at felix ;'' ii. 3.

4: ⁴⁴ at sermone, at literis, at humanitate '

ejus delectamini.”

34. hoc sub corpora] Thes reading of
Lambinus, Torrentius, and others supported
by a few respectable MSS. ⁴ pectore: is
justly condemned by Bentley.

35. Concute,] The metaphorisprobably
derived from the shaking of a eloak, or any
thing of that sort, to see if there is any thing
hid in it. Orelli calls this ⁴⁴ imaginem
desumptam ab eo qui furem concutit,'' that
is, it means ⁴ to search,’ as suspected per·
sons are searched by the police. ⁴ Excutio’
is used in that connexion in Plautus (Aulul.

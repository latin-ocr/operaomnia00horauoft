HORATII FLAOGI

ARG UMENT.

The way to live, Licinius, is neither rashly to tempt nor cowardly to sear the stol-m. The
golden mean secures a man at once from the pinching· of poverty and the envy of
wealth. The loftiest objects fall soonest and most heavily. In adversity or prosperity
the wise man looks for change. Storms come and go. Bad times will not always be
bad. Apollo handles the lyre as well as the bow. Iu adversity show thyself breve,

in prosperity take in sail.

REc'rms vives, Licini, neque altum
Semper urgendo neque, dum proceHas
Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo

Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem 5
Diligit tutus caret obsoleti
Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda

Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus et celsae graviore casu

10

Decidunt turres feriuntque summos

Fulgura montes.

5. Horace's language comes near to that
of Aristotle (Polit. iv. 12), καὶ σώζον-
ται δ’ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν ουτοι (οἱ μέσοι)
μάλιστα τῶν πολιτῶν· οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοὶ τῶν
ἀλλοτρίων ὥσπερ οι πένητες ἐπιθυμοῦσιν
οὔτε τιῆς τούτων ἕτεροι. Aristotle quotes
a maxim of Phocy lides to the same effect,
πολλὰ μέσοισιν ἄριστα· μέσος θέλω“ εν πό-
λει εἶναι. That every virtue is a mean
between two vices is a doctrine laid down
in the Ethics of this 'author (Nic. Eth. ii.
7), and Cicero (de Off. i. 25) says, “ Nun-
quam iratus qui accedit ad, poenam me-
diocritatem illam tenebit quae est inter
nimium et parum.''

6. obsoleti] That which has gone out
of use; therefore old and decayed. For
the various applications of the word see
Forcell.

9. Saep epins] Burmann's conjecture (οιι
ovid, Heroid. xiv. 39), ‘saeviusl is
strongly defended by Jani, who thinks

‘saepius 'much too weak, especially for so
elaborate a poem. Sanadon adopts ‘ sae·
vius’ as agreeing better with ‘graviore
msu, ' which, he says, would have been

‘frequentiore casu’ had the true reading
been‘ saepius! Dacier' is opposed to himg,
and so are all the MSS„ the Scholiasta,
and every edition earlier than the eighteentli
century (Burmann edits‘ saepius ¹), and all

the editors of this excep t Fen

approves of‘ saevius' only, as it would
seem, because Bentley does not, and yet ’

Bentley carnes the system of eo

aesthetical principles fu· enough. The -

same editors follow one mother in reading
‘'excelsae for‘ et celsae!

The cffitp passage containing this mustra-

tion is one of Herodotus (vii. 10), ὁρᾳς τὰ ⁷.

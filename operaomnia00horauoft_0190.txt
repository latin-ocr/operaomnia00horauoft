of Aristophanes (Thesm. 163), which it is
not improbable Horace may have had in
mind. Speaking of the combination of music
and poetry, he says of the great lyric poets
>that they ἐμιτροφόρουν τε καὶ διεκλῶντ’
Ἰωνικῶς.-Τ118 function of teaching to
dance was performed by slaves, Pantomimi,
whom Ovid (A. A. iii. 351) calls ‘⁴ artifices
lateris, scenae spectacula,” aud Seneca
“mancipia pantomimorum '' (Ep. 47). Ti-
berius passed a decree that they should
never appear in public except on the stage
(Tac. Ann. i. 77), which explains Ovid’s
expression.

23. Jam nunc] Τ118 meaning of ‘jam
nunc ’is sufficiently marked in A. Ρ. 43:

“orgiums haec virtus erit et Venus, aut ego
or,

Ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia
dici.’'

‘ Nunc ¹ is ‘ now,’ and ‘ jam ’ gives intensive
force to ‘ nunc! ‘Jam jamque ' expresses
‘ what is expected every moment' (Key,
L. G. 1450, e.)‚ but has not happened yet.
The commentators mix up ‘jam nunc ' and
‘jam jam, ' as if they were synonymous.
So Orelli, on C. ii. 1. 17, explains⁴ jam
nunc minaci, '&.,c thus‘ ‘fingit se jamjam
vel ante lectam Asinii curam in medias res
abreptum esse) Horace says directly a
girl has grown up she is trained by lasci-
vious teaching and turns 1181· thoughts to
unchaste pleasures. The expression ‘de te-
nero ungui’ is taken from the Greek ἐξ
απαλῶνόνύχων, which signifies‘ from ten-
der years‚’ when the 118118 are delicate, and
such is the meaning here3 but it does not
contradict ‘matura’ as some suppose: the
expression will apply to a girl 111 1118 earliest
stage of womanhood. 1 do not follow Orel-
li’s punctuation. Cicero, 111 1118 8111111 181181·
10 Lentulus, says, ‘⁴ praesta teeum qni mihi

a teneris ut (111ωοί dicunt unguiculis es 003-
1111118.” The Greeks appear from Cicero's
statement to have used the phrase prover·
bially, but it is only found m 811 E pigram of
Autoyriiedon in the Anthology (Br. ii.

in which the writer probably had tegani to
Horace’ s ode, as Mitsch. observes:

τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς Α’σιής ὀρχηστρίδα, τὴν κακο-
oxzffgssig' ἐξ ἁπαλῶν κινυμένην ὂνῦχων,
αἶνέῳ οὐχ ὅτι πάντα παθαίνεται, οὐδ’ ὅτι

τὰξίΐξὶὰς ἁπαλως ὦόε και ὧδε χέράς.

26. Inter—vina,] Τ118 sameformoccurs
in Epp. i. 7. 283 ‘ ad vina’ in C. iv. 5. 31.
27. imper-missa] This word occurs no
where else. ‘Intermissa' and ‘improvisa’
have thus got into some MSS. in place of
the true reading. ⁴ Inconcessus' is used
by Virgil and Ovid, and Horace uses‘ inter—
dicta. ' Orelli contradicts himself. He hera
treats‘ impermissa’ as ‘interpolatim’ but
inhisV. L„ on iv. 7. lo, where‘ imperi-
’has got into one of his MSS. for
‘interitum’ he say s this makes it very
doubtful which is 1118 true reading here,
‘impermissa' or ‘ intermissa!

29. Sed jussa coram] The connivauca
of the husband at the wickedness of 1118
wife is touched by Juvenal in his 111-81
Satire (56, sqq.). Metals appear' to have
been the chief articles imported stom Spain,
with red lead and those stenes which were
polished into miri-ors, whatever stones those
may have been. See Plin. N. H. iii. 3.

32. Dedecorum] Bentley’s interpretation
of this as‘ res pro persona’ is hardly worth
noticing (see 1118 note on i. 37. 9, sub 6.11).
Forcellini gives uo other instance of‘ pre-
tiosus' in 811 active sense, ‘one who gives a
large price. Ulpian' s definition 0141118318-

ter' is this: “Magistrum navis accipere

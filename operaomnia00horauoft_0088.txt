CARMEN XXVI.

At the time this ode was written it would appear that the affairs of tho Parthians were ‘'¹-

occupying a good deal of attention at Rome, since Horace speaks of himself as the only ” ’
one who gave no heed to them. The circumstances that may be supposed to 118 referred ι ‘s
to are to be gathered from the following account. Ῑ11 the year A.u.c. 724, Phraates (see - j
Dict. Biog. Arsaces XV.) being on the Parthian throne, and having by his cruelties made *3¹
himself obnoxious to his subjects, Tiridates, likewise one of the. fimily of modoine, =
was set up as a rival to Phraates, but was defeated in his attempt todeffironehimj aud ’
fled for protection that same year to Augustus, who was then‘ 111 Syria, astu tho death of ’
Μ. Antonius. (Dion Cass. li. 18.) Shortly afterwards, however, the Parthianssueoeeded 111 .

getting rid of their king, and Tiridates was called to the throne.1n A. u c. 729, Phraaten,

having obtained assistance from the Scythians, returned and recovered his kingdom, tud ' ¹

Tiridates fied to Augustus once more for protection. He was then in Spain. The fol-
lowing is Justin's account (though professing to give a particular history of Parthian

affairs he does not refer to Tiridates’ former ill success) τ Phraates, he says, elated with his ·
success against M. Antonius, grew more cruel than ever, and in consequence ‘⁴ in exilium :

a populo suo pellitur. Itaque cum magno tempore finitimas civitates ad pomum
Scythas precibus fatigasset, Scytharum maximo auxilio in regnum restituitur. Boe

absente regem Parthi Tiridatem quendam constituerant3 qui audito adventu Scyflnrum >
cum magna amicorum manu ad Caesarem in Hispaniam bellum tunc temporis gerentem 3
profugit obsidem Caesari minimum filium Phraatis ferens quem negligentius cumdium j
rapuerat. Quo cognito Phraates legatos statim ad Caesarem mittit, servum suum Tifi- , ²

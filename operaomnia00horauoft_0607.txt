Nn, admirari prope res est una, Numici,

Solaque quae possit faeere et servare beatum.

Hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certis

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla

Imbuti spectent: quid censae munera terrae, 5
Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

Ludiora quid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,

Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore!

Qui timet his adversa fere miratur eodem ⁵

Quo cupiens paeto; pavor oet utrobique molestus

Improvisa simul species exterret utrumque.
Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne‚ quid ad rem,
Si quidquid vidit melius pejusve sua spe

'ofin' ἢ δεισιδαιμονέας ἣ ἄλλου τινὸς
πόθους (Diog. Iam* lx. 45), was one of
the fundamental doen-ines of Democritus

μετρέα, α’θσμβέα, ἀθαυμαστί ια. But before
him ras had held the same notion,

and Heraclitus before either of them, and
tho same doctrine was held ιιι one form or
other by nearly every school of Greek phi-

losophy as the foundation os morals and of
happiness. In the theory os the sensual

Epp. i. l. 18, ιι..) Epion-us and Zeno
equally found it necessary to their views

sayings imputed to them by Diogenes
Laertius and other writers, and might infer
systems.
It is this aelf-control that Horace says is
the only means of making a man happy
and keeping him so. ‘Nil admirari’ can
onlybesaidtobeneoaesarymthisrule
when admiration amounts to a stupid won-

der, exeomve sear, excitement, or other
effecta by which the judgment ιε misled and
the passinus roused injuriously. Horace
had too much sense to reoommend a stupid
apathy, or that affectation of seu-possession
which is not unoommon, and is the height

is here equivalent to δεισιδαιμονία, a aupe-
stitious dread of the influenoae of the hea- >
venly bodies which acts upon vulgu- minda.
The beet MSS.. and most of them, have

‘spectent’ A few quoted by Fea (who
adopts the indicative) have ⁴ spemn& which
some other editors prefer. 1 think Honoe
is referring generally to men of philosophieal
mind rather than to any particular sect or
individuals, and therefore that the subjunc-
tive is wanted. (See C. i. l. 3, n.) .

is above. Horaoe says that sear and desire

want of that eqnanimity which he oom-

the astonishment of sear as well as of ad-
miration, and so does‘ stupet’ freqoently,
and ⁴ exterret' applies like ἐκπλήσσειν to
either state of mind. ‘Torpet’does the
same. (See S. ii. 7. 95.)

406 HORATII FLAOGI

SATI RE VII.

I do not think many persons will agree with Franke in his high estimato os this
Satira, the best of its kind, he says, and yielding to none or even preferable to all
others, in elegance of composition, suavity of diction, and dramatic power. He wishes
to prove that it was not the earliest of the Satires, as most commentatore suppose, some
judging from the quality, others with more reason from the subject of it. The subject
is a dispute, travestied Ι think without much humour, between one of the officers on
Brutus' staff and a merchant of Clazomenae (a town on the gulf of Smyrna), arising it
may be supposed out of some money transactions. Horace treats the matter much in
the same way as the dispute got up between the two parasites for the amusement of
Maecenas and his friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51, sqq.). He no doubt had some reason
for disliking Rupilius, which the Scholiasts supply, whether with any sufficient authority
it is impossible to say. They tell us that this man's native place was Praeneste (which
may be gathered from v. 28); that he was banished from that town by his fellow-citizens3
that he then served in Africa in the army of Attius Varus, propraetor of Cn. Pompeius3
that he was received into favour by Julius Caesar and made Praetor; that after caesai-’s
death he was proscribed by the triumvirs and joined the army of Brutus. Finally, that
he was disgusted at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a military tribune, and oon-
tinually insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satire. Persius, the Scho—
liasts say, was born of a Greek father and a Roman mother. Beyond this, which may or
may not be true, we know nothing about him but *what we gather from this Satira, that
he was a wealthy man and carried on a large business of some kind at Clazomenae.
Dillenbr. supposes he was employed as contractor for the supply of corn in Brutus’ army,
and that his dispute with Rupilius arose out of transactions connected with this business,
on which, from his experience, he was employed by Persius3 for Dillenb. and others (see
Spohn in Jahn⁷s edition of Horace, ed. 2nd, p. 257) identify the hero of this Satira with
P. Rupilius Munenia, the Roman ‘ eques’ and ‘ publicanus,' recommended by Cicero to
Crassipes the Quaestor of Bithynia (Ad Fam. xiii. 9). These theories are hardly worth
mentioning in a case of so much obscurity. Comm. Cruq. says Persius was a ‘ negotiator ¹ at
Clazomenae. But the ‘ negotiatores’ (money—lenders) in Asiasnd the other provinceswere
not natives (as Persius seems to have been), but Roman ⁴ equites! They were an important
class, who gave no little trouble to the governors (see Cic. ad Qu. Fr. l. i. ep. 1, c. 1),
and their commercial transactions in Asia particularly were on a large scale. Τὴο disputa
arose when Brutus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in A.u.c. 7 11-712 (see
note on v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satirc was written it is impossible to say; not
long, I think. It may have been made on the spot, and shown to those who would find
most amusement in it, in the camp. I think this is more likely than that Horace should
have reverted to such a subject after his arrival at Rome, where the scene must have been
unknown or little known, when those who might have enjoyed the joke were most of
them dead or in exile, and his own feeling against Rupilius must have been forgotten in
the scenes that he had since gone through. The poem is a mere fragment in the dramatic
style so admirably sustainerl in the ninth satire; but in this there is no character brought
out, none of the happy touches and traits of nature which there are found in every line.
Certainly no two poems could bear less evidence of being the work of the same mind,
and this may be taken as some indication of the early composition of the present one3
but 1 rest more on the circumstance that the point of the story would have been lost in a
great measure any length of time after the event it refers to. Perhaps we may infer from
the abruptness of the conclusion that Horace intended when he began to make a longer
poem, but found his materials or his time or his spirit fail.

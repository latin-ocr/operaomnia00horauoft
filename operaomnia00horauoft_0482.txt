fish, would be out of season and coarse.
The ‘lupus’ is said to have been of the
pike kind.-

33. Ostia sub Tusci .’] ‘ Sub ' with
the accusative in phrases of place, seems to
have the meaning it has in phrases of time,
immediately after (see Epod. ii. 44, n.); so
that ‘ sub ostia ¹ would be ‘ immediately on
entering the mouth.' But it usually in these
phrases follows a verb of motion, and means
.‘ close up to ;' and if it be so understood
here, the verb of motion must be supplied,
‘ as you approach close up to.’ The Tiber
is called Tuscus amnis, as (C. i. 20. 5) it
is said to be Maecenas' ‘ paternum flumen,'
because it rises in Etruria.

34. Mullum] The mullet was a fish
in high estimation for a great number of
years. Martial speaks of one of two pounds
as the least that should be put upon a fine
dish:

‘Grandia ne viola parvo chrysendeta mullo3
Ut minimum libras debet habere duasss'

(xiv. 97.)

This Pliny says was a size it rarely ex-
ceeded. Juvenal tells a story of a man
who bought a mullet of six pounds at a
thousandg sesterces for each pound (iv. 15).
The bearded mullet, as it was called, was
held in highest esteem.

36. Quia scilicet illis] ‘ Illis ’ does not
refer to the more remote object here, but
to the nearer, as in v. 27 (see note). ‘ His'
refers to the mullet.

40. At vos, Praesentes Ausim] ‘Now
may ye, O potent south winds.' ‘’At is a

particle of exclamation when a sudden

emotion is expressed‚ as mentioned above
(Epod. v. l). The winds are invoked as
deities. As to ‘praesens ' in this applica·
tion, see C. i. 35. 2

41, Quamquam]

is gorged and seeks stimulante!

42. rhombus] This fish, if it was the
turbot, was not less esteemed by the Ro·
mans than by ourselves. The finest were
caught in the Adriatic, near Ravenna,
whence the fish that caused such a sensa·
tion in J uvenal's story (iv. 37, sqq.) he calls
“Hadriaci spatium admirabile rhombi. ''
But it is not certain that we know what
fish is meant by the ‘ rhombus! Respect-
ing ⁴ rapula ² and ‘inulae,' see below, S. 8.
51. On the use of eggs at the ‘promul-
sis,' see S. i. 3. 6. The sense in which
Horace uses the words ⁶ pauper ⁷ and ‘ rex '
is no where more marked than here (see C·
i. 1. 18,andc.i.4. 14).

47. Galloni praeconis erae acipensere]

“Hic est qui primus acipenserem conviviis

the former have been reserved by Cicero
(de Finn. ii. 8), in whic he repeats the in-
dignation of Laelius against this epicure,
his own taste being, as we have seen (S. ii.

1.72, n. ), of the simplest kind. -

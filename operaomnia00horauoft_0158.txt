Africa ; neque Attali

HORATII FLACGI

Ignotus heres regiam occupavi ;

Nec Laconicas mihi

Trahunt honestae purpuras clientae:

At fides et ingeni

Benigne, vena est, pauperemque dives 10

Me petit ; nihil supra

Deos lacesso, nec potentem amicum

Largiora flagito,

Satis beatus unicis Sabinis.

Truditur dies die,

15

Novaeque pergunt interire lunae.

Tu secanda marmora

Locas sub ipsum funus, et sepulcri

Immemor struis domos

Marisque Baiis obstrepentis urges 20

“ De marmore omni quod Carystos invenit
Quod Phrygia Synnas, Afra quod Nomas
Etutjlltihld virenti fonte lavit Eurotas.”

Tibullus mentions three sorts, and has

Horace’s word ⁴ trabes' in the following
lines (iii. 3. 13) :—

⁴⁴ Quidve domus prodest Phrygiis innixa
Tass‘ssissssffssisse tuis, sive Caryste tuis.
Et nemori} in domibus sacros imitantia
Atii-lasscue trabes marmoreumque
solum?''

Propertius has a passage very like this of
Horace (iii. 2. ll, sqq.) :—
“ Quod (1'. e. quamvis) non Taenariis domus
est mihi fulta columnis
Nec camera auratas inter eburna trabes
At musae comites et carmina cara le-
genti,'’ &c.

5. Attali] See C. i. 1. 12, n. The
meaning is, ‘I have not had the luck to
Δ come to an unexpected estate, as the Ro-
mans came in for the property of Attalus!

8. honestae—clientae .·] The form ⁴ cli-
entes¹ is found in the old editions, and
‘ cliens' is of common gender. But Charisius
the Grammarian says that ‘ clientae’ is the
proper form here. The same occurs in Plau-
tus (Mil. Glor. iii. l. 192), ‘⁴ Habeo eccillam
meam clientam meretricem adolescentu-
lam;'' (Rudens, iv. l, 2) “jam clientas
repperi atque ambas forma scitula atque
aetatula.’' It is not easy for us to enter

into the state of society, which is repre-
sented by the words ‘honestae—dianna:
ssgffissffi {22⁶3 mmet& ῖζίἳΐιξζ
of rich patroni, and rendering them service
in return. But I do not feel sure that this
is what Horace means, and 1 have seen no
satisfactory explanation of the words ‘ho-
nestae clientae! ΜΓ. Long has suggested
to me that they may refer< to the rustic
women on a man's farma, the wives of the
coloni. The formal and legal connexion of
client and patron had nndergone great
changes, and the nse of tho terma had
become extended before Horace wrote3 at
which time, and still more asten-warda,
bodies of voluntas-y retainers were -en-
couraged by men of wealth, who liked the
display and the consequence such attendance
gave them, and purchased it at a costly rate.
The daily dole, which went by the name of
‘spot-tuln: was not established till some
years after Horace wrote3 but the system
which led to it existed in his day, though
not to the same extent that it asta-warda
reached. On the subject of the ¹ clien-
tela ' in its regular sense, sec Smith’s Dict.

13(ι Beniqna vena] This metaphor is
from a mine; but Ovid (Trist. iii. 14. 33)
takes the same word for arunning stream :—

⁴⁴ Ingenium fregere meum mala cujus et
Foagtienfecundus parvaque vena fuit?

16. interire] This word seems to be an

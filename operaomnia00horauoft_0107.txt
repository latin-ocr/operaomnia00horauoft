ARGUMENT.

Queen· of Antium, all—powerful to exalt or to dehac, the poor tenant cultivator worships
thee md the mariner on the deep. Thou art fem-ed by the sange Dacisn and nomad
Scythiam, by ⁸11 dues and natione, γει byproud latium herself, by royal mothers
mbung for their sons, and kings fem-ing for their crowm. Neooesity with her stem
emblem goes before thee.1·10pe and Fidelity go with thee when thou leuvest the

house of prosperum while false fi-iends fall away.
Pramo ctos-1· as he goeth to conquer Βτίίείης preserve the fioeh leviee destined for the
But. It repenteth us of our civil atrise and impious crimes. Let the sword be reoest

and whewed for the Scythian and the Atab.

Ο n1vA‚ gratum quae regis Antium,
,Praesens vel imo tollere de gradu
Ἀ Mortale corpus vel superbos
Vertere funeribus triumphos,
Te pauper ambit sollicita prece 5
Ruris colonus, te dominam aequoris
Quicmque Bithyna lacessit
Carpathium pelagus carina.
Te Dacus asper, te profugi Scythae
Urbesque gentesque et Latium ferox 10
Regumque matres barbarorum et ⁴
Purpurei metuunt tyranni,
Injurioso ne pede promas
Stantem columnam, neu populus frequens ,
Ad arma cessantes, ad arma 15
Concitet imperiumque frangat.

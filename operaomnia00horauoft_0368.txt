Maestum ac sollicitum est cantoris morte Tigelli.

Contra hic, ne prodigus esse

Dicatur metuens, inopi dare nolit amico 5
Frigus quo duramque famem propellere possit.

Hunc si perconteris avi cur atque pai-entis

Praeclaram ingrata stringat malus ingluvie rein,

Omnia conductis coemens obsonia numinis, ¹

Respondet. Laudatur ab his, culpatur ab illis.

Dives agris, dives positis in fenore nummis:

race's expression “barathrumque macelli ”
(Epp. i. 15. 31). It is not necessary to go
so fai· back as the age of the Scholiasts to
get at least as good guesses at the meaning
as these. Festus derives the name from
⁴ blatea,' which he says signifies mud that
sticks to the shoes in dii-ty westher. (See
Forcell.) There are no means of arriviug
at a nearer interpretation than that of the
Scholiasts‚ who say Horace means profligate
and abandoned persons in general. See
note on S. ii. 3. 166.

3. Ίῖρεῖίἰ.] See Introduction.

6. propellere] The greater part of the
MSS. favour this reading, as Bentley ad-
mits, though he reads ⁴ depellere.' I think
‘ propellere' is the least likely of the two
to have been substituted. Cicero (de
Finibus, iv. 25) says, ‘⁴ Vacemus an crucie-
mur dolore3 frigus famem propulsare necne
possimus ;’' and Tacitus (Ann. xiv. 24):
⁴⁴ Carne pecudum propulsare famem adactil'
which comes very near to ‘propellere‚' as
Bentley admits. Ven. (1483) has ⁴ propel-
lere! Nearly all the editions of the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries have the
othei· word. There is not much to choose
between them. Orelli's three Berne and
St. Galle MSS. have ⁴ propellere.’

8. inyrata strinyat malus inqluvie rem ,]
‘⁴ Ingrata: sine gratia: quia quicquid ei
praestiteris gratiam tibi habere non potest.
Ingluvies autem dicitur voracitas gulae.'’
(Acron.) An ungrateful belly is an insatia-
ble o)ne. So Lucretius uses the word (iii.

‘⁴ Deinde animi ingratam naturam pascere
semper,
Atque explere, bonis rebus satiareque nun-
quam.

⁴ Stringat ’ is variously iuterpreted. Forcel-

lini says it is ⁴ paullatim absumere! Orelli
adopts the interpretation of Cruquius’ Scho-
liast, who says the metaphor is taken from
the stripping of trees of their leaves. But
‘stringere' means ‘to ‚' and Horace
says this man put all his estate 111 his bully

9. conductis—nummata This is not 0
common use of ‘conductus‚’ for ‘foenori
sumptus! Juvenal has it (S. xi. 46)=
‘⁴ Conducta pecunia Romae Et coram do-
minis consumitur. ’' The ο pposito term to

‘ssconducere ‘flocare is only once found 111
this connexion (Plaiit. Mostell. iii. l. 4),.,
“locare argenti nemini numinum queo-’³
‘Animi parvi ’corresponds ω’ inopia pusil
lique animi’ in S.4. 17.

12. Fufidius] Ofthis person the Scho-
liasts 1011 110 nothing but what the &tire
tells, that he was “avarus quidam foene-
rator.'' What resemblance Orelli can see
between this person and the Fufidius re-
ferred to by Cicero in his speech against
Piso (0. 35) it is hard to imagine. The
words‘ vappa 'and‘ nebulo’ have beenox-
plained above (S. 1. 104).

14. Quina& liic capiti mercedes exsecat]

He contrived to squeeze out of 1110Ι prin· -

cipal of the money he lent interest 'at 60
per cent. by the year, —that 10, 5 per cent.
by the mouth, which was five times the
legal rate. ‘Centesima‚’ or l per cent. by
the month, was the regular rate of interest
at this time; and‘ quinas' means ‘quinas
centesimas.' Verres lent public money on
his own account to the‘ publimni' in Sicily

⁴ binis centesimis,’ which was double the
usual rate (Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 70). 'rbat
was bad enough. Juvenal (ix. 7) mentions
a man who was ready to give ‘triplicem
usuram,’ but found no 0110 soolish enough
to trust him. Fufidius contrived to get

this cnormous interest (⁴sanguinolentas

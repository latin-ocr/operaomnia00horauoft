'nno common insu-iption An Mxncumux, adopted by Beufley and others, is plainly
wrong, nudedmlated to mislead. The inscription should be An ram-omnus, if any
thing;.for Men-cury disappears aster the first two venes. The miraclesalluded to, except

ARGUMENT.

Merum, who didst tach Amphion to move stenes, and thou, lyre, onoe dumb now wel·
come at feast and festival, tune me a atr-uin to which even Lyde, though she be fiee
ns the young eolt, must attend. Thou charmest tigers, woods, streame, and hell’s bloody
nmtinel, md Ixion, and 'my-us, and the daughters os Danae. Iaet Lyde hear of their
aime and punishment, and how one was merciful and spared her young husband’s
life, nying, ‘⁴ Rise up ; begone, lest the deepof death ovet-take thee. They have sprung
upotnthairprey. Myhenrt is not ns their beart. Ι willdotheenolmm. Letmy

’ futhei· do with me as he will, yet go thou while night and love protect thee. Farewell,
md when Ι ιω gone engnve a word of sorrow on my tomb.”

Mercuri,—nam te docilis magistro
Movit Amphion lapides canendo,—
Tuque testudo resonare septem
Callida nervis,
Nec loquax olim neque grata, nunc et 5
Divitum mensis et amica templis,
Dic modos Lyde quibus obstinatas
Applieet aures,
Quae velut latis equa trima campis
Ludit exsultim metuitque tangi, ιο
Nuptiarum expers et adhuc protervo
Cruda marito.
Tu potes tigres comitesque silvas
Ducere et rivos celeres morari ;
Gessit immanis tibi blandienti 15

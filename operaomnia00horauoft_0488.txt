458 HORATII FLAGGI

Ac venerata Ceres ita culmo surgeret alto,

Explicuit vino contractae seria frontis.

Saeviat atque novos moveat Fortuna tumultus,

Quantum hinc imminuet?

Quanto aut ego parcius aut voe,

Ο pueri, nituistis ut huc novus incola venit?
Nam propriae telluris herum natura neque illum

Nec me nec quemquam statuit ε nos expulit ille;

Postremum expellet certe vivacior heres.
Nunc ager Umbreni sub nomine, nuper ofellae
Dictus, erit nulli proprius, sed cedet in usum

Nunc mihi nunc alii. Quocirca vivite fortes

Fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus.''

viii PREFAGE.

has added them to his own commentary in a separate form. These
scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Oomm. Gruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentaries of Acron aud Por-
phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authorities.
The readings of these three Scholiasts help out the MSS„ though
sometimes they are not supported by any that are known now-

The editions thatI have consulted Ι will not tire the reader by
enumerating. No classical author has been edited and commented
upon so often as Horace. The editions I have always referred to
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius
(1519), with the scholia of Acron and Porphyrion, Lambinus,
Oruquius (for his commentator), Torrentius, Gesner, Doering, Dillen-

cious. Ι have often referred to the French editors Sanadon and
Dacier, but their judgment is not to be trusted. The old edition of
Landini, published at Florence in 1482, and reprinted at Venice the
next year, isin my possession, and will be found frequently referred to
for various readings as “ Ven. 1483‚” or simply “ Ven.'' Fea has a

are much indebted to the learning and diligence os Heindorf, whose
copious notes and judicious prefaces must be of use to any one who

His notes on law-terms are valuable, but iu such matters I haye
been chiefly indebted to the judgment of my friend and coadjutor
Mr. Long, whose advice I have likewise followed in many other-
particulars.

I have not entered at any length upon the chronology of Horace's
poems. I have referred to the subject in the Introduction, and

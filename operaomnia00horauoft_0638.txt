608 HORATII FLAGGI

EPISTLE XII.

A.U.c. 734«.

Iccius, to whom this Epistle is addressed, has been mentioned, with all that is known
of him, in the Introduction to C. i. 29, and Pompeius Grosphus in C. ii. 16. It is a
letter of introduction for Grosphus to Iccius, who was employed in mannging Agrippa's
estates in Sicily.

It is possible Horace may have had a letter from Iccius in which he wrote something
that gave rise to the reflections with which the Epistle begin„ but to affirm from what
Horace here says that Iccius was a miser or a misanthrope, or any thing else but a good
and sensible man, any one who reads the Epistle with the smallest attention must see is
absurd. The Argument will show the spirit of it, and convince any body that Horace
means nothing but compliments to his friend.

Τὴθ date is not difficult to make out. It must have been written shortly aster the
successes of Agrippa against the Cantabri, who, having been subdued by Augustus in
A.u.c. 730, afterwards broke out again and were finally conquered and broken by Agrippa
A.u.c. 734, in the autumn of which year this Epistle was written. (See v.. 29.) At that
time the close of Tiberius' expedition to Armenia, and the restoration of the standards of
Crassus would be news just fresh.

ARGUMENT.

Use what you get with discretion, Iccius, and no man can be better off than you. Be
content. He is not poor who has enough. As long as you have good health the
riches of kings could add nothing to your happiness. Accustom yourself to simple
fare and you will never leave it off, though you should be turned into gold, whethe- it
be that money makes no change in our natures, or because, like a wisc man, you count
every thing less than virtue. We may wonder why Democritus should have nogleooed
his goods to absorb himself in his studieS‚ when we see how you are able in the midst
of sordid employments to lift your thoughts to ¹the skiae, and to search into the springs
of nature, and to balance rival systems.

But be all this as it may, 1 beg you to receive Pompeius Grosphus, and whatever he aska
let him have, for he will ask nothing that is not right. Such friends are cheaply
purchased.

If you would know what is going on at Rome, the Cantabrian has fallen before the yslour '
of Agrippa, the Armenian of Tiberius. Phraates has done homage and accepted the
yoke of Caesar. Plenty is showering an abundant harvest upon Italy.

Viresque, et addis cornua pauperi;

his emendation because it is an emendation,
but thinks if any MS. were to exhibit his
reading it would be received by acclamation.
Orelli’s B has ‘numine,’ and one or two

verbial use. Speaking of a supper, he says,

“Sit expedita ‚sit parca: Socraticis tantum

reading of the Scholiasts and nearly all the
MSS. and editions, Bentley prefers the pre-
sent tense.

1 l . Narratur εἰρήκει· Catonis] Plutardi,
in his life of cato Uticensis, says he drank

lise, and Senecasays the same. Someedi-
tors therefore haveys supposed Horace means
toreferto him. But he isnotalludingto
the intemperate use of wine, and‘ prisci’
can only apply to the elder Cato, as in

“priscis memorata Catonibus atque Cethe-
'.(Epp ii. 2. 117).‘ ‘Prisci: antiquioris.
ιιοιι Uticensis” (Acron).

appliest a gentle spur to the usually ungenial
temper! ‘'Duro ingenio ’does not, 1 think,
as Bentley says, signify‘ the genius that finds
it hard to express itself,' but the roeerved
temper whose sympathia are not easily
drawn out, as in Terence (Phorm. iii. 2. 12),
“ Adeon’ ingenio esse duro te atque inexo-
rabili-’¹ ‘ Sapientiam ’ Dillenbr. supposes
to be said ironically, signifying the Sir
Oracles, “ who therefore only are esteemed
wise for saying nothing.” 1 think it has a
more serious and kindly meaning, and ap·
pliae to the philosophical and thoughtful
(as ‘ sapientia’ is put for philosophy, C. i.
34. 2), who have little to do with mirth till
they are brought out of themselves by ebear-
ful company. It is said that inhis odes Ho-
race always uses the termination ‘ ium' for
the genitive plural of nouns ending in ‘ ens,’
and for participles the termination ⁸ tum!
But the instancoe of either are not nume-
rous enough to determine a rule, and the
so-called nouns are usually participles, u

‘sapiens ¹ is. Ovid most probably had this
passage of Horace in his mind when he
wrote the following verses (A. A. i. 237,

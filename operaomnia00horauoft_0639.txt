EPISTOLARUM I. 12. , 609

Faucmns Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si recte frueris non est ut- copia major

Ab J ove.‹10nari possit tibi.

Tolle querelas ;

Pauper enim non est eui rerum suppetit usus,

Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil 5
¹ Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus ut te

Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret;

Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit, 10
Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.

Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox ;

1. stne-tibae Aqn'ppae] From what
sources Agrippa derived his immense wealth
we do not know. From this E pistle we

ν lmrn thot he had estatoe' m Sicily, probably

given him aster his successes against Sex.
Pompeius. Horace means to say to Iccius

unthehaegotngoodpostmdmaybe

⁷ varycomfortableif heis caresul. He pro-

bably got a per-centage on what he col-
lected. Heis generallycalled the‘ procu-
rahir’ of Agrippa, and that as a general
tem mayexpreas his office, since ‘procu-
rator' was one who acoed for another with
lii-authority. He mightbecalled‘ coactor'
as collector of rents, but probably his super-
vision was general. But he must not be
to have been Agrippa’ s ‘villicus’
The‘ villims' was a slave (see below, Epp.
4. eui rerum suppetit unm] ‘Rerum
usus' here seems to mean the supply of
things needful. ⁴ Suppet0,¹ meaning ‘ to be
sufficiens* ocmrs in Epod.xvii. 64. ⁴ Pau-
per'ishereusedmorein thesenseof
privation than Horace generally uses it.
5. Si ventri bene, εἰ lateri] This seems
tao be a translation of Solon’s verses, quoted

by Plutarch (vit. c. 2), who says of him

πλοῦτον δ’ οὐκ ἐθαύμαζεν ἀλλὰ καί φησιν
ὁμοιως πλουτεῖν ᾦ τε-

πολὸς ἄργυρός ἐστι
καὶ χρυσὸς και γῆς πυροφόρου πεδία,
ἵπποι θ’ ἡμίονοί τε, καὶ ᾧ μόνα ταῦτα
πάρεστι

γαστρί τε καὶ πλευρῆς καὶ ποσὶν ἁβρὰ
παθεῖν.
7. positorum] ‘Ponere' is the usual

word for putting dishes on the table, as

observed ou S. ii. 2. 23. Here fine dishes
are meant, as we can teu by the context.
The nettle ⁴ urtica' forms an ingredient in
the broth of poor people in this country,
and still more in Scotland. ‘Protinus'
means ⁴ right on,’ and is applied in various
ways. Here it means ¹ in an uninterrupted
course,' tint is, ‘ always! ¹ Ut ' means‘ even
supposing‚’ as in Epod. ἰ.21. ⁴ Confestimss

‘straightway,’ has the same root as ⁸ foefinof
which Gellius (xvi. 14) says is akin to

‘fossus' 'though ‘ Fortunae-rivus ' occurs
no where else in extant writers, it seems, as
Orelli says, to ⁴have been a proverbial ex-
Pfflssgfozmmm mutare] Homoe says the
same in a different applieation elsewhere
(Epod. iv. 5):

“ Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genus-’¹

12. Miramur ei Democriti] 1 do not
agree with Orelli in his interpretation of
this passage. (See Argument.) Democri-
tus of Abdera had a considerable patrimony,
and he is said to have entertained Xerxes
when (as Herodotus relatos, viii. 120) he
stopped at Abdera on his return from
Greeoe. (See Diog. Laert. ix. 34.) He
travelled a great part of his life and squan-
dered his means in‘ this way. (Diog. 1..
iv. 35. 39.) Cicero says hewas reported
to have put out his ey es to prevent his
mind from being distracted, and that he
neglected his patrimony aud left his lands
uncultivated. (De Finn. v. 29; Tuae-Disp.
v. 39.) 111 whatever way he mted his
goodsitseems his namehad passedintoa
proverb.

HORATII FLAOGI

Agrestem, veluti succinctus cursitat hospes
Continuatque dapes nee non verniliter ipsis
Fungitur officiis, praelambens omne quod affert.

Rebus agit laetum convivam, cum subito ingens
Valvarum strepitus leetis excussit utrumque.
Currere per totum pavidi conclave, magisque
Exanimes trepidare simul domus alta Molossis

Personuit canibus.

Tum rusticus: ‘ Haud mihi vita

Est opus hac,' ait, ‘ et valeas3 me silva cavusque

107 . veluti cuc-cinctus] ⁴ Like one tucked
up ' as the slaves when on duty. (See S. i.
5. 5,11.) The duties of the ‘ structor’ are
those the host is here represented as per-
forming. ¹It was his province to arrange
the dishes and see that they were properly
served up. He runs about, puts one course
after another on the table (¹ continuatque
dapes ’), and tastes the dishes to see if they
are properly seasoned. ‘ Praegustatores '
were regulme employed only at the tables
of the emperorS. Halotus, an eunuch, is
mentioned as serving the emperor Claudius
in this capacity and as having been, accord-
ing to some reports, the agent of his death.
(Sueton. Claud. 443 Tac. Ann. xii. 66.)
Lipsius on the latter place says, that the
practice was begun by Augustus, and the
title ‘ praegustator, a potione.' occurs in
inscriptions. The custom was imitated
from E)astern courts. (See Xenoph. Cyrop.
i. 8. 9.

coming in early to clean the room interi-apt,
the banquetters and ronse the vach-degn,
whose barking terrifice them stin further.
The distinction between ⁴ valvae ’ aad
‘fores,' that the latter opened natvm-dn,
⁴ foras‚’ and the others inwards, has been
disproved by Becker (Gau. Sc. ii. Ex. 1).
There was a dog, or more than one, kept in
most houses, in the ‘cella ostiari& the
porter’s chamber at the side of the ¹ ostium!
At the entrance of the house at Pompeii,
which has received the name of the Tragic
Poet’s House, there was discovered worked
in mosaic on the pavement a large dog,
black and white, with a red collar, with
fierce aspect, and as ir ready to spring upon
the person who entered. Beneath it are
the words “Cave Canem? Such dogs
were oooesionany painted 011 the. wall, as
Petronius relates. ‘Conclave' is the ge·
nei-al term for any chamber or mite of
chambers under one look or bolt. Aa to
Molossis see Epod. vi. 5.

the Greek σωρίτης (from σωρός, ‘,’acervus
a heap), a lovcal term signifying a series of
propositionis linked together and depending
each upon the one before it, till a conclusion
is come to which connects the first proposi·-
tion with the last3 but it may go on sor
ever without any conclusion st all. Persius
uses the same illustration (S. vi. 78, sqq-2)

“Rem duplica. Feci. Jam triplex; jam
mihi ‹Nuarto
’ Jam decies redit ιιι rugam. Depunge ubi
Inventus, Chrysippe, tui finitor aoervi.''

The invention of the σωρίτης is attributed
to Chrysippus the Stoic.

48. Qui redit in sartos] ΤΙιο word
¹ {antif as applied to records, belonged pro-
perly to the sacred books or tables in which
the ‘ fasti’ and ‘nefasti dies' were distin-
guished, that is, the Calendar. When thaee
ἀθ made public (Livy ix. 46) calendars
became common, and in those (which were
usually engraved on tables of stone) re-
markable events were inserted, so that they
became a source of historical information.
There werealso consular annals, or registers
of the consuls and other chief magistrates,
kept among the records of the state, and
these were also called ἰἐιειτὶ,1 or ‘annales’
either of which words came, in consequence,
to be used generally for historical registers
. of any kind, particularly by the poets.
Horace applies it to the family genealogies
of the Lamiafamily. (C. iii. 17. 4.) See
also C. iv. 13. 15 ; 14. 43 and S. i. 3. 112,
where it is applied in the most general way
to the history of the world.

49. Libitina] See S. ii. 6. 19, ιι.

50. Ennius et sapiens] Ennius was born
at Rudiae, in Calabria, 13.c. 239. Besidae
his great historical epic poem called Annales,
and plays, and satires, he wrote philosophical
{1233ss ”hisssstsshfiassiffffoe‘ffpffle‘ssff ’ἓξ
followed the opinions of Pythagoras, and in

the beginning os his epic poem he declared
that the spirit of Homer had passed into his
body, having meanwhile inhabited, among
others, that of a
says (vi. lo):

“Cor jubet hoc Enni, postqum destertuit

k ς whence Persius

esse

Maeonides, Quintus pavone ex Pytha·

gora, ἶ),

which means that he had woke up fi’om his
dream of being Homer, and, having passed
through the body of a peacock, he had be-
come Quintus Ennius. This is what Horace
alludes to in ‘ somnia Pythagorea.' He says

however that Ennius need not mind what ”

was thought of his professions and his
dreams, since he was certainly worshipped
as if he were a second Homer. As to
‘critici’ see Epp. 19. 40, ιι. Ennius is
called ⁴ fortis ' not for his personal bravery
(though he saw some service), but for the
boldness of his style.

53. Naevius in manibus non est] Cn.
Naevius was born about the middle of the
third century n.c., and wrote plays and au
epic poem on the first Punic war in which
he served (Gen. xvii. 21). To the latter
poem Virgil seems to have owed some of
his ideas. Terence ranks him with Plautus
and Ennius as one of his models; and,
comparing these three with his own con-
temporarios, he says:

“Quorum aemulari exoptem negligentiam
Potius quam istorum obscuram
tiam-’' (Prol- Andria, 20, sq.)

Naevius was perhaps rather the oldest of
the three.

54. Paene recens ?] , Bentley was the
first to make this sentence interrogative.
A few editors have declined to follow him
(Fen, Doering, and others); but 1 think he
is right. I can make no sense of the words
otherwise. Cicero very osten has ‘non est'
in interrogative sentences. ⁸ Paene recens'
means ‘ as if he were almost modern!

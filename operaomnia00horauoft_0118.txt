88 HORATII FLAOGI

Insigne maestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti, Pollio, curiae,
Oui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.
J am nunc minaci murmure cornuum
Perstringis aures, jani litui strepunt, Α
J am fulgor armorum fugaces
Terret equos equitumque voltus:
Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,
Et cuncta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.
J uno et deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impotens
Tellure victorum nepotes
Rettulit inferias J ugurthae.
Quis non Latino sanguine pinguior
Campus sepulcris impia proelia
Testatur auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinae?

10. mooe ubi publicas Res ordinaris]
‘ When you shall have finished your history
of public events! Thus Bentley also takes
it, saying the Greeks used συντάσσειν for
writing a book. Plutarch uses σύνταγμα
for a book. Ἀνατάξασθαι occurs in the
prefaoe to St. Luke’s Gospel, and is thus
rendered in the Vulgate translation, “ Quo-
niam quidem multi conati sunt ordinare
narrationem '' (quoted by Orelli). The
Scholiast Acron says that Pollio was writing
tragedy at the same time with his history,
and that the style of the one affected the
style of the other: so that Horace advises
him to lay aside his tragedies in order that
he may do justice to his history. As the
theme is delicate and he is well able to
adorn it, he should put aside the only
obstacle to its proper accomplishment, viz.
his tragedies. They were probably of no
great merit. None have survived, and he
has no credit for them, except with Horace
and Virgil, who were under personal obli-
gations tohim. See S. i. 10. 42, and Virg.

23. cuncta terrarum subacta] ¹ It is
probable that Pollio had given a very sfir-
ring account of Caesar’s African campaign,
in which he himself served, and that his
description had made a goeat impression

as being more appropriate to ‘ cuncta terra-
rum.’ But Horace is plainly referring to
what he had heard Pollio read. The MSS.
all have ‘ audire.’

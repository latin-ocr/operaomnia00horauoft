HORATII FLAOOI

Libris et curis, statua taciturnius exit
Plerumque et risu populum quatit; hic ego rerum

Fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis

Verba lyrae motura sonum connectere digner?
Frater erat Romae consulti rhetor, ut alter
Alterius sermone meros audiret honores,
Gracchus ut hic illi, foret huic ut Mucius ille,

Qui minus argutos vexat furor iste poetas?

Carmina compon0‚ hic elegos.

Gaelatumque novem Musis opus !''

Quanto cum fastu, quanto molimine circum-
Spectemus vacuam Romanis vatibus aedem !

Mox etiam, si forte vacas, sequere et procul audi,

87. Frater erat Romae] Who these
brothers were Horace does not tell 115, and
it does not matter. One a jurisconsultus
(see S. i. 1. 9, n.) and the other a teacher
of rhetoric. The lawyer said the rhetorician
was a perfect Gracchus for eloquence‚ and
he returned the compliment by declaring
that his brother was a second Scaevola for
legal learning. And this sort of mutual
flattery goes 011 Horace says among poets,
and he oennot keep pace with their passion
for praise. Tiberius Gracchus and his
brother Caius, were both in Cicero's opinion
great orators. We need not therefore at-
tempt to decide which Horace means us to
understand here. Q. Mucius Scaevola the
augur, son-in-law of C. Laelius, and an
early instructor of Cicero (Lael. c. l), was
learned in· the law; but his namesake
and younger contemporary, the Pontifex
Maximus, was more celebrated still. Cicero
(de Orat. i. 39) calls him ‘⁴ homo omnium
et disciplina juris civilis eruditissimus et
ingenio prudentiaque acutissimus, et ora-
tione maxime limatus atque subtilis, atque
ut ego soleo dicere juris peritorum eloquen-
tissimus eloquentium juris peritissimus.”
This name therefore like that of Gracchus
for oratory, stands for a consummate
’ux-ist. .

J 88. meroe audiret honoree‚] Compare
(Epp. i. 7. 84) ‘⁴ vineta crepat mera.''

89. foret huic ut Mucius illa] There
does not appear to be any extant MS. with
this reading. Fea mentions two editions of
1516 and 1520, by Giovanni Britannico
which have it. Lambinus has it, and says
nothing of the other reading (‘ foret hic ut

Mucius illi '), “quem tamen vel duo vel
nemo-secutus est ” (Bentley); “immo ita
igggiiiibi-ibuff (Cunningham Animadv. p.
77). But I cannot discover that any edi-
tions have it between Lambinus and Bent-

ley. “ Since Bentley nearly all editors have ·

‘huic ut Mucius ille! This is probably the

true reading: at least the other is uncouth ·”

and unusual ι but how this should have got

into all the known MSS„ and nearly every ’

edition, 1 do not understand.
90. arqutos] Compare iv. 6. 25: “Doc- ’

tor argutae fidicen Thaliae-’³ ⁷ It' means J
melodicus, and is a sort of mock compliment. “ ·
92. Caelatumque novem Musis opus] It ·
is likened to a perfect piece of carved work ἰ
111 which all the Muses hadahand. Bentley ἰ

has invented ⁴ sacratum!
93. quanto molimine]
the pompous strut with which they

granted a place is reserved'for them. ΔΙ ¹

distance, great or small. Here ‚it meniu

hard by, as in S. ii. 6. 1053 Epp- i. 7. -Ῑζ
‘ Quid ferat ' means what each has to say. ’ ”

97. caedimur et totidem plaqie] They Ρ

carry on such a contest of mutual flattery, —

that they are like two gladiators, each tryin'
to get the better of the other. ⁴ Samnites ’-
were a particular class of gladiatura, ω ’-

called because they wore the same arms a· ’ i

that people, particularly an oblong shield. ’ἓ

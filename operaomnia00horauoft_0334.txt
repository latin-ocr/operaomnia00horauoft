304 . HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN XIII.

This ode is like the ninth of the first book,-—a convivial song written in winter. A
political allusion is extracted from v. 7 as from v. 9 of the other ode, and in either case
we may suppose it possible that the troubles of the times are included in those anxieties
which were to be left to the gods. But this proves nothing as to time, except that they
were both written before the close of the civil wars, which is certain as respects this ode,
and very probable as to the other. There can be little doubt of the subject as well ns the
metre being imitated from the Greek. The reference to Achilles reminds us of C. i. 7,

and the allusion to Teucer. There is a fragment of Anacreon (6 Bergk) which bears
some likeness to the opening of this Epode :—

μεῖς μὲν δή Ποσιὸηἳὼν
ἕστηκεν νεφέλη δ’ ὕδωρ
* * * βαρὺ δ’ ἄγριοι
χειμῶνες παταγεῦσιν.

ARGUMENT.

The tempest is raging, let us make merry, my friends, while we are young,v and leave the
rest to the gods who will give us a good turn yet. Bring ointment and music, ns
Chiron taught his great pupil, saying, “ To Troy thou must go and not return; while
there drown care in wine and song, which are grief's pleasant comforters.¹ ¹

HORRIDA tempestas caelum contraxit et imbres
Nivesque deducunt J ovem; nunc mare, nunc siluae

Threicio Aquilone sonant: rapiamus, amici,
Occasionem de die, dumque virent genua

l. contraxit] This word is only to be
explained by observing the different aspect
of the sky when it is closed in with clouds,
and when it is spread out in all its breadth
and cloudless. A frowning sky is a notion
easily understood, and common to all lan-
guages.

3. rapiamus, amici, Occasionem de die,]
This is explained by C. iii. 8. 27· “Dona
praesentis cape laetus horae. '¹ ‘Die' means
the present day as opposed to to- morrow,
not, as some take it, ‘from this stormy day)
Bentley proposes‘ amice’ for‘ amici' be-
cause of v. 63 but‘ tu’ refers to the sym-

posiarch. Fen, following cruminis, sup-
poses the ode to be addressed to one person,

and the stoi-m to be a figurative way of ex-

pressing the state of public affairs, which' is
absurd. He and some others make‘ amici'

the nominative case.

4. dumque virent yenua] See C. i. 9,
17, ιι. The commentators quote Pliny (N.
H. xi. 45):⁴
dam religio observatione gentium· haec
{uppliffltes attingant, a? hzz-ep'tganus ὺριιᾷιιιιξίς

aecu arasaoran3 ο 88 umine
iis vitalitas.'' But these last ποι-(115 have no
meaning. What vitality is there in the
knees more than in any other part? The
strength of an active man lies very much in
his legs, and so they are put for his strength,
as in the 147th Psalm (v. 10· “Η8 de-
lig hteth not in the strength o the horse'i
he taketh not pleasure m the legs of a man·
and the knees are a chief part of the 1838,

HORATII FLAGGI

Ut versus facerem: sed quod non desit habentem
Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,
Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus?

Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum;
Tendunt extorquere poemata; quid faciam vis?
Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque:
Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis,

Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro.

Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur,
Poscentes vario multum diversa palato.

Quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu quod jubet alter;
Quod petis id sane est invisum acidumque duobus.

there is no knowing what poverty may have
led him to accept for severe personal satires,
of which there are specimens in the Epodes,
showing what he could do in that way. I
have no doubt 110 suppressed much of his
early poetry.

53. Quae poterunt unquam] The ‘ci-
cutax κωνεῖον, hemlock, was used as an
antifebrile medicine (see Pliny, xxiii. 13.
95). Horace asks what amount of ‘ cicuta’
would be sufficient to cool his veins if be
were so feverishly bent upon writing, as to
(10 30 when he could live without it.
Persius employs the same idea (v. 144) :

⁴⁴ Quidtibi vis? Calido sub pectore mascula
Iniziildnsuit³ quam non exstinxerit urna ci-
cutae.

60. Ille Bioneis sermonibus] Bion was
born on the Borysthenes, and was hence
called Borysthenites. He flourished about
the middle of the third century R.c. He
studied philosophy at Athens, and aster
passing through various sects, he became
at last a Peripatetic. Acron says of him
in his note on this place: “ Sunt autem dis-
putationes Bionis philosophi, quibus stul-
titiam arguit vulgi, cui paene consentiunt
carmina Luciliana. Hic autem Bion, qui
Sophistes cognominatus est, in libro quem
edidit, mordacissimis salibus ea quae apud
poetas sunt, ita laceravit, ut ne Homero
quidem parceret.’' Some of his sayings are

preserved 111 Diog.1aert.(iv.47,sqq.),
Cicero (Tusc. Quaest. iii. 26), and Senem

(deTranq. An. viii.;2 xv. 3· deBenef. ’-

As‘ sal’ is put for wit (S. i. 10. 3), ‘sale
nigro' means ooarse wit, of which the

ssourished during the latter half ofthefourth
inc. at the court of Philip, and in
the camp of Alexander. This story—»that
Alexander would not suffer himself to be
painted by any but Apelles—is referred to
by cicaro in his letter to Lucceius (sd Fam.
v. 12)= “ Neque enim Alexander ille grs-
τίω causa ab Apelle potissimum pingi et a
Lysippo fingi volebat3 sed quod illorum
ntem cum ipsis mm etism sibi gloriae fore
putabat? See also Pliny (vii. 38) and
Plutarch (Alex-e. 4). His merits are de—
scribed in the warmoet tei-ms by Pliny, und
his rspuhfiou as apainter stood higher than
any other of antiquity. His most cele-
Μ painfing was that of Aphrodite
rising fimn the sea, which existed in the
flmeof Augustus, and was placed by him
in the temple of Julius Cam.

Lysippus was a younger contemporary of
Apelleffiandanativezf Sicyon. lge wrouffiit
almost entirely ιιι ronze, an was e
author of the statue from which the Farnese
Her-mles was copied by Glycon. He made
several statues of Alexander, whom he ap-
pears like Apelles to have followed into
Asia. Plutarch (de Fort. et virt. Alex. ii.
2) says ἦν δὲ καὶ Ἀπελλῆς ὁ ζωγράφος
καὶ Λύσιππος ὁ πλάστης κατ’ Ἀλέξαν-
opav- ὧν ὁ μὲν ἔγραψε τὸν κεραυνόφορον
οὕτως ἕνα γεῖος καὶ κεκραμένως ὥστε
λέγειν, ὅτι υοῑν ’Δλεξάνδρων ὁ μὲν Φι

And he goes on to say that Alexander
ordered that Lysippus alone should make
his statues, because hewas the onlyartist
who represented his character, and while
sdhffling to his fautum did not fail tobi-ing
out bis virtues. The rest imitated his
peculiar- bend of the neck, and τῶν ὀμμά-

των τὴν διάχυσιν καὶ ὑγρότητα (which γ

means 1 suppose an extraordinary bright-
ness and rapid glancing of the eyes), but
did not present his manly and lion-like
aspect (τὸ ἀρῤενυπὸν καὶ λεοντῦδες), ἰιι
which therefore Lysippus may be supposed
to bave been successful.

244. Boeotum in crasso] Respecting
the proverbial dulness and sensuality of the
Boeotiam, which Polybius said was un·
paralleled in Grecian history, see Thirlwall
(Hist. Greece, i. 13), who attributes it, not
to ‘⁴ the dampness and thickness of their
atmosphere,” bnt to ‘⁴ the profusiou with
which the ordinsry gists of nature were
spread over the face of Boeotia, the abun-
dant returns of its grain, the richneoe of its
pastures, the mterials of luxury fumished
by its woods and wsters.” It is always
hard ω fix the causes of national character,
especially aster the lapse of centuria, and
they are probably too much limited iu this
account of the Boeotians.

245. tua de ee judicia atque Menam]
Respecting Vis-gil and Varius, and the pre-
sente they are said to heve received from
Augustus, see S. i. 5. 40, ιι.

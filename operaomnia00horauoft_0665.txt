Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.
Bnmdisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum,
Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,
Aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,

Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam,

Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis, uti mox
Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.
Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum, licet illi plurima. manet

’ Lacrima, per sanctum juratus dicat Osirim ε

¹ 52. Brundisium comen aut Surrentum]
To Brundisium a mm mig ht go on busi-
neem to Surrentum (Sor-rento) for the climate
and scenery, which are stin very healthy and
beautiful. Surrentum was made a Roman
colony about this time. We do not hear
much ot· it as a place of resort, though from
this passage we may infer that it was one of
the pleasant spots on the Campauian coast
to which the wealthy Romans went for
change of air. Its winae were celebrated
(see Epp. 15. 16, ιι.). Ιιι mentioniug

Brundisium, Horace may have been think·
ing of his Journey with Maecenas.

But other meanings have been given (sec
Dict. Ant.). ‘Nota acumina' means ⁸ the
hackneyed tricks!

59. Raeto mre plantum] The Romans
adopted the Greek word πλάνος for a
vagabond and impostor ( see Forcell. ).
Acron says it was the name of an impostor
who roeorted to this trick in order to get a
ride. As to ‘plurim' see C. i. 7. 8, ιι.
Horace makes the man swear by the Egyp-
tianosiris,as if thatwcrethemostsacred
of oaths. Among other new superstitious
the worship os Isis had been lately intro·
duoed into Rome. Efforts were made from
time to time to put it down, and Augustus
forbade its being exercised in the city. But
under later emperors it beccum established
with the encouragement of the gomi-ament,

in coujunction with that of Serapis. Osiris “

was not worshipped separately, but shared
perhaps the rever-enee paid to his wife.

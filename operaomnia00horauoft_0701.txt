154. Deteribh] This is used in the
nme sense iu S. ἰ. 4. 3: “Si quis erat

dignus describi.” ⁴ Fustuarium ¹ was amode
ol putting to death by beating with sticks
and ming, usually but not only, as the
passage shows, inflicted on soldiers. (See

and Livy makes Cato say, speaking in favour
of tholam Oppia (xxxiv. 4):‘ ‘Haec ego, quo
melior laetiorque' ιιι dies fortuna reipublicae

crede, si qm ab Syracusis illata sunt huic
urbi. Jam nimis multos audio Corinthi et
Athemrum ornamenta laudantes mirantes-
que, et antefixa fictilia eorum Romanorum
ridentes? Compare also what Livy says
(xxv. ⁴0) respecting the spoils imported by
Marcellus from Syracuse, which city was
taken a.u.c. 542, the seventh year of the
second Punic war, aster which Horace dates
the study of Grecian literature at Rome.
In A.u.c. 608, the last year of the third
Panic war, Corinth ww taken by Mummius,
and Seuthem Greece was formed into the
Roman province of Achaia. Horace had
probably both thoee periods in his mind, as
well as the conquest of southern Italy,' ιιι
the towns of which were some of the finest
works of Grecian art. Gellius (xvii. 21)
quotes two trochaic verses of Porcius Lici-
nius, a poet whose age is unknown:

“Poenico bello secundo Musa pinnato

gradu

Intplit senbellieosam iu Romuli gentem
enm.

The render will do well to refer to Spence s
Polymetis (pp. 36, sqq. sol. edit.) for an
accountof the progressos the Romans in
the appreciation of Greek literature and
arm. Arcferencetothe noteonv.ss-2wi11

158. Bestia-ie numer-m Saturnius] The
Saturnian verse, according to Niebuhr (i.
259, u.), continued in use down to the
middle of the seventh century of the city.
It consisted of a great variety of lyrical
metm, whichhe sayswereearriedtoa
high degree of perfectiori (but see his speci-
meus below). According to this it survived ’
Lucilius, and was not extinct when Cicero
was borh. Horace says traoea of the old
rudenoes remained iu his day, probably in
the less polished ‘ mimes,’ and in the ‘Fes-
cennina earmina,’ which were not extinct.
Niebuhr quotes the “ lex horrendi carminis.’'
given in Livy (i. 26) as a specimen of this
meoeure:
‘⁴ Dm‘unviri perduelli6nem jfidioent

Si a duumviris provocavit,

Provocfitffine certato ε

Si vincent caput obnubito:

Infelici arbore reste suspendito:

verberato intra vel extra pomoerium?
1 have given the verses according to Nie-
buhr's arrangement and accentuation, but
they appear to be quite arbitrary, and afford
no trace of rhythm. It was with reference
to the Saturnian verses that Ennius said:

“ Scripsere alii rem
Ὺετείὲιῐιε quos olim Fauni vatesque cane-
ant, '
Quum neque Musarum vscopulos quisquam
superarat.

Nec dicti studiosus eratl’

This verse, Niebuhr says (ii. 592, ιι.,) was
always used ιιι inscriptions3 as that' ιιι which
T. Quinctius, the dictator, recorded his cap

tureos nine towns, Α. u. c. 375 (Iivyvi. 29)),

the earliest inscription on record. It has
been thus restored:

CARMEN H.

A.U.c. 730.

Ποῖ-σο, meaning to write an ode on the moderate desire and use of weaIth, dedicated it
to C. Sallustius Crispus, grand- nephew of the histor-iau and inheritor of his property. He
hulmvioualyalludedtohiminnotermsofpraiseinSati. 2. 48; butthat Satire was
written many years before this ode, and at this time Sallustius m in high favour with
Augustus and possessed of great riches, of which Horace implies that he made a good use.
From the reference to Phraates’ retum to his throne (v. 17), which took place ΛΑΜ). 729
(aee C. i. 26, Introduction), the ode must have been written aster that event. Proculeius
mentioned in v. 5 was brother or cousin (it is not certain which) to Licinius Murena,
who mmo. 732 was detected in a conspiracy with one Fannius Caepio to take away the
life of Augustus (see C. ii. 10, Introduction). Ι cannot infer so positively as quke and
others do that Horace would have abstained from mentioning the generosity of Proculeius,
if his relation's «xime had been committed when he wrote; but that chronolog-ist takes

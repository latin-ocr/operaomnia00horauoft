SATIRARUM 1. 6.

Nec quod avus tibi maternus fuit atque paternus
Olim qui magnis legionibus imperitarent,
Ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco 5
Ignotos, ut me libertino patre natum. ·
Cum referre negas quali sit quisque parente
Natus dum ingenuus, persuades hoc tibi vere,
· Ante potestatem Tulli atque ignobile regnum

Multos saepe viros nullis majoribus ortos

of the verb, some having the perfect indim-
tive ‘imperitarunt,' others the perfect eub-
junctive ‘imperitarintss But the imperfect
aeeme to be required, and Bentley says that
that tense, rather than the perfect, always
does follow ‘fuit qni,' os below, Epp. ii. 2.
128, sqq. In prose there can be no doubt
the subjunctive would be required here (see
Key'a 1.. G. 1189), and the imperfect is
required by the sense, which dooe not mean
to limit the statement to one of Maecenas'

ancestors, but to a suctiaeSion of them. It
seems fiom inscriptions to have been the
practice of the Etrurians for men to be dis·

tinguished by the name of thm'r mother as
well as their father.

5. nm rumpendi: adunco] This the
Greeks expwed by μυκτηρίζειν. To say
that it is a metaphor taken from the sage-
city of the dog, as Forcellini dom, is a
misuka, for it ie obviously taken from that
inrtinctive motion of the features which ex-
prenae· contempt. How to account for it
may not be easy, though it is so common.

had given him his freedom. Orelli (on
v. 40 of this Satire) retains the notion that

‘libertinus ' means the son of a ‘lihertuass
a meaning which, if it ever existed, did not
belong to the word in Horaoe’a time. He
expreenly says his father was a ⁴ libertinus!
If so, he must have been ‘ingenuus,' ac-
cording to this definition ; but he was not.
(See Dict. Ant„ art. ‘ libertae') Tine son
of a ‘libertinus’ born after his futher's
manumission, and all other persons born
free, were ‘ingenui ;' and Horace says that
Maecenati, though he would not take into
his intimacy a freedman, made no enquiry

asto the parentage of any one born fiee,
but would make him his friend if he de·
served it. Acron interprets‘ ingenuus' aa

“ad moris probitatem And
some editors (Gesner among them) have
followed him. Ι do not agree with them.

9. Ante potestatem Tulli] Horace here
follows the legend which made Servius
Tullius the son of a slave-girl, and himself
a slave in the palace of King'rarquinius.
On this account‘his reign was iguobb,
while in true nobility it was sun-passed by

ncne of the others. Another legend (which -

Ovid follows, Fast. vi. 627, sqq.) make
Tullius the son of Vulcau, but his motha· ia
there also a slave, having been taken oeptiv ve
ot Corniculum, a city taken by Tarquiniua

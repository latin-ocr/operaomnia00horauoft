576 HORATII FLAGGI

EPISTLE VI.

Who Numicius was nobody can tell, and it does not signify. Any other name would
have done as well. Nothing turns upon the character or circumstances of the person
nominally addressed, and 1 feel inclined to put the Epistle in the same light as several of
the Odes, in which, as Ι have often had occasion to remark, a name seems to be intro-
duced more to give life to the poem than for any other reason. The Numidam a
patrician gens of no great note.

In respect to the time of composition, the only guideis v. 26: “Cum bene notum,

Porticus Agrippae et via te conspexerit Appi,'’ and that does not aesist us much. (See
note.) .
As to the design of the Epistle, it is to support virtue, under the aspect of a calm self-
oontent as the chief good. The ordinary standards of happiness are treated with oon-
tempt, and there is a strong vein of irony running through the greater part of the Epistle,
as will be seen by the Argument.

ARGUMENT.

Τὴθ only way to get happiness and to keep it, Numicius, is ω keep the mind from ex·
citement. There are wise men who can lookccalmly on the awful skies. Whatdo
you suppose they think of the treasures of the earth and sea, and the rewards of ι
paltry ambition ? But he who fears their opposites is excited just as much as he who
desires these things themselves: each is taken by surprise, and in either case there is
uneasiness. Be it joy or grief, desire or fear, what is the differenoe if every thing that
falls out a little otherwise than is expected strikes a man dumb and makes him stam
like an idiot? Nay, he who seeks virtue herself in excess is mad though he be wise,
and a knave though he be good.

(v. 17.) Now then, go run after fine things, delight yourself in the praises of a nolu
rise early and sleep late, that that low Mutus may not be richer aud therefore more
admired than you; but be sure that time brings obscurity to light and buries all that
is brilliant in the earth: aster all your admiration you shall go whither greater men
have gone before you.

(v. 28.) If you are sick you take physic. You want to be happy of course. Then it
virtue be the only means, be resolute, make every sacrifice, and follow her.

(v. 31.) If virtue be but a name, make haste to be rich: off with you before any oue
gets the start: money is a queen, she will get you every thing. Persuasion aud Low
are in her train. Mind you are not like the poor king of Cappadocia. No', look at
Lucullus, who knew not how much he had got: that is your only rich man: he had
plenty for himself and the thieves too. So if money* is to make you happy, make that
your first object and your last.

(v. 49.) But if you are for honours and show, why then get yourself a man to prompt
you ε “ here comes so·and-so—-shake hands with him—there’s a man will get you
plenty of votes—here’s another can give pisces to whom he will.'' Be sure you are
civil to them: make them father, brother, on the spot.

(v. 56.) And if eating is your good, see, the day dawns, be off to the market, buy your
boar as Gargilius did, aud pretended he had killed it himself. Let us go bathe with.
our bellies full—no more fit to be citizens of Rome than the swinish crew of Ulysses.

SATIRARUM Ι. 6.

399

Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare docendum
Artes quas doceat quivis eques atque senator
Semet prognatos. Vestem servosque sequentes,
,In magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita

- Maiore quisquam circulo coronetur.
Alboe Leone flammeo mlent luces
Tostamque fervens Julius coquit messem.
Cirrata loris horridis Scythae pellis
Qua vapulavit Marsyas Celaenaus,
Ferulaeque tristes sceptra paedagogorum
Cessent et Idus dormiant in Octobres.
Aestate pueri si valent satis discunt.”

hom this it is inferred that it was an
exception to the rule if schools were not
closed during the summer months. That
these months were four is not stated 1)]
Martial, and for an uninterrupted vacation
any body will see that it is excessive. There
aro commentatos-s (Torrentius, Zeuni, and
others), who suppooe that ⁸ referentes aera'
means not bringing with them their school-
fee, but calculating, according to exercises
given them 1)] the master, sums of interest
(which tbe Romans paid on the Ides).
‘Referentes' they suppose to be entering
in theoct-blec. Torrentius also affirms that
flio sehoolmaster’s stipend was paid him
annually, because Juvenal says (vii. 242, sq.) :

“Haeo, inquit, cures et cum se verterit
Ammpxenusviaeori populus quod postulat,
aurum]

But the practice may have varied even in
Horaoe' s fime, and still more between
Horaoe's and Juvenal's.1n the absence
of any decided authority (Martial' s is vague)
as to any specifie practice about holiday s
or day of payment, 1 am inclined to think
‘octonis Idibus' must be merelya peri-
phrasis for ‘Idibus’ ‘'Aera is used by
Juvenal for the teaoher's fee (“ Minus est
autem quam rhetoris aera, ”) and in that
sense Ι take it, not with Torrentius. To
mume from Juvenal (x. 117, quoted in last
note) that the regular payment at one of
these cheap schoolswas ιιιι as, ’andthat
‘'aera is equivalent to ‘lassos is un-
warranted. The‘ as 'there referred to was
the MinervaL a voluntary offering presented
by each scholar to his master at the Quin-
quau-ia, the festival of Minerva. The terms
no doubt varied, though they must have
been low at this Venusian school, and at all,
compared with those of modern days.
76. Sed pueram est aum] At what
age Horace was seut to Rome he does not

inform us. But it is probable he went when
he was twelve years old.

77. Artes quas doceat] In the earlier
day s of Roman history the education of a
boy was of the simplest kind, consisting
chiefly of reading, writing, and arithmetie.

‘'calculator and‘ notarius' continued un-
til the time of Martial to be names for
a schoolmasterz and, as observed before
(v. 72, n.,) the majority of boys loernt
little more than the above even in Horaoe’ s
time. When (“ icero was a boy the learning
of the twelve tables formed a necessary part
of education (Leg. ii. 23)· “Discebamus
enim pueri duodecim ut carmen necessarium,
quas) jam nemo discitl' Freer intercourse
with Greece. and the Greek towns of Italy
brought a more liberal class ot studies to
Rome, where Horace says he studied
Homer (Epp. ii. 2. 41, sq.) :—

“ Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.'’

Rhetorie was a branch of study much
pursued by the young Romans; poetry
likewise‚ and the philosophy of Greece.
Their studies commenced at an early age,
at first under the teaching of their‘ paeda-
gogi, 'and afterwards (till they assumed the

‘toga virilis,' andin some oeses longer) at
tliega ‘ludi literarii,¹ private schools which
they attended as day scholas-s. The‘ paeda-
gogus,’ whose office was of late growth at
Rome and borrowed from Greece, had the
same functions as the παιδαγωγός among
the Greeks, and was a slave as there. He
was continually about the boy’s person, and
went with him to his masters. This task
Horaoe¹s father, who could have had but
few slaves, and had none whom he could
trust with such important duties, performed
himself. Besides the ‘paedagogum’ as ob.
served above (v. 74, ιι.), other slaves went
with the boyto carry his bag, δια, and to
give him consequence.

79. In mayno nt populm] The meaning
of this is variously given. ‘⁴ As is proper in
a great city like Rome,’' Dillenbr. says: ‘⁸ so
far as onecouldseeme in suehabusy
crowd,” is Orelli's interpretation and Hein-
dort's. Doering is divided between the two.
1 am not clear upon the point, but 1 incline
to Heindorf's opinion. On the construction,

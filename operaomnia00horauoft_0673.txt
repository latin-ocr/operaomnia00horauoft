Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos,

Num te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,
Num pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes;

Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane donet ;

Quid minuat curas, quid te tibi reddat amicum
Quid pure tranquillet, honos an dulce lucellum,
An secretum iter· et fallentis semita vitae.

Bentley hss‘ ne, 'which is the reading of
most of the editions of the sixteenth cen-
tury, md of several MSS. of Lambinus,
Cruquius, Fea, aud others. ‘ Non ’ is the
reading of Ven. 1483, and others of that
century3 but it has no meaning, and I
take it to be a corruption of ⁴ num! ‘ Ne'
1 imagine to be later than ⁴ non' (which
appears ιιι Porphyrion's commentary), and
a substitution for it, ιιι order to make sense
of the passage. ‘Num’ appears in all
Orelli’s and the Parisian MSS.

1⁰0. Virtutem doctrina μικτή] Whe-
ther virtue is a science ἐπιστήμη) aud
capable of being taught ( ιὸακτή) is dis-
mssed by Socratas in Plato’ s dialogue
Menon. Ηε held that virtue consists ιιι
thendenoeofgood; thattobevirtnouswe
must know what is good, for we must do
what is good becausewe know it to be
good, or there is no virtue in doing it. He
held that we have a moral sense by which
good is perceived, but the moral sense, like
other facultioe, requiras to be strengthened
and assisted by instruction, and to that ex-
tent virtue is διδακτή. Practically this ap-
pears to have been the doctrine of Socrates.
It is expressed in several placas in the
Memorabilia, as in l. ii. c. 6, ξ 39; ὅσαι
δ’ ἐν &epm-mg ἀρεται λέγονται, σκοπου-
μενος εὑρήσεις πάσας μαθήσει τε και με-
λέτῃ αὐξανομένας. Comp. iii. 9.1, aud
iv. 1. 3, sqq Antisthenes and the Cym 'cs
. held the same opinion, in the following out
of which Socrates himself was led into some
eontradictions. The question was a common
rhetorical theme in Horace's day: hence
Cicero mentions it with other kindred topics
in his treatise ⁴ De partitione Oratoriae,'
c. 18: ‘⁴ ubi quaeritur quemadmodum quid-
que fiat3 ut quonam pacto virtus pariatur,
naturane an ratione an usu. ”

103. fallentis semita vitae] See Epp.
17. 10,ιι., and compare Juvenal (x. 363).

104.9e12·dus Diqentia rivum] The Di-
geutia (Licenza) was a small stream which,

it. Dey Chaupy (iii. 156) says with refer-
ence to the epithet‘ gelidus? ‘⁴8ae eaux
tirent de leur origine une fraicheur qu 'elle
conservent dans une vallee aussi close, et.
que l'air plus libre qu 'elles trouvent apres
elle n ’est capable qne d’ augmenta-3¹ There
is a v called Bardela‚ which probably ,
stands on the site of Mandela. Itis at the
root of Monte cantalupo, at the head of
the valley of Licenza, and on the banks of
the stream which sep arates it from Vico
Varo (Varia, Epp.. 14. 3). Walckenaer
(Hist. p. 412) says it is about four and two·
thirds Roman miles west of Licenza, which
he identifies with Ustica (C. i. 1211).
De Chaupy places it about the same dis-
tance. He explains from his own observa-
tion how, through its position at the head
of the valley, and the winds that blow upon
it from the north-east, it was colder than
Horace' s raeidence higher up the valley, by
way of reconciling the description ‘ rugosus
frigore pagus ' with ⁴ temperiem laudes ’ in
Epp. 16. 8. Ηε gives a sepulchral inscrip-
tion, of date not earlier than the establish-
ment of Christianity, dug up ιιι the last

remains of his wife and daughter, (ιΝ
russeus surs massan ΜΑΝιιιιιΑΝΑιις
where De Chaupy says‘ massa' is equivalent
ω( pagus’ or hamlet. The word is found
in other sepulchral inscriptions, in some
of which it cannot bear that meaning, and
a different interpretation is given to it bv
Fabretta‘ (see Forcell. ). But the inscriptioh
sufficiently shows the site of Mandela. The
expression‘ rugosus frigore pagus’ may be
suggested by pictures and other representa-

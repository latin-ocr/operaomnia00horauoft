Me, libertino natum patre et in tenui re,

HORATII FLAOCI EPISTOLARUM Ι. 20.

μ20

Majores pennas nido extendisse loqueris,
Ut quantum generi demas virtutibus addas 3
Me primis Urbis belli placuisse domique ;
Corporis exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum, ‚

Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.

25

Forte meum si quis te percontabitur aevum,
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres
Collegam Lepidum quo duxit Lollius anno.

23. Me primis Urbis] This he considers
no small praise, as he says Epp. i. 17. 35,
‘¹ Principibus placuisse viris non ultima
laus est;” and S. ii. l. 75, “tamen me
Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque
Invidia.'' He does not mind at this time
referring to his old generals, Brutus and
Cassius. The description he gives of him-
self corresponds with that we find in his
biographer. See also Epp. i. 4. 15. C. ii.
11. 15. ‘Solibus aptum' means that he
liked warm weather. See ii. 3. 10, n.

28. Colleyam Lepidum] Horace was
born on the 8th December A.U.c. 689, in
the year of the consulship of L. Manlius
Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta. He com-
pleted his 44th year therefore in December
A.u.c. 733. In that year M. Lollius (to
whom C. iv. 9 is addressed) was elected one
of the consuls, and the other consulship was
offered to Augustus, who was in Sicily on his
way to Samos for his health. Augustus re-
fused it, and after a great deal of intrigue and

disturbance between Q. Aemilius Lepidus
and L. Silanus, who were summoned by Au-
gustus to answer to him for their conduct,
Lepidus was elected. Orelli thinks this
after-election is referred to in the word
‘duxit,' as if Lollius, being first in the
place, drew the other to him, which appears
to me rather far-fetched. Horace is not
likely to have spoken of him as the author
of his colleague’s election, whatever hand
he may have had in securing it. Why
Horace should be so particular in letting
the world know his present age in the above
year I cannot tell. He was in a eommuni-
cat-ive mood when he wrote, and tells us in
a few words a good deal about himself.
Porphyrion says, “ Annos quatuor et qua-
draginta dicit, et simul ostendit et quo mense
natus et quo anno aetatis suae hunc per-
scripserit.’' I do not see that any such in-
tention can be ascertained from the text.
But Franke agrees with the Scholiast (see
Introduction). ⁴

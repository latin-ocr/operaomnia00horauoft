HORATII' FLAGGI

Defixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?

Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,

Ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam.

I nunc, argentum et marmor vetus aeraque et artes
Suspice, cum gemmis Tyrios mirare colores;
Gaude quod spectant oculi te mille loquentem;

N avus mane forum et vespertinus pete tectum,

Ne plus frumenti dotalibus emetat agris

Mutus et, indignum quod sit, pejoribus ortus

Hic tibi sit potius quam tu mirabilis illi.
Quidquid sub terra est in apricum proferet aetas;

Defodiet condetque nitentia.

Porticus Agrippae et via te conspexerit Appi,

15. Insani sapiens] Whether ironically
or carried away by an unusual fit of en-
thusiasm, Horace maintains that a man
may seek virtue itself ⁴ ultra quam satis est.'
What he means, or should mean, is, that
excitement is to be avoided in the pursuit
of the chief good as well as of subordinate
goods. But, by saying that virtue itself
may be admired inordinately, he is able to
introduce with more contemptuous force
the vulgar objects of admiration that follow,
respecting which see C. iv. 8. 23 S. i. 4.
28; ii. 3. 1183 and other places in the

21. dotalibus emetat αρν-ὑπ] This is
equivalent to ⁸ metat ex agris dotalibus‚’ as
in-S. ii. 2. 1⁰5 he says ‘emetiris acervo.'
‘ Emeto' is not used elsewhere. Who is
meant by Mutus, if any body, is not known.
I do not think any one in particular is
alluded to. The name, though it occurs in
inscriptions, and therefore is a Roman name,
is perhaps adopted here by way of opposi-
tion to the eloquent man who by his own
exertions was running an unequal race with
the other man’s luck. According to most
medem commentators ⁴ indignum' is used
absolutely as an exclamation, and ⁴ quod sit
pejoribus ortus ¹ explains why it was a
shame. Mutus was a low fellow who had
got rich by a fortunate marriage, and it was
a shame that the orator should be obliged
to look up to him as he must because he
was rich. I am inclined rather w take
‘ indignum quod sit ' together, asTorrentius
does in his notes, though he edits ‘ Mucius
indignum.' which is the reading of some of
the old editions and of Lambinus, Cruquius,
and others. Bentley prefers ¹ qui sit: for
which there is no authority.

24. Quidquid mh term eet] Thin is

like Sophocles (Aj. 646)=

ἅπανθ’ ὁ μακρὸς κάναρίθμητος χρόνος
φύει τ’ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται.

‘ In apricum ' means ⁴ to the rays of the sun‚'
‘ to the light of day! Horace means by this
reflection that the man need not be in euch
a hurry to make himself a name, since time
would swallow it up, while it brought for-
ward the obscure.

26. Porticus Ayrippae] In A.u.c. 729
Agrippa built the Pantheon near the
Campus Martius, to which a ‘ porticus '
was attached. He also built in the same
{Q ffifoeffmeffinm ⁰322, '²5:²¹ ἒξ,

he gave the name Porum mmmm.
It was not far from the Via F'lamiuia, on
the site of the modern Pinna di Mu

(Nardini ap. Cramer). lt was dedicated to

Neptune, and contained a painfing of the

Argonauts. Mariial refer-sto it (iii. 20. m);

asking where his friend Canius Rufus is, he

says:

‘⁴ Hinc si recessit porticum terit templi, Ι
An spatia carpit lentus Argonautarum ἰ
An delicatae sole rursus Europae ”—

where ‘ templi ' probably refers ω the Pen-
theon. He refers to the second again (xi.
l); among several ⁴ porticus‚¹ those of
Quirinus, Pompeius, and Europa
“ Vicini pete porticum Quirini;

Turbam non habet otiosiorem

Pompeius, vel Agenoris puella,

Vel primae dominus levis carinae ;”

that is, Jason. Which of the two is re-
ferred to it is impossible to say. Esne

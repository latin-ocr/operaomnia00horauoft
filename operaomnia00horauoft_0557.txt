quoting as his authority Apion’s work on
Antiq uitias, is the earliest writer

who propagated the vulgar error that there
was a neu-ve communicating between the
fourth finger of the left handg and the heart,
and 11181 therefore rings were worn on that

mpartimlar, which absurdity (still
commonly believed) Sir Th0mas Browne
has very learnedly disposed of (Vulg. Errors,
iv. 4). Gellius says the ancient Greeks

These who were not entitled to wear rings of
gold had them of iron, according to the
most audent practice; and such of the
Romans of higher condition as adhered to
the simplicity of earlier days continued to
wear iron.

Nothing is known of Priscus. He was a
senator, and therefore entitled to go abroad
with the ‘latus clavus: which he would do
sometimes3 while at others he would
pear only asan ‘eques,' with the ⁴ angustus
davus! He was rich enough to live in a
fine house, aud did so; but would from
caprice go and take an obscure lodging,
such as a poor man might be ashamed of.

Athens as a philosopher. That seems to be
all. He was just such an unstable person

1118 was “every thing by turns and nothing
ong. '

14. Vertumnis. quotquot sunt, natus
iniquam] Vertumnus, as his name indi-
cates, was the god who represented change.
Horace says Priscus w„ born when Ver-
tumnuswas angry(see S. 3. 8, 8., “Iratis
natus paries dis atque poetis')‚ and he
strengthens it by saymg all the Vertumni

15. Scurra Volcania-cd Nothing is
known of this person. He had the gout,
which Horace says 118 richly deserved, and
was so given to gambling (whichwas illegal,
see C. iii. 24, 58, 8.), 11181 when he could
not handle the dice-box himself, he hired a
boytodo it for him. ‘Phimus' was the
Greek word for what the Romans called
‘fritillusx From the shape it was also
called ‘turricula’ or ‘pyrgus' (πύργος),
and that word appears in the text of the
Scholiasts and in many of the old editions
for ‘phimum.' As to ‘talos,’ see S. 3. 171,
were not always thrown from a
box, but sometimes with the hand.

19. levius miser ac prior ium] ‘ Levius
miser ' is an 8888881 expression. The MSS.
and editions vary between ‘illo ¹ and‘ ille!
Bentley and many others before and after
him have ‘ille.y ‘’Illo gives the simpla·
construction. ‘Prior illo' means better off
than that man who is always changing his
character, one moment appearing sti-iet,
another loose, in his principles and conduct.
The superiority of the man who is con-
sistent in vice lies in his indifference 10

arisingfromthat cause. In that sense-he

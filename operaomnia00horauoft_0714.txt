gl— super hoe] It is doubtful whether
this means ‘besides this,' as in S. ii. 6. 3,
“Et paulum silvae super his'' (see note),
or ‘about this,’ as 44 Pallescet super his ’'
(A. P. 429). Orelli takes it the former

36. Luculli miles collecta viatica] As
to Lucullus, see Epp. i. 6. 40, n. The
soldier of whom this story is told Por-
phyrion calls Valerianus Servilianus, and he
makes him an offioer of rank, ⁴ praefectus,’
perhaps one of those who had command
of the auxiliary troops, though the title
was not confined probably to these. (See
Caesar, B. G. i. 39, Long’s note.) The
office of ⁴ praefectus castrorum: which Orelli
supposes Porphyrion to mean, is not men·
tioned so early as Lucullus. Whatever
groundwork of truth there may be in it,
Horace has evidently altered the story to
suit his purpose. ‘Viatica’ would include
money as well as baggage and 4 kit ' as our
soldiers call it. Cicero uses the word meta-
phorically for money (Cat. Maj. c. 18):
44 Avaritia senilis quid sibi velit nou in-
telligo. Potest enim quidpiam esse ab·
surdius quam quo minus viae restat eo plus
viatici quaerere ?''

30. Praesidium reyale] This would be

a fortress in which Mithridates kept some*

part of his treasures.

33. his dena cuper sestertia] The ⁴ ses-
tertium ’ was a sum equal to about 81. 17⁸.
of our money, twenty of which (1661. 13⁸.
411.) would not be a large sum for an officer

40
of rank. But he must be supposed, from

his exploits, to have held some command. ν ’

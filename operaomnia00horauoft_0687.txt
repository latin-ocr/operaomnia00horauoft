when the question ofhis name was debated
some would have had him called Romulus
as the second founder of the city, but that
the judgment of Munatius Plancus prevailed
and he was called Augustus. Dion Cassius
(53,16) says he wanted very much to be
mlled Romulus, but was afraid people
would think he was aiming at being king,
and therefore took the name of Augustus.
Dion' s stories of this sort are not always to
be eumd, and this is no doubt untrue.
Augustushadtoo much sense to desire such
a name as Romulus. Τ115 four here named
wem the favourite heroes of the Greeks, who
attributed chiefly to their labours the civili-
ation of the world, and to their care its pre-
mation. The labours of Hercules are mued

ut duros mille labores
Rege sub Eurystheo, fatis ,Iunonis miquae,
Pertulerit.”

Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.”

In Qu. Curtius’ history of Alexander (viii.
18), the author, speaking of his flatterers,
says: “Hi tum caelum illi aperiebant3
Herculem et Patrem Liberum et cum Pol-
luce Cmtorem novo numini cessuros esse
jactabant ;'’ aud one of them named Cleo, 5
Sicilian: ‘¹ merita percensuit, quibus uno
modo referri grstia posset, si quem intellige-
rent Deum esse confiterentur. —Nec Her-
aulem quidem et Patrem Liberum prius

Horace or they had some book which they
mutually imitated.

means attainments of any kind, 1 suppose.

Suetonius says of Augustus.

“Templa

solere, in nulla tamen provincia nisi com-

muni suo Romanoque nomine recepit. Nam
in urbe quidem pertinacissime abstinuit

Among the coins represented in Patini' s
notes on Suetonius (Burmann' s edition) 15
one of silver, which he calls‘ ‘rarissimus
maximi moduli nummus, '' and on the re·
verse of which 15 5 temple with the inscrip-

735. (Compare the inscriptionwith Clinton’s
F. H. for that year.) From the words “cou.
Asl.'' (Communi Asiae) it may have been the
temple at Pergamum alluded to by Tiberius
in his speech to the senate when he declined
a similar honour offered to him in Spain.
(Tan. Ann- iv. 37.) It is also mentioned
by Dion Cass. (51. m), with one
in Nicomedia (Bithynia). See also Anu.

appears repeatedly from Cicero's letters,
from coins, und other sources, the governors
often enjoyed. Josephus mentions 5 tem ple
of great beauty built in honour of Rome
and Augustus by Herod the Great at Cae-

sarea, with 5 00105551 statue of Augustus as
large 55 that of the Olympiam Zeus aster
which it was modelled3 and another of Rome
like that of Here at Argos. This was built
of course during his life3 but Suetonius'

HORATII FLAOOI

Dicitur Afrani toga convenisse Menandro,
Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi,

cuvius was nephew to Ennius, and was born,
like his uncle, in Calabria, about 13.c. 220.
Quintilian (x. 1) says of him and Accius
that they were “ clarissimi gravitate senten-
tiarum, verborum pondere, et auctoritate
personarum. Ceterum nitor et summa in
in excolendis operibus manus magis videri
potest temporibus quam ipsis defuisse.
Viri'um tamen Accio plus tribuitur; Pacu-
vium videri doctiorem qui esse docti affec-
tant volunt.’' In his Dialogue de Oratoribus
he says that of an orator is required poetical
grace, “non Accii aut Pacuvii veterno in-
quinatus3 sed ex Horatii et Virgilii et
Lucani sacrario prolatus, ·’' and of Asinius
(Pollio) he says: “Pacuvium certe et Ac-
cium non solum tragoediis sed etiam orationi-
bus suis expressit, adeo durus et siccus est.¹¹
Cicero (Orat. c. 11) says that Pacuvius'
verses were “ ornati elaboratique‚'' though
elsewhere (Brutus 74) he says he and Cae-
cilius wrote bad Latin. Varro (ap. Gell. vii.
14) mentions him as an example of a rich
style (‘ ubertas ’). The chief compositions
of Pacuvius were tragedies, and they were
nearly all translated from the Greek. A
scene from his Orestes is referred to by
cicero (de Amicit. c. 7). Persius (i. 76)
mentions his Antiopa in no very flattering
terms:

ιἘείᾎιιιιιιο Briseis quem venosus liber
Sunt qud‘sel Pacuviusque et verrucosa more-
AntiopaTr aerumnis cor luctificabile fulta.''

But Cicero places him at the head of the
Roman tragedians: ‘⁴ Licet dicere et Ennium
summum epicum poetam si cui ita videtur,
et Pacuvium tragicum, et Caecilium fortasse
comicum ” (de Opt. Gen. Dic. i. 2).

In respect to Accius, see S. i. 10. 53, n.

As to ‘ senis ’ see S. ii. l. 34, n.

57. Dicitur Afrani toqa] Comedies
written after a Greek model, with Greek
scenes and characters, were called ¹ pal-
liatae3’ those of which the incidents and
persons were Roman were called ‘ togatae,’
from the dress of the actors, the Greek
⁴ pallium ' corresponding to the Roman
‘ toga! Afranius wrote principally ⁴ togatas‚’
and Horace says that, according to the
judgment of the critics‚ his toga would have
suited Menander; that is, that Menander
need not have been ashamed of his plays.
Quintilian says: “Togatis excellit Afranius.
utinamque non inquinasset argumenta pue-

rorum foedis amoribus, mores suos fassus '’
(x. l 100), which gives the character of the
plays and of their author. Cicero (de Fiu.
i. 3) says he borrowed from Menander.
He calls him elsewhere‘ ‘homo peu-argutus,
in fabulis quidem etiam disertus” (Brut.
c. 45). Suetonius (Nero c. ll) mentions a
‘ togatas of Astanius’, the title of which was
‘ Incendium,' but he *does not say what it
was about. Gellius quotes two lines from
another enfitled ‘Sella.' They give some
idea of the writer’s style and opinions: >

‘⁴ Usus me genuit. mater peperit Memoriaz
Soplhjglm vocant me Graii, vos Sapien-

Gellius also (x. ll) quotes from another
play of the same description, the name of
which, if the text is right, was 'fit-alus,
which Festus says is equivalent to ‘miles.’
Other fragments have been preserved in
Cicero and other writers. Afranius was
'slome years younger than Caecilius and
erence.

of Menander, who flourished at Athens ἢ

during the latter part. of the fourth century
n.c., mention has been made on S. i. 4. l.

Horace seems to have studied Menander. ’

(See S. ii. 3. ll,.n.)

58. Plautus ad exemplar Siculi prope-
rare Epic-harma] As to Horace's opinion
of Plautus, see below (170, sqq..) What
his critice meant when they said what Ho-
race here attributes to them I do not know,

· and, since we have no means of com

the writings of Plautus and Epicharmus, Ι
do not see how the question can be decided-
Epicharmus, a native of Cos, lived from
ac. 540 to the age of ninety. He went to
Sicily, according to the account of Diogenes
Laertius (viii. 78), at the age of three
months, while from statements of other
writers it is inferred that he was much
older. The chief part of his literary life
was spent at the court of Gelon, and his
successor Hiero at Syracuse, with Pindar,
Aeschylus and other poets who were pap
tronized at that court, where he composed
comedies, thirty-five of which are known
by their titles and some by fi-agments.

They are partly mythologioal and partly*
political and historical. He is cauea 1:5²1: ¹

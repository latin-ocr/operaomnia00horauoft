GARMINUM Ι. 2. 7

CARMEN II.
A.U.c. 725.

'nuisedewasprobahlywritten onthereturnofAugustusto Rome,afterthe
hung of Alexandria, when the civil ware were brought to a close and the temple
of Janus was shut, A.u.c. 725. Horace here expresses the opinion which Tacitus
(Ann. i. 9) states was held by reflecting men of all parties, “non aliud discordantis
pse-ise remedium fuisse quam ut ab uno κειμενα-αι’,η that the only remedy len: for the
mama of the state was an absolute government in the hands of one person. He has
bem &urged with deserting his republican principles, aud even urging the destruction of

those whose party he had once belonged to, and with whom he had fought et Philippi. ⁶

But norme urges reform, not bloodshed3 and he had lived long enough to see that reform
was not to be expected at the hands of republican leaders, or from any but him whose
genius was now in the ascendant. It is uot therefore in any mean spirit that he urges
upon Augu-tus to take upon himself the tssk of reducing to order the elements of the
m, which so many years of civil war had throwu into confusion. -Noue of Horace’ s
ndu are more justly celebrated than this for the imsgery it contains, for its genuine
feeling, and for the delioecy with which it flatters Augustus. investing him with divine
»mih-nabun invitinghim to exercise them as a father correcting and defending his
children, aud thus to avenge in the noblest manner his great-uncle's murder. The
way in which he introduces the name of Caesar unexpectedly at the end has always
a appeared to me an instance of consummate art.

The prodigies described at the beginning of this ode are those which were said to have
followed the death of Julius Caesar. They are related also by Virgil, Georg. i. 466-489,
which passage, and the verses that follow it to the end of the book, should be read in con· ’
uexion with this ode. It will appear to anyreader of both very probable that Horace had
this desciption in his mind when he wrote. It has been thought that Horace could not have
referred to prodigies which had occurred so long before (Amne. 710, fifteen years before
this ode was written), when he was at Athens, and therefore could not have witnessed
them. other prodigies therefore have been assumed as the subject of these opening
sunus. Buttheonly other occasions, about this time, when the Tiber is recorded to have
overflowed its banks, were Ass-c. 727 and 732, the earliest of which years would be too
late for this ode, in which the allusions to the state of Rome and the triumphs of
Augustus (v. 49), and the proposal that he should assume supreme authority, would in
that ease have been out of date and unnecessary. One of the chief purposes professed by
Augustus was the avenging of his adoptive futhei-’s death: see Suet. Octav. x.: ‘⁶ Nihil
convenientius duxit quam necem avunculi vindicare tuerique actast Tacitus also speaks
of him (Anu. i. 9) as “ pietate erga parentem—ad arma civilia actum ;” which his enemies
turned ayu'nst him, saying, ‘⁴ Cassii et Brutorum exitus paternis inimicitiis datos, quan-
quam fis sit privata odia in publieis utilitatibnsoemitterest According to Dion Cassius (liii.

j* ' 4) his declama purpose was ὄντως τῷ τε πατρὶ δεινῶς σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι καὶ τήν

Mars, ades et satia scelerato sanguine ferrum; ’
Stetque favor causa pro meliore tuus.
Templa feres et me victore vocaberis ultor.”

This being the case, Horace could not judiciously have passed over the death of Julius
ones-mn an ode which hailedthe return of Augustus ; nor oouldhe have alludedto it better

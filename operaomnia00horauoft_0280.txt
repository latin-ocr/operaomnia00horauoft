HORATII FLAOGI

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium

Custodes ovium carmina fistula,

Delectantque deum cui pecus et nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, Virgili;

Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum -

Si gestis, juvenum nobilium cliens,
Nardo vina merebere.
Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum

Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis,
Spes donare novas largus amaraque
Gurarum eluere efficaX. 20
Ad quae si properas gaudia, cum tua
Velox merce veni: non ego te meis
Immunem meditor tingere poculis,
Plena dives ut in domo.

Philomela into the swallow, and Procne, the
mother of Itys, into the nightingale. A
third version makes Philomela the mother
of Itys. See Hom. (Odyss. xix. 518) z
ἀηδὼν-παῖδ’ ὀλοφυρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον,
which version Ovid seems to follow (Am, ii.
6. 7, sqq.) :—-
“Quid scelus Ismarii quereris, Philomela,
tyranni?
Expleta est annis ista querela suis.
Alitis in rarae miserum divertite funus.
Magna sed antiqua est causa doloris
Itys.’'

So Mart. (x. 51), Soph. Elect. (148), Ca-
tull. (lxv. 14). virgil makes Philomela the

slayer of Itys (Ecl. vi. 79) :—

“Quas illi Philomela dapes quae dona
Infefixarglrg tecta supervolitaverit alis ?’'

In short the legend is more varied than al-
most any other. I have already had occa-
sion to observe how little accuracy was
studied by the poets on such matters (C. iii.
4. 50. n.). Fea quotes a sepulchral inscription
which represents no doubt the grief of the
nightingale (Fabretti, p. 233, n. 612) 2-

8. Reyum] The lust of kings as ex-
emplified in one of them, Tereus. Some
might be disposed to take ‘male' with

‘ barbaras,’ as ‘⁴ rauci male”,(S. i. 4. 66),
and other places (see Index); and I am not
so confident as other editors that it belongs
to ‘ ultar’

9. Dicunt] C. iii. 4. l. ⁴ Delectante ’
(v. 11) is a various reading adopted by
Gesner without much authority, and Bent-
ley reads ‘ nigrae ’ with no authority at all.

tempt to determine who these were, until
it is settled whom the ode is addressed to,
is useless. See Introduction. Catullus,
inviting a friend to his house, says, if hewill
bring the supper, good and plentiful, with
a fair damsel, wine, and good spirits, he will
give him a box of ointment so delicious
that when he smells it he will pray the gods
to make him all nose. Respecting the oint-
ment expressed from the ‘ nardus,’ whether
that name belonged to a shrub or a root,
the reader may consult Schleusner’s Lexicon
and the commentators on John xii. 3.

Mark xiv. 3. There we learn that a pound ι

was worth upwards of 300 denarii, which
sum was equivalent to more than 101.
sterling. The ‘onyx ¹ was another name
for alabaster (see Forcell. ⁴ alabastrites ’), of
which, as we find in the New Testament

as well as here and elsewhere, boxes were,

made for ointments. ⁴ Sulpicia horrea'
were famous wine-cellars which originally
belonged to one of the Sulpician family, and,
according to the Scholiasts, continued to
bear the name of Galba, the cognomen of
a branch of that gens, in their day. There
are inscriptions extant in which mention is

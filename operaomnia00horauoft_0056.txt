HORATII FLAGOI

Et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda

Mobilibus pomaria rivis.

Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo

15

Saepe Notus neque parturit imbres
Perpetuo, sic tu sapiens finire memento

Tristitiam vitaeque labores

Molli, Plance, mero, seu te fulgentia signis
Castra tenent seu densa tenebit

Teucer Salamina patremque

Tiburis umbra tui.

Cum fugeret tamen uda Lyaeo
Tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,

Sic tristes affatus amicos :
Quo nos cunque feret melior fortuna parente

'25

Ibimus, o socii comitesque.

Nil desperandum Teucro duce et auspice Teucro;
Certus enim promisit Apollo

Ambiguam tellure nova Salamina futuram.

Ο fortes pejoraque passi

Mecum saepe viri, nunc vino pellite curas;
Cras ingens iterabimus aequor.

this place into two ; and in some MSS. this
division is found aud a fresh inscription for
the latter half. ⁴⁴ Hanc Oden quidam
putant aliam esse, sed eadem est.'' Porph.

15. Albus Notus] This is the λευκόνυ-
roc of the Greeks. We have also ⁴ candidi
Favonii ’ (C. iii. 7. 1) and ⁴ albus Iapyx ’
(C. iii. 27. 19). In the latter place it repre-
sents a treacherous wind. Horace prefers
the older forms in ⁴ eo‚' as ⁴ deterget‚' ⁴ ter-
ge3e' (S. ii. 2. 24), ‘densentur' (C. i. 28.

19. sulyentia siquis] The standai-ds in
front of the ⁴ praetorium ’ were decorated with
plates of burnished gold or silver. Torren-
tius infers from this allusion that Plancus
was consul at this time; but it will not
bear such an inference. Bothe thinks that
⁴ molli ’ is the imperative mood of ⁴ mollio!
It is an adjective.

In ⁴ tenebit ’ the commentators find sup-
port for their opinion that this ode was

written to induce Plancus to settle quietly3
as if the future implied ⁴ whether you mean
(as Ι hope you do) to take possession of ’
your villa at Tibur!

21. Teucer] Where Horace got this
story from we do not know. ⁴ Cum
fugeret tamen ' is sn imitation of the Greek
καὶ φεύγων ὅμως. But thisuse of ‘ tamen·
is not uncommon in Cicero, as ‘⁴ Quod
ita sit nihil fingam tamen'’ (Verr. Act. ii.
l. 2. c. 73, where Mr. Long has given other
instances). Teucer selected Hercules as his
protector, and so wore a crown of his pophr.

27. duce et auspice] Horace puts tech-
nical distinctions into Teucer’s lips of which
he could know nothing; nevertheless there
is no necessity for Bentley's alteration,
‘auspice Phoebo.' ⁴ Certus ’ is equivalent
to σαφής in εἰ Ζεὺς ἔτι Ζεὺς χώ Aroe
Φοῖβος σαφὴς (Oed. Col. 623). ·

29. Ambiquam] Of doubtful name, ὶ. e.
liable to be confounded with the old Salamis.

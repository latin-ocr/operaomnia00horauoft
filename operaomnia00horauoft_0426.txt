HORATII FLAOGI

Namque est ille pater quod erat meus.'' “ Hoc tibi Paullus
Et Messalla videris? At hic, si plostra ducenta ·
Concurrantque foro tria funera magna, sonabit

Cornua quod vincatque tubas; saltem tenet hoc nos.''

N unc ad me redeo libertino patre natum,

Quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum,

Nunc, quia sum tibi, Maecenas, convictor; at olim,
Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno.

Dissimile hoc illi est; quia non ut forsit honorem

J ure mihi invideat quivis ita te quoque amicum,

Praesertim cautum dignos assumere prava

Ambitione procul.

front benches3 the other that Novius has
not reached the equestrian rank which his
colleague has. Ι incline to think that the
words are only used figuratively. The early
Commentators took them so, and did not
think of the theatre, from which however
the metaphor may be taken.

41. Hoc tibi Paullus Et Messalla]
‘ Paullus ' was a cognomen, which appears in
several of the ‘gentes ς’ but it is best known
in connexion with the Aemilia gens, and the
persons of L. Aemilius Paullus, who fell at
Cannae (C. i. 12), his son the illustrious
conqueror of Perseus, and the younger
Scipio Africanus, son of the latter. The
Messallae belonged to the Valeria gens, one

of the oldest in Rome. This branch of the ⁴

‘ gens ’ were highly distinguished, but Horace
introduces the name probably out of com-
pliment to his friend Corvinus, for whom he
wrote C. iii. 21. As to ⁴ hoc,' in the sense
of ‘propter hoc,' see above, S. l. 46, n.
The same person who puts the question
‘tune Syri, &c.?’ 10 here supposed to re-
join, saying, that though this worthy tri·
bune has a colleague a degree less illus-
trious than himself he need not think
himself a Paulum and besides, though
Novius be his inferior in one way, he beats
him 111 strength of lungs, ‘⁴ and that is what
we like,'' where the speaker ironically puts
himself for the people.

43. Gonnum-aratque soro tria funera]
These would be public funerals, ⁴ funera
indictiva,' at which the corpse of the de-
ceased was carried in processioa from his
house, with the noise of trumpets and 1101110
and fifes3 and women (¹ praeficae’) singing
(111-ἕως and ‘mimi,’ dancers and stage-
players, who recited passages suited to the
occasion, and sometimes acted the part of
merry-andrews, mixing mirth with woe;

Felicem dicere non hoc

and after these came men who represented
the aucestors of the deceased, wearing
masks suited to each characte1'3and then
the corpse on an open bier, which was
followed by the relations and friends all
dressed in black. Τ11ογ went thus in pro-
cession to the Forum, when the bier was set
down, and one of the relations pronounced
a funeral oration, after which the body was
taken up again, and the processioa went 011
with the same noisy accompaniments to the
place without the city (intra-mural burials
were forbidden by the laws of the twelve
tables), where the body was first to be
burnt and then buried. (See Beck. Gallus,
Exc. ⁶ Interment of the Dead.') Τ110 idiom
magna sonabit ’ occurs above, S. 4. 43, ‘os
magna sonaturum.'

48. Quod mihi pareret] See abore, on
v. 25.

49. forsit] A few MSS. have ‘sorsum'
but ‘ forsit ' is in most. The oldest editions
I have seen have all ‘farsam’ Lambinus
restored ‘forsit,’ which is compounded of
‘ fors sit! Whether it occurs elsewhere, og
whether the passages in which it is supposed
to occur are correctly copied, 10 doubted.
Forcell. gives one example from Lucretius
which seems genuine. Horace says it might-
be that people had cause to 311111ὲο 111111
the honourable post of military tribune,
because he was not qualified for it; but no
one could deny that 110 1100011011 the friend-
ship of Maecenas, because he was so
cular in choosing only the deserving.

‘Prava ambitione' means low flattery, to
which Maecenas would not listen.

52. Felicem dicere] ⁸ Felix ' is ‘ lucky!
Horace means he did not owe his introduc-
tion to Maecenas to his luck, but to 1110
friends. As to ‘ hoc,' see above, v. 41, n.
The MSS. vary between ‘possum' aud

HORATII FLAGOI

Ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici,
Pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat;

Hoc amet, hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor.

In verbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis,

Dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum Ι
Si forte necesse est

Reddiderit junctura novum.

Iudiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,

Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis

Continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter;
Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si
Graeco fonte cadent, parce detorta. Quid autem
Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum

Virgilio Varioque ἓ

Ego cur acquirere pauca

Si possum invideor, cum lingua Catonis et Enni
Sermonem patrium ditaverit et nova rerum
Nomina protulerit ἓ Licuit semperque licebit
Signatum praesente nota producere nomen.

sists in, which is, saying every thing in its
right place and time.

45. promis-si carminis] A poem he is
known to have in hand, and which the pub-
lic are expecting.

46. tenuis cautusque serendis,] ‘Judi-
cious and careful in planting his words.'
‘ Tenuis' signifies a nice discernment. The
use of words is the next point notieed, 'skiu
in giving by its connexion new soree to an
old word, or in the introduction of new
terms sometimes borrowed from the Greek,
for the fashion of words is conventional and
liable to change.

49. Iudiciis] Acron says, “indicia re-
rum verba sunt, secundum philosophos.''
As to ‘abdita rerum ’ see C. iv. 12. 19, n.,
and add ⁸ fictis rerum ’ (S. ii. 8. 83), ‘vilia
rerum' (Epp. i. 17. 21). As to Cethegis
see Epp. ii. 2. 117, n. ‘Cinctutus' Porcel-
lini explains as wearing the ⁸ cinctus,’ which
he describes as a garment covering the per-
son from the breast downwards, without
sleeves, and worn instead of a tunic. Ovid
speaks of the attendants on Pan as ‘cinc-
tuti ' (Fast. v. 101): ‘⁴ Semicaper‚ coleris
cinctutis, Faune, Lupercis. ’¹ It appears
therefore to mean one that is only girt about
the lower part of his body, having the arms
free from the encumbrance of the tunic
sleeves. This is referred to in ‘⁴ exsertique
manus vesana Cethegi ” (Lucan ii. 543),
and ‘⁴ Ipse (Cethegus) humero exsertus
gentili more parentum ” (Silius viii. 585).
The use of the tunic by the Romans was
introduced with other indulgences from

Greece and the Greek colonien, tho :noima
having worn only the toga.

54. Caecilio Plautoque] See Epp. ii. ·
l. 59. 170. Asto ‘Romanus’ see C. iii. 6.
2, n. ‘Virgilio Varioque,' S. i. ὃ. 40, ιι.
(That they were alive at this time is quite
an unnecessary assumption). ‘ Catonis et
Enni,’ Epp. ii. 2. 117, n. ν

55. qu cur] Tbe- words which Horace
3¹35?onssss 315¹ {mffimae
Some of those which do not appear in any
other author are mentioned on C. ιίἰ. ll. lo.
To these add ‘ detestatus’ in the sense of
¹ detested' (C. i. 1. 25), ⁴ emiror’ (C. i. 5. 8),
‘ irruptus’ (C. i. 13. 18), ‘maletum’ (C.
i. 22. 14), ‘ambitiosus ⁷ for ⁸ twining’ (C. i.
36. 20), ‘depugis' (S. i. 2. 93), ‘uvesoere’

(S. ii. 6. 70), ‘ disconvenire’ (Epp. i. 1. 99), ν·

⁸ diludium ’ (Epp. i. 19. 47 ), ‘impariter'
(A. P. 75), ‘ delitigo' (A. P. 94). ⁸ juvenui’
(A. P. 246), ‘ socialiter’ (A. P. 258), ‘inm-
beus ' (A. P. 253), ⁴ absture' (A. P. 362).
The construction he here employa is tn·
usual. ‘ Ego invideor ' should, aeeondhss
to usage, be ‘ mihi invidetur,' ss ‘ego lm·
peror' should be ⁴ mihi imperatur ¹ (Epp. i.
5. 21, where see note).
structions and phrases Horace uses aro very
numerous, See Index.

59. Siqnatum praesente uota producere]
Bentley, from a very few MSS.. and agunst
his own as well as all the best and all the
editions, edits ‘procudere’ for ‘producere,’
which signifies to give mrrency to a word
stamped, says Horace, with a modern mark,

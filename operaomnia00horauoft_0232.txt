HORATII FLAGOI

CARMEN XXV.
A.U.c. 724 (Ξ).

Τ1118 ode reads at first like 811 introduction to one on 8 larger scale 111 honour of Augus-

of Alexandria A.u.c. 724.

added to the gods, 8 new and noble strain unheard before? As the sleepless Buind
looks out from the heights upon the sacred hills and rivers of Thtooe, so do 1 love to

· wander by the river-side and in the silent grove. 0 thou lord of the Nymphs, uo

vulgar sta-ain will Ῑ sing. Ι will follow thee, for the danger of thy company is-swoet.

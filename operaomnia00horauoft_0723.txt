‘Usque' in this verse is 88 adverb ofplace‚
notos 11180. 11 means ‘all theway up to
where the poplar stands! The Roman
term ⁸ limitatio ’ properly implied a religious
cuemony by which in earlier times the

private persons. The process by which this

‘limitatio' was effected is described by
Niebuhr very elaborately m the two appeu-
dixe· to the second volume of his Roman
Bistory.“Eve1-y field which the republic
from the common domain was
marked 081 by boundariae. No separation
could take place without such a demarm·

of the latter, although particular estates
within the region subjected to it might still
be part of the domain, it was yet a certain
proof 11181 88011 8 separation had taken

‘limitatio' was to draw 11808 toward the
four qparters of the heaveus parallel and

for them. Hence 111080 bouudaries (⁶11-
mites ¹)were marked by a slip of land lest

balks or ways, as their extremitioe were by

a row of stones inscribed with numerals '’
(p. 624). Niebuhr conjectures ‘⁴ that a
fundus assigned by the state was considered
as 080 entire farm, 88 a whole the 11111118 of
which could not 1ιο changed.” But though
this should be true, aud though each fundus

Τ11080 are such ‘termini' or conventional
boanda-ies as Horace 11οι0 refers to: a
stone perhaps or 88 image of the god Ter-
minus, with a tree or a clump planted near
it. But there were many different kinds of

(quoted from Aggerius Urbicus, 8 writer on
Roman laud-surveying, by Torrentius, who
also refers to Varro, de Re Rust. i. 15:

Varro explains‘ vicina refugit jurgia: where

what the aoristic use of the perfecttense ex-

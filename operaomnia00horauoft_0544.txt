514 HORATII FLAGGI

more, thou son of Maia, than that these may be mine for ever. If 1 have neither
increased my store by dishonesty, nor am likely to waste it through vice or neglect,—if
1 am content with that Ι have, nor have prayed for a slice of my neighbour's field, nor
sighed for hidden treasure,—I ask thee to fatten my flocks, and all 1 have bnt my wits,
and be with me, my mighty protector.

(v. 16.) Now that 1 have retreaoed to my castleinthe mountains, what subject is worthier
of my muse than the spot where I escape from the snares of ambition and the pestilent
winds of autumn? ¹

(v. 20.) J anuS, be thou the beginning of my song. When at Rome thou hurriest me to the
Forum. ‘Haste‚ lest any be at the post of duty and friendship before thee:' and
so in all weathers Ι must go, And when the business is over and Ι have given my
bail, 1 must struggle through a crowd, and be cursed and taunted with ⁴ What are you
about, mad fellow? Are you to be thrusting every one out of your way to get back
with all haste to Maecenas ?’ and this tickles my vanity, Ι confess. And when 1 get to
my friend’s, hundreds of commissions come dancing before my mind. ¹ Roscius
entreated you to be early at the Puteal to·morx·ow.' ‘The Scribae wanted you to
attend their meeting very specially to-day.’ ‘Mind Maecenas puts his seal to this
diploma.' ⁴ I’ll try.' ‘ You know you can if you like!

(v. 40.) It is nearly eight years since Maecenas began to take notice of me, just to the
extent of taking me with him into the country, and talking of most common-place
topics. From that day envy has been growing upon me. If Ι go with him to the
games or the Campus Martius, '‘ Son of Fortunel' cry they all. Is some-bad news
abroad, every body comes to me for information, and if 1 profess ignorance, ⁸ Oh you
are laughing at us, you must know! ‘ Are the soldiers to have their lands in Sicily or
Italy ?’ Though I swear Ι know no more than they do, they only think me the closest

of mortals. And so my life is wasted, and 1 cry, O country, when shall Ι behold thee v

again, and quaff forgetfulness of care in the midst of my books, with quiet nights
and idle days, and light repasts, and pleasant friends, with the wine-cup free, and con-
ference of soul, and the prattle of our good old Cervius. -

(v. 78.) Α good story was that he told us when one commended the wealth of the miser
Arellius, little knowing the anxiety it cost him.

“ Once upon a time,’' said he, ‘¹ a country mouse entertained a city friend in his hole: a
shrewd thrifty meuse, but hospitable neverthelaes. Well, he put before him the best
he had,—pulse and oats, and dry grape stones, and nibbled bits of lard,—to tempt his
dainty palate, while he himself ate nought but coarser grains. Then at length says the
gentleman from the town, ‘ How canst thou endure, my friend, to live in these wilds Ξ
Wouldst thou not prefer the haunts of man to these rough woods? Then haste, come
back with me; life is short3 we all must die; live cheerfully while thou mayst! So
the clown jumps up, and off they set for the city. The night was at its noon when
they entered the rich man’s house, where the bright coverlid clothed the ivery couch,
and plenteous were the remains of the evening’s repast. Then the host sets his rustic
friend on the fine couch, and girds himself up to attend him, changes the dishes, and
tastes before he serves them. While the other is making men-y over his altered con-
dition, lo! the doors creak upon their hinges, the watch-dogs bark, and the trembling
friends rush hither and thither, till safe at last, says the countryman, ⁴ Ι like not this
life of thine: farewell. In my hole in the woods Ι sear no surprises, and 1’11 make
myself happy with my humble fare.' ''

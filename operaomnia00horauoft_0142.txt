112 HORATII FLAOGI

Dices historiis proelia Caesaris, ιο

Maecenas, melius ductaque per vias
Regum colla minacium.

Me dulces dominae Musa Licymniae

Cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum

Fulgentes oculos et bene mutuis
Fidum pectus amoribus 3

Quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris,

Nec certare joco nec dare brachia

Ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro

Dianae celebris die.

Maecenas was an author, though probably
an indifferent one3 and Horace may have
put off his request that he should write a
poetical account of Augustus’ achievements
by suggesting that he should write one in
prose. It does not follow that Maecenas
ever wrote or that Horace ever seriously
intended to advise his writing. ‘ Pede-
stribus' is an adaptation of the Greek
πεζὸς λόγος for ‘ prose‚' or ‘ soluta oratio,’
which latter was the usual expression for
prose in Horace’s time. He uses the word
⁴ pedester' again twice to express a plain
style of speech, but not for prose as opposed
to poetry (S. ii. 6. 17); “ Quid prius illus-
trem satiris musaque pedestri ?'¹ and (A.
P. 95) “ tragicus plerumque dolet ser-
mone pedestri.'' Quintilian uses the word
but expressly as a Graecism (see Forcell.).
The word ‘ prosa,’ or ⁴ prorsa,’ as its correct
form appears to be, is of later use than the
age of Augustus.

ll. ductaque per vias] See C. i. 2. 49;
iv. 2. 35, n. Epod. vii. 7.

12. minacium] The MSS. vary between
⁴ minacium' and ‘ minantium,’ which words
might easily be confounded through the
omission of the mark usually substituted
for ‘n’ in the latter, ‘minatiuml But
the participle would signify that they were
now threatening, which would perhaps be
out of character, though Jani thinks ‘mi-
nantium' very graphio: ‘⁴ Quam graphicum
hoc!'' Jani is abundant in exclamation.
Bentley quotes Ovid (Trist. iv. 2. 2l, sqq.) ε

“ Vinclaque captiva reges cervice gerentes
Ante coronatos ire videbit equos.
Et cernet vultus aliis pro tempore versos
Terribiles aliis, immemoresque sui.’'

⁴ Minax ¹ is a favourite word with Horace.
13. dominae] If by Licymnia is meant

Terentia (see Introduction), ‘ dominae? may

stand for wife, as in Virg. (Aen. vi. 397):

‘⁴ Hi Ditis dominam thalamo deducere
adorti.’' Ovid (Trist. iii. 3. 23): “Nun-
tiethuc aliquis dominam venisse, resurgam ;''
and again in the forty-first verse :-·

‘⁴ Nec dominae lacrymis in nostra caden-
Accetdteiilz ‘if-imae tempora parva mese ?”

tlieffieiitors differ as to the substantive to
which this epithet belongs, ¹ musa,’ ‘ domi-
nae,' or ⁴ cantus.' Bentley edits ‘dulcisl
but quotes the line with ⁸ dulces,’ which he

preferred therefore is plain ς and it is likely -

that the transcribers who wrote ‘dulcis'
meant it for ‘ duloeis: the accusative case.
⁴ Cantus’ wauts an epithct. .
14. lucidum Fuqentoe] Diuenbr. has a
note here in which he says the neuter ad-
jective is used adverbially in phrases like
this, where there is to be expreseed of the
subject not only what it is but what it does.
In this place he says “ oculi tantopere sul-
gent ut lucere videeutur.'' 1 do 'not quite
see the distinction. Had he said “ tantopere
fulgent ut lucere videantur,'' it might be
supposed he meant that the eyes shone so,
they,see1·ned to cast forth lightning, ‘ful-

remark is more clearly verified, since there
he who rejoices is also confused. In
‘ dulce ridentem’ (i. 22. 23); ‘perfidum
ridens' (iii. 27. 67); she who smiles is also
sweet or roguish, and so on in ‘ gratum
elocuta’ (iii. 3. 17); ‘ resonarent triste’
(S. i. 8. 41), &c., but 1 do not see what is
gained by the observation.

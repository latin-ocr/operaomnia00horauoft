ωδ o play of no greot merit more than empty verses md harmonious nonnense.

(v. ³23.) The Greeks had genius end eloquence, md loved pruise above every thing.
Rom boys leun nothing but arithmetic end accounts, and how can we expect them
ever to write poetry worth having?

(v. ³³³.) 1>oeoe wish either to profit or to plene, or to join both these together. Tbere·
fore when you give advice be brief, that the mind may follow and retain your precepts.
A full mind scorns superfluities. Also let your fiction be like truth. The elder-s will
notliaten to that which is immonl, while the younger will heve nothing to do with severe

’ξ poeby. He then is univemlly liked who mingles the profitable with the pleasant.

(v. 347. ) Pei-fection however must not be expected, and allowance may be made for
omsionnl blots; but he who repeatedly soils* m spite of waruing is a mue Choerilus to
me. Iomsurprised and aminclinedto smileif hehssoverse or twothat 'u good,
just ns 1 am grieved if Homer now and then nods.

(v. 361.) Poetry is like pointing: there is some that beers close inspection, some must
be seen at a distance; some beers hearing once, some to be repeeoed osten.

(v. 366.) Medion-ityis tolerable in some things, but not in poen-y: if that does.not mount
to the highest point it siuks to the lowest. Nemi-tham, though they do not attempt
other things for which they are not qunlified, people venture upon poetry who know
nothing about it. Of course! are they not freemen md virtuous and well-to·do in
theworld ,³

(v. ³85.) Yon are too sensible for thiu but if you ever do write, submit your pmductious
to the judgment of your friends, md be in no hun-y to publish them. Words ouce‘
iuued cannot be recelled.

(v. 391.) The first poete civilized mankind, so that Orpheus was said to move beests and
Amphion stenes with the lyre. The philosophy of the olden time lay in framing insti-
tutinus and lawe, regulating society, building dtioe; and by promoting these the poets
won their fame. 'rhen cume Homer and Tymeus urging men to martial deed33
orades were delivered in verse 3 and the duties of life were taught3 and the favour of
princes won; and the husbandmm refroehed aster his toil: so you need not be
ahamed of the lyre-

(v. 408.) It is questioned whether poetry comes by nature or by teaching. 1 think both
must be combined. He who would succeed in poen-y must take great pains while
young, and submit to tenching.12eeve it theu to others to say, ‘I am a fine poet31
will not be lest behind in the tace, or acknowledge that Ι do not know what 1 never
lenmt!

(v. 419.) The rich poet buys flattery. Ῑ should be surprised if such un one could distin-
guish between a true friend and a liar. Ifyou heve made a man a praeent‚or are
going to do so, do not invite him to hem· your verses. He will be sure to applaud
ond weep, or laugh or donce with pretended pleesure. Flntterers are like the hired
mouruers at a funeral, who make more fuss than the friends. But es princes leem
men’s characters hy plying them with wine, so do not you suffer yourself to be deoeived.
Quintilius would tell you plainly to altm- this or that, and if you could not, to strike it
out; or if you preferred retaining it he said no more, but lest you in your self-concm't.
80 every honest man will point out defects of every kind, and never say ⁴ why should
1 offend my friend in such trifles ?’ Thaee trinea become serious matters aster a man
has been laughed at for them.

(v.⁴53.) Awise manwill shun the rapt bard; andis in his finefrenzyhe fallsintoe

Empedocles, who jumped into Aetna to prove himself a god. Why eave oneagoinst

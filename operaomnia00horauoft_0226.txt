HORATII FLAOOI

Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum 5
Fecunda vitis nec sterilem seges
Robiginem aut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus anno.
Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices 10
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget ε te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
Parvos coronantem marino 15

Rore deos fragilique myrto.

signify ⁴ uptumed. The ⁴ s' in the Latin
word corresponds to the aspirate of the
Greek, as in ⁴ silva’ and ὕλη. Compare
Aesch. (P. V. 1005) : γυναικομίμοις ὑπ-
τιάσμασιν χερῶν. As to ⁴ nascente Luna'
see C. iii. 19. 9, n. The prose form of
⁴ hornus ' is ⁴ hornotinus! ⁴ Alumnus ' oc-
curs above (C. iii. 18. 4). The epithet may
have been copied from Lucretius (ii. 1160),
⁴⁴ Ipsa dedit dulces fetus per pabula laeta.”

10. Devota] In the oak woods of Mount
Algidus (in Latium) and the pastures of
Alba were fed swine and cattle, especially
for sacrifice. ⁴ Securim ' (v. 12) is the read-
ing of many MSS. Orelli’s zurich and one
of his Berne MSS. have ⁴ secures.' Bentley
prefers the singular for euphony, -and be-
cause ⁴ victima' is the singular number.
Most persons will decide in favour of ⁴ se·
cures,' and 4 securim ' would require ⁴ pon-
tificis ’ on Bentley’s showing.

18. Non sumptuosa blandior hostia] ⁴ If
the hand be innocent that touches the altar,
not with sumptuous victim more welcome
doth it appease the angry Penates than with
pious meal and crackling salt! Bentley
strangely makes ⁴ hostia ' the nominative
case, in which he follows the Scholiast Por-
phyrion. Acron saw better, and Bentley
could not have read, or must have forgotten
his note, when he says, ⁴⁴ uterque scholiastes
nominativi casus esse monuerunt.'’ The
productiori of the final ⁴ a ' in ⁴ sumptuosa ’
is not indefensible, but it is no defence to
say, as Bentley says, that Martial has (v. 69.
3), 44 Quid gladium demens Romana stringis
in ora ?” for ⁴ str ' is a very different com-
bination from ⁴bl,’ and Horace would not
have taken this licence even with those let-
ters. The real defence has been given above
(C. iii. 5.17‚ n.). But we need nottroubleour-
selves about the matter, for ⁴ hostia' is no
doubt the ablative case. Bentley supposes

⁴ immunis ’ to mean ⁴ empty,’ without an
offering, in which he follows what Lambinus
partly approved. It signifies ⁴ pure.’ It
does not occur elsewhere in this sense with-
out a genitive. In the sense Bentley sup·
poses it occurs twice in Horace (see Index).
⁴ Mollibit,' an older form for ⁴ molliet,' and
one which Horace never uses nor any author
of the Augustan age, was the received read-
ing till Bentley adopted ⁴ mollivit,’ from
many of the best MSS„ which reading is
noticed by Cruquius‚ and was contained in
one of his Blandinian MSS. There can be
no doubt it is right, for, besides other con·
siderations, the aoristic is wanted to
cor-respond with ⁴ tetigi& and it gives the
best sense. When Bentley however argues
that if Horace had written ⁴ mollibit ’ some
at least of the grammarians would have
noticed such an unusual form, he overlooks
Acron, whose note is, ⁴⁴ mollibit: placabitl?
Cunningham, out of opposition to Bentley,
proposes ⁴ mollis-it,' for which there is some
authority. ,
20. Far-re pio et saliente mica] This
means the salted meal-cake offered in nari-
fice. The Roman practice aud the Greek
were different. The οὐλαὶ aud οὐλοχύται
were the entire grain of bmley mixed with
salt. Τὶιθ grain was not pounded by the
Greeks ; by the Romans it was, add the salt
kneaded with it. So ⁴⁴ Dant fruges manibus
salsas '¹ (Aen. xii. 173). The crackling of
the §alt was a good omen. See Tibullus (iii.

‘⁴ At natum in curas hominum genus omina
Faessecgio placant et saliente sale.'’

Socrates was the first among the ancients
who took the view here given of the gods
and their offerings. His opinions arerelated

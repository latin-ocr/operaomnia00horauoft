and next to that, on the first seat of the
‘ imus,’ was usually the place of the host.
But it appears that Nasidienus resigned
that place to Nomentanus, probably be-
cause he supposed him better able to enter-
tain his guests than himself. The host
usually reserved the ⁴ imus lectus ’ for him-
self and his family, as Plutarch tells us in
the above place. If they were not present
their places were usually occupied by de-
pendents of the host (parasites), who filled
up the table, and helped to flatter the host
and entertain the company. This explains
Epp. i. 18. 10, “ imi Derisor lecti.⁷' Some-
times these places were occupied by ‘um-
brae,⁷ brought by the invited guests. See
Becker's Gall. exc. ‘Triclinium.' By ‘ sum-
mus ego’ Fundanius means that he oc-
cupied the farthest seat on the ‘summus
lectus! The slaves in helping the wine
began from this point, and went round till
they came to the ⁴ imus,’ or third place in
the ⁴ imus lectus.' See Plautus (Asin v. 2.
4l), “ Da, puere, ab summo. Age tu in-
teribi ab infimo da savium.'’ These words
Demaenetus addresses to his wife, who, as
above stated, would, according to custom,
be where he says, ‘ ab infimo,’ ‘ima.’

— Viscus Thurinus] See S. i. 9. 22,
n.; 10. 83, n. He appears to have been a
native of Thurii, in Lucania, which was
made a Latin colony A.u.c. 559 (Livy
xxxv. 9), and received the name of Copiae.
But its old name, given it at its foundation
bythe Athenians (ac. 444), continued to
be used as well as the new. Viscus was
highly esteemed by Horace. As to Varius,
see S. i. 5. 40, n. Nothing whatever is
known of Servilius Balatro (as to whose
cognomen, see S. 2. 2, n.) or Vibidius.
The second syllable of Servilius appears
from inscriptions· to be long; the third
therefore coalesces with the last. Maecenas
had taken them with him as ‘umbrae,’
which means persons taken by guests with-
out special invitation from the host. See
Epp. i. 5. 28, n. The MSS. and editions
vary between ⁴ quos' and ⁴ quas.y Orelli
prefers the latter. Ι do not think there is
much to choose between the two. ‘ Super
ipsum’ means on the seat above the host
(see last note). As to Nomentanus, see

S. i. 1. 102. Porcius Comm. Cruq. says
was a ‘publicanus,’ as Nomentanus, ac-
cording to the same authority, was a ‘ decu-
manus! This may have been true once,
but it is clear that they are here introduced
as mere parasites. Suidas, from Plutarch,
mentions one Iortius as a parasite of
Maecenas, which name is supposed to be a
corrupt reading for Porcius, who might in
that case be identified with the person in
the text. Au that we learn of him if that

be so is that, Maecenas having bought a ’

handsome new table, which was not round
according to the fashion of the day but
oblong, after every praise had been ax-
hausted by the company, Porcius wound up
by saying, “ You don't observo, my dear
friends, how beautifully round the table is.”
He would call black white, a square table
round, for a dinner. Here he seems to be
occupied chiefly in filling his own belly, ’
while the host and his other parasite arc
looking after the guests and doing the
honours of the table. ‘Placentae’ were
cakes, often sweetened with honey.

25. Nomentanus ad hoc, qui] ‘Nomen-

tanus was there for this purpose that he ,

might —.' His business was that of nomen-
clator, to direct the attention of the guests
to any dainties they might have overlooked,
and to explain to them the mystery of effi
dish; for, as Fundanius says, the com-
monest viands were so dressed up with
sauces, that they could hardly be recog-
nised, or new sorts of dishes were put on
the table, such as the entrails of different
fish, turbot and plaice for instance. ⁴ Pas-
ser ' is described by Pliny (ix. 20) as a fiat
fish, and is generally supposed to be the
plaice. ‘ Indice digito' is the forefingerz
the middle finger was called ‘ famosus!
Persius calls it ‘infamis ’ (ii. 33), and
Martial ‘impudicus' (vi. 70. 5).⁴ This

‘ medicinalis,' for the same reason probably
that got it the name ‘ annularis,' its supposed
anatomical connexion with the heart. (See
S. 7. 9.) By ‘ cetera turba ' Fundanius
means the uninitiated, Maecenas and his
party. ⁶ Ut vel continuo patuit’ means that

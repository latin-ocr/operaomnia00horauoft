CARMEN II.
A u. c. 738.

The fortunes of Iulus Antonius, son of the triumvir, his rise and tragical end, do not
concern this ode. He was a man of letters and a pupil of L. Crassitius, a gramma-im
who kept a school at Rome, to which many sons of the noble families were sent (see
Dict. Biog. Crassitius). He received therefore a good education, and we have it on the
authority of the Scholiasts that he wrote an heroic poem on the fortunas of Diomed, in
twelve books, besides some prose-works. Acron says that his poem was excellent; but, as
it is not likely he ever saw it, his testimony is not worth much. (See Heyne, Exc. Aensx.
243.) Horace pays him the compliment of saying that he could celebrate Augustus' vic-
tories much better than himself, but this he said to Maecenas (C. ii. 12. ll) ς and, though
from that passage and this we may believe that Maecenas wrote prose and Antonius
poetry, the quality of either and the subjects cannot be inferred from any data Horace
has given us. The Scholiasts write the name ‘J ulius,' but ⁴ Iulus ' is the correct form.
Because we know nothing of Antonius’ poetical powers except from this ode, and because
of the distance between the two names, ⁸ Iule ’ (v. 2) and ‘Antoni’ (v. 26), some critice have
changed ‘ Iule ’ into ‘ Ille ² (Peerlkamp. in loco Eichstadt. Paradox. Horat. i. p. 9), and
supposed ⁴ Antoni ' to mean Antonius Rufus, who is mentioned by Acron (on A. P. 289) md
Comm. Cruq. as one who wrote comedy·; but the existence of such a person is very doubt-
ful, though Suetonius mentions a grammarian of that name, and Ovid ’ speaks of one
Rufus who wrote lyric poetry after the manner of Pindar (Ex Pont. iv. 16. 27, sqq.) ε

“ Et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida vertit; et una
Pindaricae fidicen tu quoque, Rufe, lyrae.’'

But there is no reason to suppose his name was Antonius. In asi-c. 737 the Sigambri,
with two other German tribes, crossed the Rhine and laid waste part of the Roman
territory in Gaul. They defeated the legate Lollius, and this disaster was sufficient to
induce Augustus (Dion Cass„ 54. 19, intimates that he had other reasons, especially his
personal unpopularity at Rome and his intrigues with Terentia, which is mere gossip)
to go in person to Gaul, which he did, and at his approach the Germana withdraw into
their own territories‚ and giving hostages obtained peace. The defeat of Lollius had
caused great consternation at Rome, and the news of the barbarians' subjectioni was hailed
with proportionata joy. Augustus did not return for two years to Rome, having meau-
while restored order in Germany, Gaul, and Spain3 but it is probable this ode was
written in the expectation of his return and while the news respecting the Sigambri was
still fresh, that is to say, about the end of A.u.c. 738. Augustus’ return to Rome was
expected long before it took place (see C. 5 of this book). The general impunesion
derived from the ode is that Antonius had pressed Horace to write a poem in honour of
Augustus’ victory in the style of Pindar' s ἐπινίκια, and that he very wisely deelinod,
tho¹ ugh his friend Titius (Epp.i.3. 10) was more bold, and Rufus above mentioned was

so too.

ARGUMENT.

Whoso would rival Pindar must expect Icarus’ fate. His numbers rou like a swollen

. river. His is the bay, whether he tune the dithyramb or sing of gods and heroes, of
victors or of women bereaved. Τ110 swan of Dirce soars to the clouds ε Ῑ am but as a
bee sipping the flowers of Tibur. Thou, Antonius, shalt sing of the triumphs of Caesar,
greatest and best, and of the holiday rejoieings that hail his return ε and 1 will add my
small voice to thine: and we will all sing songs of triumph and will sacrifice, thou with
bulis and cows, I with a young heifer.

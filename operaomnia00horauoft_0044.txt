HORATII FLAOOI

by nothing we would climb Heaven itsslf, and our guilt suffers not Jove to lay aeide

his bolts.

S1c te diva potens Cypri,
Sic fratres Helenae lucida sidera,

Ventorumque regat pater,
Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga z

Debes Virgilium finibus Atticis

l. Sic] The use of this word in this
place is by no means easily explained. It
is usual to explain it as expressing a wish
dependent on the accomplishment of a con-
dition. It would thus be ¹ so may the
winds favour you as you discharge the debt
you owe.' But in order that the ship
should discharge her debt the winds must
be favourable, and to wish her a favourable
wind and pleasant voyage after she had de-
livered her freight, while without that con-
dition she could not deliver it avall, is non-
sense. Horace seems to mean this—⁶ 1 pray
thee, Ο ship, deliver up thy trust in safety,
and to that end may the stars and wiuds pros-
per thee.’ In Virgil (Ecl. ix. 30) we have
Lycidas urging Moeris to recite him some
verses, and he says :—

“ Sic tua Cyrneas fugiant examina taxos3
Sic cytiso pastae distendant ubera vaccae3
Incipe, si quid habes.''

Here ‘ sic ' expresses an earnestand affection-
ate prayer for the person addressed, follow-
ed by an entreaty to him; but it cannot be
oelled a condition so much as a strong ex-
pression of feeling, and such 1 presume it
to mean in the present instance, where it
amounts to no more than ‘utinam’ in a
strong form, as ὦς does in Greek; the
object of the wish being a means by which
a desired end may be accomplished. There
are other passages where ⁴ sic' follows the
prayer on which it depends, as C. i. 28.

 

‘¹ Ne parce malignus arenae—parti-
culam dare:
Sic quodcunque minabitur Eurus-
and Tibullus (ii. 5, 121) ε
“ Adnue3 sic tibi sint intonsi, Phoebe,
capilli.’' v
In these places the condition and its con-
sequence are clearly marked, and an oppo-
site wish is implied if the condition be not
fulfilled.
‘ Potens,' like its kindred word πότνια,
is used with a genitive after it. Venus

from her supposed origin was imagined to
have power over the sea; hence Horace
calls her‘marina' (C. iii. 26. 53 iv. ll. 15).
She had the titles εὐπλοία, λιμένιας, had
temples built for her in harbona, and is
zffiffifzfflffisffiss’ffi
Paris say of her 2—-

“ Illa dedit smiles somnos ventosque ue·
1311ιῖίέἳέ ἰιῑωῑωω jus habet ora mari ;”

and Luci-et. (i. 8) :—

-. ⁶· 'ribi rident aequm-a ponti,
Placatumque nitet diffuso lumine malumst “

Castor and Pollux had among other titles
that of ἀρωγόναυται. The ap 'on
‘lucida sidera’ is supposed to be derived
stom certain meteoric appesrauoes astet ·
storms, which the ancients supposed to in-
dicate the presence of Castor and Pollux.
Similar phenomena are stin called by the
Italian sailors the tire of st. Elmo, a cor-
ruption it is believed from Helena. Com-

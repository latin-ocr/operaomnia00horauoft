CARMEN XXVIII.

Who was Lyde? A gentlewoman, noble, honest, and learned, also very grave and severe,
but a friend (in an honourable sense) of Horace, says one 3 Horace’s ⁴ villica,' says
another3 his mistress, says a third; .a musician, a dancer, a prostitute3 and so the com-
mentators differ, as well they may, when they try to fix the character and position of one
who may be any body or nobody at all. This ode must have been written some years
after the eleventh of this book, because theu Lyde was but a young thing aud chaste· now
it is clear she had been ιιι the habit of entertaining Horace her lover, and had given him
a supper at more of these annual festivals of Neptune than the present. So says Dacier.
Lyde was the same person as Pyrrha (C. i. 5), says Grotefend; as Lydia, says another
German of less note. But did Horace dine with Lyde or Lyde with Horace on this
memorable 23rd J uly? The critics are as little agreed upon that point as on the other,
and we may therefore assume that Horace, ‘⁴ qui n'aimoit pas la presse,” stayed at home,
eat a quiet dinner, wrote an ode, calling on an imaginary Lyde to drink his health in a
poetical cup of Caecuban wine, and to join him in an amoebean addi-ess, that was never
sung, to the divinity of the day and the. other gods usually honoured on such occasionn.
What little is known of the Neptunalia may be learnt from Smith's Dict. of Anfiq.

ARGUMENT.

Lyde, bring out the best Caecubum and take wisdom by stoi-m, for what can 1 do better on
Neptune’s holiday? The noon is past, make haste. Let us sing3 I of Neptune and
the N ereids, you of Latona and Diana3 both of us together of Venus, and we will not
forget a song for Night.

· Tonsori Licino commiserit. Ο ego laevus,

'⁷ Qui purgor bilem sub verni temporis horam!
Non alius faceret meliora poemata. Verum
Nil tanti est. Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum

Reddere quae ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi;

305

Munus et officium nil scribens ipse docebo,

Unde parentur opes, quid alat formetque poetam;
Quid deceat, quid non; quo virtus, quo ferat error.
Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons:

Rem tibi Socraticae poterunt ostendere chartae,

310

Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Qui didicit patriae quid debeat et quid amicis,

Quo sit amore parens, quo frater amandus et hospes,
Quod sit conscripti, quod judicis officium, quae

Partes in bellum missi ducis, ille profecto

Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique.
Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo

Comm. Cruq. has the following note·
“Licinox nomen tonsoris &mosi qui postea
dieitur sactus senator a Caesare quod odisset
Pomlie‘um, de quo hoc scriptum 051 epi
taphium:
‘Umor-eo tumulo Licinus jacet, at Cato

The name of this n is mentioned by

Juvenal (S. i. 109; xiv. 306), Persius (iiy.
36), Martial (viii. 3. 6, where his tomb is
mentioned); so that the name was pro-

verbial for a wealthy §nvom-ite. Suetonius
(Aug. c. 67) and Dion Cassius (54. 21)
both mention him; and the Scholiast on
the above passage of Persius calls him
“tonsorem ac libertum Augusti Caesaris.”

302. Qui pto-qm· bilem] The hellebore

see above, v. 86, andS. i. 10. 12. Horace
says if he only kept the bile from mping
hey would beat them all at poetry. How-

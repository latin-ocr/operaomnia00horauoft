HORATII FLACGI

Portare ventis, quis sub Arcto
Rex gelidae metuatur orae,
Quid Tiridaten terreat unice 5

Securus.

O, quae fontibus integris

Gaudes, apricos necte flores,
Necte meo Lamiae coronam,

Pimplea dulcis !

Nil sine te mei
Prosunt honores: hunc fidibus novis,

10

Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro
Teque tuasque decet sorores.

zzz: elsewhere. So also Theocritus (xxii.

ἴσκον τοίαὸε πολλὰ, τὰ δ’ εἷς ὑγρὸν ὤχετο
κιΐμίῑ, 5 Ι Ι
πνοιη εχοισ ανεμοιο.

See last note of the last preceding ode.

3. quis] This is probably the dative
case, and refers to the terror inspired in
Tiridates and his party by the approach of
the Scythians. Dillenbr. prefers taking it
as the nominative case, and it is not easy
to decide which it is; in the loose way of
talking Horace may either mean he does
not care who is the king of the Scythians,
or who is afraid of the king of the Scythians.
Either contains meaning enough for the
occasion. See Introduction.

6. sontibus inteyrie]

—— “juvat integros accedere fontes
Atque haurire juvatque novos decerpere
flores'' (Lucret. iv. 2).

9. Pimplea] An adjectivorum Pimplea
a mountain of Thrace* 111 which was a foun-

tain called by the sume 11111110, 011110001οᾱ ’

to the Muses. Bentley adopts the conJec-
ture of N. Heinsius, ⁴ Pimplei‚’ which Fen
has also adopted. But the MSS. arc all in
favour of the other form. For ‘ prosunt'
some MSS. read‘ possunt, 'which Inmbimu

prefers and Bentley adopts. The majority
and best of the MSS. have ⁴ prosunt!

‘Fidibus novis’ are sti-lnge unffled fin
Horace tried them.

CARMEN XXVII.

Porphyrion calls this ode “ προτρεπτικὴ 011 hilaritatem cujus sensus sumptu-estex Ἴ
Anacreonte in libro tertio,'' and Comm. Cruq. quotes the words of Anuzreon which are “

these :—

ἅγε δηῦτε μηκέθ’ οὕτω
πατάγῳ τε κάλαλὴτῳ
Σκυθικὴν, πόσιν παρ’ οἷνω
μελετῶμεν, ἀλλὰ καλοῖς
ὑποπίνοντες ἐν ὕμνοις. (Fr. 63 Bergk.)
(1 suppose δηῦτε is meant by Bergk for δὴ αὖτε. But I need not stop to discum his

Greek, in which he* is not always happy. δεῦτε 15 an obvious correction.) Whether the
remainder of the poem furnished any of the other ideas in Horace's ode, or whether 110
got his scene from life, we mnnot tell. Nothing can sur-pass the good temper and 111-01110110
ease that runs through the ode.

ARGUMENT.

Let barban-ons Thracians fight over their wine—stop your unhallowed 1101500, my friends, ¹
and each lie quietly 011 1115 couch. What, am 1 to join you? Then let that boy toll
me who has got his beart. Will he not? Then 1 drink not. Whoever it is, thou
hast no cause to be ashamed. Here whisper itin my ean—Ah! poor boy, what ι
Charybdis hast thou got into! What witch, what god shall deliver thee? Pegasus
himself could not do it.

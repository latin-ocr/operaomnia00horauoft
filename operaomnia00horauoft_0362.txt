“ At si condoluit tentatum frigore corpus,

HORATII FLACCI

80

Aut alius casus lecto te adfixit, habes qui
Adsideat, fomenta paret, medicum roget ut te
Suscitet ac gnatis reddat carisque propinquis.''
Non uxor salvum te vult, non filius; omnes

Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae.

Miraris, quum tu argento post omnia ponas,
Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem?
An si cognatos, nullo natura labore

Quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amicos,

Infelix operam perdas? ut si quis asellum

ln Campo doceat parentem currere frenis.
Denique sit finis quaerendi, quumque habeas plus
Pauper-iem metuas minus et finire laborem
Incipias, parto quod avebas, ne facias quod

Ummidius quidam 3 non longa est fabula: dives

“Pauper Opimius argenti positi intus et
auri.'’ ‘ Tentatum ' in the next line is the
word commonly used in connexion with
diseases. See Forcell.

80. At εἰ condoluit] I do not see the
necessity for understanding this ironically
with Heindorf and others. It seems to be
an argument urged by the avaricious man:
‘if you have money you will have anxious
friends to nurse you in sickness.' Orelli
puts a (?) after ‘propinquis‚’ and supposes
the meaning to be, ⁴ if you are sick will any
one nurse you and pray for your recovery?
Not one! This is not a bad interpretation.
But ‘at ’ seems to be the introduction of a
reply, which use it so often serves·

81. lecto te adfixit‚] The old editions
nearly all have this reading. Most MSS„
and among them those of the Berne, have
‘afflixit‚’ which Lambinus and Cruquius
adopt, and the former declares the correct-
ness of that reading is not to be doubted.
He adopts the same in S. ii. 2. 79. He
takes it to have the same meaning here as
there, ‘illiderel But it is not suitable in
either place. Bentley has aptly quoted
Seneca (Ep. 67): “Ago gratias senectuti
quod me lectulo affixit3 '¹ and Cicero (in
Verr. Act. ii. l. 5. c. 7): “Pater grandis
natu jam diu lecto tenebatur.''

85. pueri atque puellae] This, which
appears to be aproverbial sort of expression,
occurs again S. ii. 3. 130.

88. An εἰ οορηαίοε,]
seek to retain and keep the affection of those
relations whom nature gives you without

⁴ But say, if you

any trouble of your own, would you lone
your labour, like the luckless fool that tries
to turn an assinto a racer?’ ‘Nullo labore’
cannot go with ‘ retinere,' as Dacier and
others take it. The position of the words
forbid it, and ‘operam perdas' would have
no meaning. ‘ Sine labore tuo' is Por·
phyrion's explanation, and ‘ gratuitos' is
Acron’s‚ though he notices the other. ‘ At
si’ is the reading of the Scholiasta, of the
old editions, aud most MSS. ⁴ Ac si' is in
others, and Heindorf adopts it. Various
other readings have been proposed, bnt ‘at’
or ‘ an' are the best. Orelli adopts ‘au’ on
the authority of his two oldest MSS„ those
of Berne and St. Galle. With either the
sentence should be pointed interrogatively.
Training an ass to run in the Campus Mor·
tius among the thorough-bred horses that
were there exercised (see C. i. 8. ὃς iii. 12.
8) was perhaps a proverbial way of express-
ing lost labour. ‘⁴ Hoc de asino proverbium
aut proverbiale est'’ (Porph.).
belongs to ‘ cognatos' in the way Ι have
translated it.

92. quumque habeas plum] This is the
reading of all the MSS. Some editors have
adopted ‘ quoque' on the conjecture of
Muretus. Heindorf had that reading. In
his last edition it is altered to ¹ quumque!
⁴ The more you have you may sear poverty
less,' would be an encouragement to hoard-
ing instead of a dissuasion. What Horace
says is, ⁸ Since you have more than others,
you should sear poverty less!

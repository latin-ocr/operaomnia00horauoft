318 HORATII FLAOGI

Caputque Marsa dissilire nenia.

Quid amplius vis? Ο mare, 0 terra, ardeo, 3ο
Quantum neque atro delibutus Hercules

Nessi cruore, nec Sicana fervida

Virens in Aetna fiamma; tu donec cinis
Injuriosis aridus ventis ferar

Cales venenis officina Colchicis. 35
Quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium?
Effare3 jussas cum fide poenas luam,

Paratus expiare, seu poposceris

Centum juvencos, sive mendaci lyra

Voles sonari: Tu pudica, tu proba 40

(Acron). It is not easy to get a good word
that literally renders ‘ increpare' here.
‘Nenia' is used for a charm, as in ovid
(A. A. ii. 102): “Mixtaque cum magicis
nenia Marsa sonis.” (Fast. vi. 142):
“ Neniaque in volucres Marsa figurat anus.''
It is also used by Horace for a night-song
(C. iii. 28. 163 Epp. i. 1. 63); for the
melancholy poeti-y of Simonides (C. ii. l.
38); and in its proper sense of a dirge for
the dead (C. ii. 20. 21). Cicero (de Leg. ii.
24): “ Honoratorum virorum laudes in oon-
tione memorentur easque etiam cantu ad
tibicinem prosequantur, cui nomen nenia.'’

33. Virmn] Forcellini interprets this,
with Lambinus and Cruquius, ‘nunquam
intermoriens. sed perpetuis vigens ignibus‚'
and Ι am inclined to adopt that interpre-
tation rather than that of Orelli and Dil-
lenbr.¹ who explain it by the sulphureus
green flame issuing from the mountain. 1
doubt whether there is any thing in the
colour of the flame to authorize such an
epithet, and Bentley makes the same re-
mark. Orelli quotes the authority of his
Ziirich and oldest Berne MSS. for ‘ virens,’
and Lambinus found it in his oldest MSS. :
in the others was ‘urens,’ which he calls
‘longe ineptissimum! No doubt it arose
out of ‘ virens,' and is so far a confirmation
of that reading. Cruquius' Scholiast had
‘vireus,’ and he interprete it ‘aestuans'
which means nothing. but it shows what
was his reading. Bentley prefers ‘ furens,'
which Lambinus mentions as resting only
on conjecture, but which has since been
found in a few MSS. os no great weight.
Like some other emendations it is too easy
to be admitted against the vast majority of
MSS. ‘ Furere' is commonly applied to
flames, but that only makes it less likely

that such a word should have been super-
seded by one so unusual as ¹ virens!

35. Cales] Bentley would change this
into the third pers0n3 to do which he is
obliged to change ‘tu’ into ‘tmss to tho
great detriment of the verse, and introducing
the possessive pronoun where it is not
wanted. There is no doubt he is wrong.
The received reading is as old at leastts
Porphyrion, who says ‘⁴ ipsam mulierem
officinam* venenorum diserte dixit‚” and so
we must take it till some better emendadum
than Bentley’s is offered.

36. stipendium 7] Forcelliui explains
this as “quaevis multa aut poena‚” and
quotes Catullus (64. 173): ‘¹ Indomito nee
dira ferens stipendia tauro Perfidus in Cn·
tam religasset navita funem;” but thero
the word comes more under tho senso of
⁴ tributum: of which he gives several in-
stances, the reference being to tha tribub
or sacrifice of one hundred youths pou
yearly to the Minotaur. As au equivalent
for ‘ poena ¹ I do not find that ‘ stipendium '
is used elsewhere. It is possible it may
name ‘ service,' which is its military sensa
Ι have used the word ⁴ penalty' in the argu-
ment. but the meaning is doubtful. ⁴ Quo
finis ’ means ‘what death?' (See C. ii. 18.

29, n.) Captives led in triumphwere always ·

put to death. See Ep. vitum.

39. Centum juvenc-ved This is the read·
ing of the MSS„ but Bentley prefers ‘ju-
vencis‚' asin C. i. 4. 11 he preferred ‘agna'
and ⁴ haedo! 1 prefer the acmsative ln
bothplaces. ‘Sono' is used as an active
verb only by the poets, after the mannes·
of ἠχεῖν. The satire of what follows is
very amusing. In his ples for forgiveness
he repeats his offenoe, implying that to call
her chaste he must lie, which however he is
willing to do. The following words ars tho
substance of what he promises to say in her

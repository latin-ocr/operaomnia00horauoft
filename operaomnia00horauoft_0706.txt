676 Δ HORATII FLAGCI

Vis complere libris et vatibus addere calcar,

Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem.
Multa quidem nobis facimus mala saepe poetae,
(Ut vineta egomet caedam mea‚) cum tibi librum
Sollicito damus aut fesso ; cum laedimur unum
Si quis amicorum est ausus reprehendere versum;
Cum loca jam recitata revolvimus irrevocati;
Cum lamentamur non apparere labores

Nostros et tenui deducta poemata filo ;

Cum speramus eo rem venturam ut simul atque
Carmina rescieris nos fingere commodus ultro
ArcessaS‚ et egere vetes, et scribere cogas.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales
Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique

Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae.

Gratus Alexandro regi Magno fuit ille
Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis
Rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.
Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt
Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo
Splendida facta linunt. Idem rex ille poema

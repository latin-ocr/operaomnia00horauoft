18. Trana Tiberim—cubat ia] ¹ Cubat '
is generally taken to mean that his friend is
lying sick, and 1 am inclined to think it can
have 110 other meaning here. In other
places where it occurs it might be supposed
&give this signification from the context.

t. ii. 3. 289 :— .

‘⁸ Mater ‘ait pueri menses jam quinque cu-
Fribgindtesi puerum quartana reliquerit ;”

’01111 Epp. (ii. 2. 68) :—

“ —· cubat hic in colle Quirini
Higmefjremo in Aventino, visendus uter-

raum (eas. Prot 37) 2-

“ ——- servus qui in morbo cubat:
Immo hercle vero in lecto ne qui mentiar ;’'

ami other places usually quoted for this
meaning. But 1 see no other sense to gIve
the word here that is supported by usage
(“ He lives above a mile of ground Beyond
the Tiberf' which is Francis's translation,
is an unexampled meaning to give the word,
but many have adopted it); and moreover
it is likely Horace would invent this excuse
by way of shaking off his companiou. In
cic. Verr. (ii. 3. 23, where, see Mr. Long's
note), ‘ cubaret ’ means no more than that
the man was in bed. Julius Caesar had
some plasme-grounds, which 110 bequeathed
⁷ to the Roman people, on the right bank of
the Tiber, near (says Turnebus) to the

, Porta Portuensis, that is, not far from the

Pons Sublicius. This would be a long way
fmm the Sacra Via.

22. non Viscum pluris amicum] In the
next satire we have (v. 83) “Fuscus et
haec utinam Viscorum laudet uterque;”
and at the supper of Nasidienus (11. 8. 20)
we have ‘⁸ Summus ego et prope me Viscus
Thurinus, et infra Si memini Varius.'’ On
the present passage Acron and Comm.
pmq. say that Viscus was “ disertus
1111110 temporis homo,'’ and some said he
was a poet, and 0 friend of Horace's.

Porphyrion has here the name ‘Fuscum’
(or, as it appears in Ascensius’ text twice
over, ‘ Tuscum')‚ 01111 says he was a distin-
guished writer of tragedies. Here he is
associated with Varius, and in the latter of
the above passages a Viscus also appears in
Varius’ company. In the former there are
two Visci and a Fuscus, and Varius just
above. All this creates some doubt as to
the reading here. Aristius Fuscus was one
of Horace's most intimate friends (C. i. 22,
Introduction), and we meet with him below
(v. 61) 10 0 very humorous character. It
is perhaps better to suppose one of the
Visci to be meant here, for he plainly held
them both among his best friends (lo. 83).
As to Varius, see above on S. 5. 40.

23. quis me scribere plures Aut citius]
Τ110 ignorant fellow here fastens upon the
very faculty that Horace held in the greatest
contempt (S. 2. 9, sq.). On Hermogenes,
see S. 3. 129, 11. Τ110 opportunity sor in-
terrupting the prater which Horace seized
upon is not very apparent. Orelli and others
say because 110 was determined not to listen
to the 111-01000 of Hermogenes, whom 110
detested. 1 am not sure that we are not to
understand that the man gives a specimen
of his voice as he gives out the words ‘ ego
canto! But however this may be, Horace
gets in a word, and, trying toresign himself
to his fate, and to turn the conversation to
topics too unmeaning to give a handle to
the man's vanity, he asks him if his father
and mother are alive: ‘quis te salvo est
opus ' is only a formula of civility. Τ110
man who has 110 feeling for any one but
himself, answers with indifference that he
has buried them all, which gives occasion
for Horace to exclaim internally, he wishes
he was dead too. What follows ῐ suppose
we must understand as a quaint notion
passing through Horace’s own mind,—one
of those pleasantries that sometimes rise up
to mock men in despair. Certainly we are
not to imagine that he is speaking to his
persecutor, which the whole of his conduct,
and the absence of any reply, show that 110
10 not.

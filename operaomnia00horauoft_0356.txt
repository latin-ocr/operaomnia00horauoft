HORATII FLAOGI

Momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta.''
Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus,

Sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pulsat.

spoilt by such a process. (See above, C. ii.
18. 23, n.) What Orelli says, that in Cicero
the formula ⁴ quid enim ’ is always followed
by another question, only shows how little
necessity there is for interrupting the sen-

tence as he does, by an interrogation after
those words. Fea’s reading, ‘ quid ni?’

which was suggested to Lambinus by a
friend of his, and which he liked, but sup·
posed it to want authority, which has since
been supplied by four of Fea’s MSS„ is as
bad as possible. Acron has the following
note ‘¹ quid enim: quare non t et est co-
micum,'' from which it is inferred his read-
ing was ‘ quidni? ⁷ Whether that be so or
not, the reading is a bad one. ⁴ Horae
momento ’ is a common phrase in Livy and

other writers. Horace has below ‘ puncto·

mobilis horae! ⁶ Punctum ¹ is perhaps a
little more precise than ‘ momentum,’ which
signifies the progress of time, though con-
ventionally its smallest division. Pliny
. 111-5555 a distinction between them (Panegy.
iv. c. 56): ‘⁴ quod momentum, quod immo
temporis punctum aut beneficio sterile aut
vacuum laude ἓ ”

8. Memento cita mors venit] Lambinus,
on the authority of four of his MSS„ but
against all the best, reads ‘momento aut
citas and Bentley follows him, saying,
that without the disjunctive particle the
reading 1s‘ ‘ominosum plane et infaustum.’'
Heindorf puts in the particle, but 1 think it
is better omitted. It gives too much pre·
cision to the sentence, considering the posi-
tion of the speaker, as Reisig observes.

legesque viris’ '.(Aen i. 507). “Haec nos
juris, legum, urbium societati devinxit”

tion between‘ leges’ and‘ jus' 500 Smith' s
Dict. Ant, article‘ J us 'and Mr. Long’s
Excursus on Edicta Magistratuum (Cic. 111
Verr. p. 165). Cicero (de Orat. i. 48) thus
defines a jurisconsultus: ‘⁴ Sin autem quae-
reretur quisnam jurisconsultus vere nomi-
naretur, eum dicerem qui legum et consue-
tudinis ejus qna privati in civitate uterentur,
et 511 respondendum et ad agendum (Er-
nesti has ‘scribendum ’) et ad cavendum
peritus esset, et ex eo genere Sex. Aelium,

M. Manilium, P. Mucium nominarem.

The same M. Manilius he says (in the same

GARMEN IV.
A.U.c. 729.

'flnisamusing ode represents a gentleman in love with his maid-servant3 a circum-
muco of suffidently common occurrence to wumnt the suppositiou that Horace may
hauh-d oneof his friends inview,and that the ode is founded on fact. Thema
Xanthia must be fictitious, and Phoceus indimus that the person was also supposed to
bc ι Phocion. It is usual to suppose that ‘⁴ Xanthia Phoceus” represents two names,
md‘ ‘ud Xanthiam Phoceum” is the common inscription, as if Phoceus were a latin
me, which the second line proves itis not. why Horace, assuming a Greek name for
hisredorsupposed ffiend,shou1dalsomakehim a Phocian, who cun pretend totell?

“S-y it was his humourss' or there may have been a significunce in it which has passed
my, or never existed but for the understanding of the person addraesed and perhaps u
few intimate friends. Xanthias was ο name given to slaves, like Geta, Sodus, δια, as in
the ‘⁸ Progs ” and other plays of Aristophanes.

'rho date of the ode cannot be mistsken. Horace was born A.11.c. 689, and he wrote
this ode when he was just finishing his eighth lustre, which would be iu December,
A.u.c. 729.

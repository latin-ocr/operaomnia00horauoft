HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN XXXVII.
A.U.c. 724.

The occasion that gave rise to this ode, and the time therefore of its composition, are
sufficiently clear. Intelligence of the deaths of M. Antonius and Cleopatra was brought
to Rome by M. Tullius Cicero (M. F.) in the autumn of A.u.c. 724. Horace appears

to have started with an ode of Alcaeus (20 Bergk) on the death of Myrtilus in his head.
It began,

νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν
πίνην ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.

The historical facts referred to in this ode may all be gathered from Plutarch's life of

M. Antonius, and from Dion Cassius, at the end of the fiftieth and beginning of the fifty-
first books.

ARGUMENT.

”ris time to drink, to smite the earth, and set out a feast (for the gods, my friends. We
might not bring down the Caecuban while that mad queen with her foul herd were
threatening Rome with destruction. But her fury is humbled, her fleet in flames, hei·
drunken heart shook with fear when Caesar hunted her from Italy as the hawk pur-
sues the dove or the hunter the hare, to chain the accursed monster; who feared not
the sword nor fied to secret hiding-place, but was bold to see her palaoe laid low,· and
to drink in her veins the poison of asps, her oourage kindling as she resolved to die
rather than be dragged in triumph by the conqueror.

NUNC est bibendum, nunc pede libero
Pulsanda tellus, nunc Saliaribus
Ornare pulvinar deorum
Tempus erat· dapibus, sodales.
Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum ’ 5
Gellis avitis, dum Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et imperio parabat
2. nunc Saliaribus] A Saliaric banquet
is a rich banquet, fit for the Salii. C. ii. 14.

fin„ and Lectisternium.) ‘⁴ Saliares· coenae .-

“ Sic igitur tarda vires minuente senecta
Me quoque donari jam rude tempus erun

quas Salii faciebant: dicuntur amplissimi
apparatus fuisse& unde et in proverbio erat’:
{2132ss coenas dicere op1paras et coplosas'
ll, sq.) :—
“ Non Albana mihi sit commissafio tanti
Nec Capitolinae Pontificumque dapes.''

4. Tempus erat] This imperfect tense
seems to mean that this was the time that
the fates had intended for such festivities,
though it is difficult to determine its precise
meaning. Ovid (Tr. iv. 8. 24, sq.) has it
twice over in this unusual way :—

Hence Martial says (xii. 48.

Nec siccam Getico fonte levare sitimst'

Th0 Greeks used the imperfect ἐχρῆν in
the same undefined way. Two exnmples
from Aristophanes will be enough :—
ἐμοὶ μελήσει ταῦτά γ’, ἀλλ’ ἣκειν ἐχρῆν.
(Pax, 1041.)
οὐκ ἐχρῆν ζητεῖν τινα
σωτηρίαν νῷν, ἀλλὰ μὴ κλᾴειν ἔτη
(nquit. 11, sq.)
See note on i. 27. 19.
6. Οείἰίε] The ‘ cella' was properly
speaking a chamber partly above and partly

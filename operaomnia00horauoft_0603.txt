vineyards close to one another may produce
wines of very different quality.

6. creme vel imperium sen] “Fetch
it or else put yourself under my ‘impe—
rium,’”as if he as master had the ‘im-
poeimn’ at his own table. Martial (xii.
48. 15) has something like this:

“Convivas alios coenarum quaere magister,

Qutqqeqapiant mensae regna superba

For the full meaning of ‘imperium’ see
Dict. Ant. ‘Arcesso' is compounded of
‘ar’ (which is equivalent to ‘ad’) and
‘ cesso,' which involves the same root (⁴ ci-’)
as ‘cieol Many MSS. and editions read
‘aocet-sel which wagner on Aen. v. 746,

says is a form belonging to the age ‘ca-
dentis latinitatis! It is more likely a cor-
ruption of the MSS. Fen quotes in support
of ‘arcesso,’ from the Calendar- of Verrius
Flaccus, a grammarian of Horace’s time,
found at Praeneste, Am. 1773: ⁴⁸ Quod
Mater Magna ex Libris Sibuninis Ancus-
srra locum mutavit ex Phrygia Bomam.”
See Forcellini and Key’s L. G. 547, note
on 753 on the suffix ‘ess,' and 1312 on

‘ar‚' which he says is rarely if ever used,
except in composition. An exception no-
ticed by Professor Key is found in Plautus
('rruc.ii.2.18):“Aneobeuaoetuquam

clepsisti? Arme advenias? Seealso

mean that the fire was lit, but that the

‘'focus, by which he means probably that
which stood ιιι the Atrium, near the imagae
of the Lnrae, and which was probably of
bronze, had been burnished and made gay
for the occasion. Different spedmens of
braziers have been found at Pompeii, all
moveable, and varying in size and
some of them combining a hot-water appa}
ratus with a charcoal trough. ‘'Supellex

such as was of gold or silver, gilded or
plated; that is, it included tnbles of all
sorts, chairs, benchae, couches (even when
they were ornamented with silver) with
their drapery, footstools, napkins, cande-
labra, lamps, and all sorte of veesels of

eafing or drinking. (Dig. 33, tit. lo, quoted
by ForoelL, where one or two exceptions in
respect to plated things are mentioned.)
Wearing apparel was not included, and
perhaps ivory ornaments. (hom (Agrar.

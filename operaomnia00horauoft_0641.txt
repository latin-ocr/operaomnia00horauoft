Τίμαιε ιο the Armenians, be having been
for some time living' ιιι exile at Rome. Tbey
put uae reigning king Artaxias to death and
moeived Tigranes, because they had chosen
to hue him for their king. yNevertheless
it appears that a coin was struck for the
occasion with the inscription anuas-’m
carm.

—jue imperiumque Phraates] The re-
stontion of the standands of Crassus took
place Ars-c. 734. The account of Justin,
quoted in the Introduction to C. i. 26,
does not state the case accurately as

this transaction, and the musas
which led to the restoration are so variously
stated by the historians that it is difficnlt
to form any opinion from their statements.
Suetonius (Aug. c. 21) merely says:

affair), et signa militaria, quae M. Crasso et
M. Antonio ademerant, reposcenti reddide-
runt: obsidesque insuper obtulerunt. '’ Ta-
dtus (Anu. ii. l) says: “Phraates quan·
quam depulisset exercitus ducesque Ro-
manos, cuncta venerantium officia ad Au-
gustum verterat partemque prolis firmandae
amicitiae miserat, haud perinde nostri metu
qnam fidei popularium diffisus.’' It suited
the Romans to make the most of the con-

cassinus of the Parthian king, and the re-
covery of the standards, which was probably
an act of policy independent of any sear
of Roman invasion, was proclaimed as a
triumph and recorded upon coins with the
inscription sicms Bacenis. Horace al-
ludae ιο the circumstance not only here but
in C. iv. 15. 6, where the standards are
represented as torn down from the proud
walls of the Parthians3 and in Epp. i. 18.
56, where the same ’fiction is re
That Augustus was particularly anxious ιο
hide the fact that the Parthians were not
afraid of him may be inferred from the
frequent assertion that they were so- (See
C. iv. 5. 253 C. S. 53, sq.; S. ii. 5. 62;
Epp. ii. l. 256.) On the ‘Monumentum
Ancynnum’ (p. 35, ed. Franz. quoted by
Orelli) Augustus recorda that he compelled
the Parthians ιο restore the spoils and
standards of three Roman armies, and to
seek as suppliants the friendship of the
Romans. What Horace here says is, that
Phraates accepted or put himself under the
law and‘ imperium’ of Angustus, prostrat-
mghimself at his knees (‘ genibus minor '),
-ωῗι ridiculous exaggeration. ovid is nearly
as strong (Trist. ii. 227);

“Nunc petit Armenius pacem; nunc por-
rigit arcus

Propertius in the following places refers
prospectively to the recovery of these stan-
dards, showing how much importance the
Romans attached ιο it (ii. lo. 133 iii. 4. 93
5. 48; iv. 6. 79). On this subject see
C. iii. 5. 3, and Introduction.

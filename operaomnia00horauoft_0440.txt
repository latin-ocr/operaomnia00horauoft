HORATII FLAOGI

Vindemiator et invictus, cui saepe viator ἱ 30
Cessisset magna compellans voce cucullum.

cuckoo, and the joke oonsists in the pussen-
ger telling the vine-dresser that the cuckoo
was coming, and would find his trees un-
pruned, which was as much as to call him
’ 0 lazy feuow. Lambinus aptly quotes
Ausonius (Idyll. x. 161) 2-

‘⁴ Summis quippe jug-Is tendentis 111 ultima

The Greeks had a proverb to the same effect,
explained by the Schol. on Aristoph2 Av.
507. “ Τ110 verse in virgil, ⁴ Hinc alta sub
rupe canet frondator ad auras' (Ec. i. 57),
naturally occurs, when in our walks under
the rocky cliffs of Posilipo we see the
peasant swinging from the top of a tree on
a rope of twisted willows, trimming the
poplar and the luxuriant teudrils of the
vine, and hear him make the whole vale
ring with his rustic ditty. A classic scholar
cannot stroll under the groves of the plain
without calling to mind Horaoe’s ‘ durus
vindemiator,' &c., if he attend to the vine-
‹lresser sitting among the boughs lashing
raw 10113 and bashful maidens 03 they return

{rom market with the same gross wit 0011
rough jokes that gave such zest of old to 1110
fai-ces of Atella ” (Swinburne, vol. i. p. 116).
10 ‘Vindemiator' the third syllable 000-
lesces with the fourth. See C. iii. 4. 41,
and add S. ii. 3. 245: “Luscinias soliti
impenso prandere coemptasss' i. 8. 432
“ Imagine ceres Largior arserit ignis. ”
i. 2. 21: “Neque ostrea Nec senus 0111
poterit? &c.

nenum‚' ‘ sal,' ¹ 00011110,’ are au words well
chosen for describing the poisonous charae-
ter of these men’s 1001100. Plautus 11303 the
last of thaee words⁴ two or three times.
Bacch. (iii. 3. 1)· “Nunc experiar sitne

34. qui reyes consuet-u tollere, ] It
would have spoilt the Greek' s joke, and lost
him his cause perhaps, had it then been sup-
posed, as some have in these days supposed,
he alluded in ‘ reges ' to the death of Caesar.
It was not 0 subject for a jest, though
Brutus might still believe 110 had done 1110
state a service by the part he took- 111 that
murder. The man must be supposed to
allude to him whom Brutus 0101111011 sm· his
ancestor, L. Junius Brutus, who helped to
expel the last of the kings. The plural
‘ reges ' does not stand in the way of this
explanation. Rupilius is brought into com-
parison with Tarquinius in 1110 first'line of
the Satire “ Proscripti Regisst διο.

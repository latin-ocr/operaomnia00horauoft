360 HORATII FLAOCI

SATIRE IV.

Here again Horace is at pains to defend himself from the charge of malevolenoe.
That this charge was loudly brought against him is clean and the second Satire of this
book may have gone a long way towards making him enemies. But he must have
written many more pieces than that, for he speaks of ‘ mea scripta’ (v. 23), ‘meosl
libellos’ (v. 71). It 1s probable his other Satires were in the same sti-ain as the second,
which appears to have been published as a specimen of the style he here defends, but
which he thought fit to abandon, for there are no other Satires of that kind. independent
of the above, Horace here shows something of an author’ s soreness in respect to the
neglect his poema had met with, compared with others which he believed to have less
merit, and though he attributes it entirely to the jealousy and fears of the multitude,
every man apprehending that he may be attacked next, it ιε clear that he puts it down' ιιι
some measure to a false taste which preferred a wordy flowing style to the terseness and
accuracy of his own. The poems of Lucilius were popular in spite of the looseness of
their composition, and many defecta which a depraved taste had come to regard as merite.
(See note on v. 6.) The virulence of Lucilius’s Satires did not affect Horaoe’s genera-
tion, who could afford to admire them, but had no liking for verses that came home to
themselves. Horace began his career as a satirical writer with Lucilius-for his model,
and the second Satire is a specimen of the style resulting from that imitation. It sat ·
uneasily upon him. Lucilius he found, with all his power and his merits, was not the
model for him, and he was probably taunted with coming short of the vigour of his
original, and this perhaps by the persons who were loudest in charging him with a
malignant temper. He had therefore to set himself right in respect to Lucilius, and this
he does both here aud elsewhere (S. lo and ii. l) with much good temper, candour, and
forbearance. He has also to contrast'his own pretensions with those 'of the Crispinuses
and Fanniuses of the day, as well as to quiet the apprehensions of his friends, and disarm
the malignity of his enemies, and these are the objects of the Satire. Everybody ‘must ι,
admire the way iu which he takes occasion, from the necessity of sels—defeuce, to pay a
tribute of grateful affection to his father’s memory, and it would be difficult to find a more
pleasing picture of paternal solicitude and sound sense, as applied to a boy' s education,

than Horace has drawn ιιι the latter part of this Satire.
About the date, Franke says it must have been written before A. u. c. 716, when

Asinius Pollio first introduced the practice of regular recitations of their works by authors.
He says Horace would not have treated the reciters so contemptuously if their practico
had come into fashion through the example of his friend Pollio. As Ι have said on v. 73,
1 do not think the practice alluded to by Horace has any thing to do with Pollio's practice3 ’
and as to Fannius' books and bust having been deposited, as some have said, in the
library built by this same Pollio in A.u.c. 715, there is not the remotest reason to believe
it. Franke says Horace could not at this time have been on good terms with Augustus,
or he would not have mentioned ‘⁴ acerba irrisione '⁷ Petilliua Capitolinus (94, sqq.), who
was a friend of his. But the only bitterness in Horace's words is in the sneer which he
puts into the mouth of Petillius’ friend and condemns. In short, the Satire appears to
me to contain no clue to its date3 but it evidently concerns Horace’s early reputation,
and so must be placed early, and not very long after S. 2, which he quotes in v. 92.

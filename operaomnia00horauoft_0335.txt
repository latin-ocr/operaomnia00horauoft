Et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus. 5
Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo.
Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec fortasse benigna

Reducet in sedem vice.

Perfundi nardo juvat et fide Cyllenea

Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus;

Invicte, mortalis dea nate puer Thetide,

Τ110 expression θεῶν ἑν γοί νασι κεῖται
, (odyss .i. 267), which Dillenbr. quotes. and
which the Scholiast explains' εν θεῶν ἐξουσίᾳ
ἐστι’, does not appear to have any bearing
upon this . It rather seems akin to
that expression of Solomon (Prov. c. xvi.
v. 33)‚⁴ ‘sse lot 15 oest into thelap p, but the
whole disposing thereos is of the Lord.’'
But, however this may be, ‘ dum virent
genua ’ means merely ⁴ while our limbs are
strong and we are young! See Theoc. xvii.
70, where Wuestemann has collected various
examples. Dacier says truly the tottering
of the knees is one of the first signs ot' old

‘’Seneetus is no where else used in this
sense of‘ melancholyl though‘ senium’ is
not uncommonly. See Foroell., who does
not notice this use of ⁸ senectus! ‘ Tu’ 15
the master of the feast. Sex. Manlius Tor-
quatus was consul A.u.c. 689, when Horace

sule Manlio'’ (iii. 21.1).

7. Cetera] See Introduction, and C. i.
9. 9: ‘¹ Permitte divis caetera.”

8. in sedem] The commcntators quote
the words of Augustus’ edict (Suet. Octav.
28): “Ita mihi salvam ac sospitem Rem
Publicam sistere 10 sua sede liceat.”

Achaemenio] Venet. 1483, and nearly
all the editions till Bentley's, with Comm.
Cruq‘. and many MSS. have‘ Achaemenia. ’
Bnt‘ nardum' is the word, not‘ nardus,' as
10 Epod. v. 59: “Nardo perunctum quale

9. fide Cyllenea] The lyre invented by
Mercury, born 00 Mount Cyllene 10 Ar-

cadia. ⁴ Diris‚' not ‘ duris.’ is the reading
of the oldest editions aud nearly all the
MSS. Bentley prefers the latter.

11. Centaurus] Cheiron, the instructor
of Achilles. Orelli has collected a large
number of places in which this subject is
mentioned. Whether Horace took what
follows from any story or not it is impos-
sible to determine, as in the similar episode
of Teucer in C. i. 7.

qrandi] Juvenal (vii. 210) describes
Achilles as a big boy at school, “Metuens
virgae jam grandis Achilles Cantabat patriis
in montibus? ’‘but grandis’ has not that .

Homer’s description (11. 1311. ¹⁵¹.)²

This is an adaptation (ἒῖ

ψυχρῇ. ‘Domus ‘proles Assa-
raci, ’are commonin Virgil. Assaracus was
great-grandfather of Aeneas. Homer took
a more heroic view of the (1111100510οε of the
river Scamander, which was μέγας ποταμὸς
βαθυδίνης (11.11. 73). Bentley suggests
‘proni' for ¹ parvi; 'others have proposed
‘pravi’ (that' 15, ‘tortuous ',‘) puri,’ ‘flavi,’
‘tardi’ But the MSS. do not vary.

15. subtemine] ⁴ The woof of the web.'
⁴ Certo subtemine' means only by an un-
alterable destiny. There is no noed of
Bentley’s alteration to ‘ curto, ¹ nor of
taking ‘ certo subtemine’ with ‘ Paroee‚’ as if
it were the adverb of quality, signifying the
‘ Parcae' whose woof of destiny is unalter-
able. Sec Catuu. 64. 328, &c. ε
ducentes subtemina currite fnsi.''

“ Currite

‘ Mater
merula ' means Thetis, not the sea, as Com.
Crnq. supposes.

18. alloquiis] If the true reading is
without any conjunction, ‘alloquiis’ would
appear to be in apposition with ⁴ vino can-
tuque! There is no other instance of ‘ allo-
quium ’ being used otherwise than with refer-
ence to conversation. But Horace may have
followed, after his custom of imitating the

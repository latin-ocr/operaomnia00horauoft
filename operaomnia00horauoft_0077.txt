rather than of Bacchus and Venus, when he is mellow?

But that no man exceed, let

him think of the bloody frays of the Centaure, and Lapithae, and of the Thracians,
oven-their cupa, when the appetite confounds right and wrong. 1'11 not arouse thee
unbidden, beautiful Bassai-eus, nor drag thy mysteriae from their secret places.
’ Silence the horn and drum, whose followers are vain glory and broken saith.

Nouum, Vare, sacra vite prius severis arborem

’ Circa mite solum Tiburis et moenia Catili.
'Siccis omnia nam dura deus proposuit, neque
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines.
Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat. ἲ 5
Quis non te potius, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus. ²
At ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi
Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
Debellata, monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,

Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum

lo

Discernunt avidi. Non ego te, candide Bassareu,
Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus

Sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecyntio
cornu tympana, quae subsequitur caecus Amor sui

Et tollens vacuum plus nimio Gloria verticem,

Arcanique Fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro.

2. muris et moenia Cauta] ἓν διὰ δυοῖν.
See C. i. 7. 13, ιι. Horace shortens the
penultimam syllable of Catillus' name for
the sake of the metre, and the same liberty
ia taken with the name of Porsenna, Epod.
xvi. 4, where see note.

8. super mm] It is disputed whether
thia meana* over their wine,' or ¹ about their
wine! The latter is the more ordinary sig-
nification of ‘ super’ with the ablative3 but
in Aen. ix. 61, we have ⁴ nocte super medin:
which auctions the other version, and this
gives the boet sense. The story is that at the
mossinge-feast of Peirithous, king of the
lapithae, the Centaurs, being gnests, at-
temptedin their drunkenness ω mrry off the

10. C'um sas atque uffae] ‘When the
greedy of wine distinguish between right and
wrong by the slender line of their lusts,’
that is, the slender distinction that lust so
inflamed can draw. ⁴ Avidus’ is used abso-
lutely for ¹ avidus pugnae,' C. iii. 4. 58.

“ qualis commotis excita sacris

where Servius in his commen
this passage of Horace. The whole passage
is Greek in its character. The Liberalia
bore little analogy to the Dionysia to which
the thyrsus and the cista with its sacred
contenta (whatever they may have been)
and its covering of vine and ivy belonged.
The picture of vain glory holding high its
head, full only of the summ os debauch,
is very happy whether original or not.

in brief, and with sufficient accuracy for the purpose of this commentary, most of the
events of Parthian history which Horace alludae to, and will serve for reference hereaster.
The assembling of the Scythian force and the alarm of Tiridates are evidently referred to
manathetwoseem to be associated. Itisnaturaitoinferthereforethatitwasjnst
before Tiridates ssed from his kingdom, in Ast-c. 729, that the ode was composed. Some,
however, have referred it to the period when Phraates’ ambassadors were in neaty with
Augustus, and when the fate of Tiridates was undecided‚ which would put the date a year
later. Others again have usumed that the whole of the transactions described by Justin
aretobereferredtotheyear724, and that'l‘iridates neverfledtoAugustus in Spainat

unwan-rantable jndgment. J nstin had before his eyes the history of Trogus, which he
ahfidged, and must have known better than Lachmann what it contained. His reason,

when fl» hethren ase Phraates and Tiridates. TbeGeorgics havingbeenwrittenin
724, it is assumed that the events above referred to must have taken place before that
year. But the earlier and unsuooessful designa of Tiridates are more probably referred
to by virgil. Against the earlier date there is an argument of much weight in the age of
Iamia- He died A.U.c. 786 (Tae. Ann. vi. 27). and the year before he had held the
office of praefect of the city. If he was only twenty when this ode was written, he must
have been eighty-two when he died, and eighty-one when he held the above post, which
was made one of considerable importance by Angustus, and continued to be so under his
succemor. 'He is described a's being ⁴ vivida senectute ' at the close of his life, and it is
just possible he may have held the above post at that advanced age, but it is not probable,
andlthink itafairargmnent, asfarasitgooe,sor pntting the date ofthe ode as late
as we em. For further particulata mpecfing Lamia see C. iii. 17. The attempt to
deduce fiom this ode any evidence of his being of a melancholy temperament is ridiculous.

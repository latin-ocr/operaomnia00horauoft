13. ced equi frenato est auris m ore.]
Bentley, on very slender authority, changed
‘equi,’ the common reading, to ‘equisl
But though some good MSgS. have since
been found to confirm that reading, Ι agree
withOrelliinpreferring‘ equi! It givaea
little more meaning to the words to apply

·them to the horse to which the words of

the rider are addroesed.
16. vina nihil moror illiue orae .·] The
nearaet place to Salernum spoken of as
growing winoe is Surrentum (Sorrento), at
the end of the promontory that bears its
name, and forms the southern boundary of
the buy of Nap loe. This wine is mentioned
in S. ii. 54 55. Ovid (Met. xv· 709) mentions
“Surrentino generosos palmite colles3¹ ’and
Martial speaks of this wine with praise (xiii.
110). But Horace had no high opinion of
it(seeC. i. 9. 7, n.); andStatius speaksof
“Curaque non molli juga Surrentina Lyaeox’

Pliny also (xiv. 16) says that 'riba-ius de·
clared it was no better than vinegar, and
only owed its character to the doctors.
Horace did not think it worth while to ask
about the wine, which he knew was bad.

17. perferre postqum] This pleonasm
occursagain in the next Satire,v.74.1t
εει-τω to make up a verse. 1 am not aware
it has any other force.

pmasite who was ready to dine any whoee,
paying for his dinner with his jokes.

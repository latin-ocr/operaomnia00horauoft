362 HORATII FLAGGI

On the other hand, if he would prevent me from doing something wrong, he would say,
‘⁶ Can you doubt about its impropriety when you see the ‹ii-grace it has brought upon
so and so? As the intemperate are checked by seeing their neighbour carried to the
grave, so young persons are often kept from crime by the shame it brings upon others.'’
Stich was the training that has made me what Ι am, free from grave faults, if not from
venial, and even these will diminish with time and reflection, which I practise every day.
When I have leisure Ι put my thoughts into writing, which is one of my little sins3
for which sin, if you will not make allowance, I shall bring all my pack to help me,
and we shall make a convert of you whether you will or no. “

Eupoms atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae,

Atque alii quorum comoedia prisca virorum est,

Si quis erat dignus describi quod malus ac fur,

Quod moechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui

Famosus‚ multa cum libertate notabant. 5

1. Eupolis atque cratinus Aristophanes-
que] These three represent the Old Comed y,
of which they were the acknowledged
leaders. See Quintilian (x. l): ‘⁴ Plures
ejus auctores: Aristophanes tamen et Eupo—
lis Cratinusque praecipui;'' and Persius
(S. i. 123) :—

“ —— Audaci quicunque afflate Cratino
Iratutniaugipolidem praegrandi cum sene

The vigour and boldness of Cratinus'
writings is described by Aristophanes
(KnightS, 526, sqq., and elsewhere), who
was about seventy years his junior, though
they were rivals the year before Cratinus'
death, 13.c. 453, when he won the first
prize, and Aristophanes the third with the
Clouds. The satire of Eupolis was also
very unsparing, as we learn as well from
other notioes as from the story (true or
false) that Alcibiades had him thrown over-
board at sea for lampooning him. The
other writers of the Old Comedy, whom
Horace alludes to with respect, are very
little known to us. Their names, with those
of the writers of the Middle and New
Comedy, may be found in Clinton (F. H.
v. ii. pp. 36-47), and a few are noticed in
Donaldson's Greek Theatre (pp. 106—114).
The distinction was invented by the Alex-
andrine grammarians. The old ended with
Aristophanes. The middle was supported
chiefly by Eubulus, Antiphanes, Anaxandri-
des, and Alexis, and lasted over about fifty
years of the fourth century 1³.c. Of the
New Comedy, which the Romans imi-
tated, the principal writers were Philemon,
Menander, Diphilus (see Prol. Adelphi),
and Posidippus, who was the last of the

Greek comic poets, and died about lac.
230. Schlegel (Dram. Lit. Lect. vii.)
denies the existence of a Middle Comedy,
with which question we are not coneerned
here, but need only observa that Horaoe
fixes on-the Comoedia Prisca, because the
subsequent phases of the Greek Comic
Drama were not of the same personally
satirical cast, the license granted to the
old writers having been taken away by law.
The new comedy was like our own, using
the lang-uage of daily life to show in an
{3133 ζίζῑὲῗξ, ἓῗῗῖιῗῗιῑὲξὲἳέἒῗζῖῑὲἐ
of human natm-eg while the old dealt in
invectives against social, politieal, or in-
div'idual vices dressed up in grotesque hn-
guage and images. It is to the langunge
of the New Comedy that Horace refers in
this satire, when he puts the question
whether a comedy is or is not a
Between his own writings and the Old
Comedy there is little or no analogy. The
words ‘ poetae' and ‘virorum' are used
emphatically, as below in S. 10. 16: “Illi .
scripta quibus comoedia prisca viris est.”

5. multa cum libertate notabant] Cicero
(de Repub. iv. 10) says that to the Greeks
‘¹ fuit etiam lege concessum ut quod vellet
comoedia de quo vellet nominatim dioeret.”
All he could mean was, that during the
period of the Old Comedy, the law did not
interfere with this liberty, except upon two
occasions (only one of which occurred during
the time Aristophanes was writing), when
psephisms were passed prohibiting the in-
troduction upon the stage of living charac-
ters as objecta of satire by name,——a restric-
tion of no great force, since the substitution
of a feigned name, slightly altered from the

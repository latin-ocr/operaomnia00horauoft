72 HORATII FLAGOI

CARMEN XXXIII.

ste extant elegies properly attributed to Tibullus mention only two mise-esses of his,
under the names of Delia and Nemesis, and these are the only two that Ovid mentions in
the beautiful elegy he wrote on that poet’s death (Amor. iii. 9. 31, 55, sqq.). Of the
person he calls Delia he was enamoured during the earlier part of his life; of Nemesis
during his later years. (He died between thirty and forty, about the same time as Virgil.)
Much has been written to prove that the Glycera of this ode stands for Delia (see parti-
cularly Spohn de A. Tibulli vita et carm. p. 50. 96, who believes that Delia, Nemesis,
Glycera, Neaera—a name occurring only in the third book, which Tibullus it is pretty
certain did not write, were all the same woman). Others have identified Glycera with
Nemesis, on account of the number and quantity of the syllables being the same, and the
epithets Tibullus applies to her, ⁴ avara,’ ⁴ rapax,’ ‘ saeva,' ‘ dura,' which correspond to
Horace's ‘immitis.' Dissen is certain that Glycera is neither Delia nor Nemesis, but
another mistress otherwise unknown. Orelli is of the same opinion, but adds that those
who thus attempt to settle to a nicety the loves of Roman gentlemen, and pretend to
know more about them than they have told us, only create a smile among those who have
lived long in France or Italy,—-implying that his countrymen were bad judges of the
amusements of their more gallant neighbours. It is not even certain that Tibullus wrote
the pitiful elegies Horace speaks of. Glycera is one of Horace's favourite names, and
cannot be taken for a real name here or elsewhere. It occurs in Plautus (Mil. Glor. ii.
5. 26); and Martial (xiv. 187). Whether the person had any more realitythan the name
or the verses is I think doubtful. That Tibullus wrote elegies, that he was not rarely
crossed in love, and that he was on some occasion in a desponding humour, are facts
sufficient to form a probable foundation for this good-tempered little poem. whoevar
goes further than this will find he is out of his depth.

Horace was much attached to Tibullus, who was a favourite with his contemporaries.
To him was addressed the fourth epistle of the first book.

⁴ ARGUMENT.

Come, Albius, do not be drawling pitiful poetry upon Glycera, because she prefers a
younger man to you. Pretty Lycoris loves Cyrus, Cyrus inclines to Pholoe, who
admires the vulgar sinner as the she-goat loves the wolf. Such are Iaove's diversione.

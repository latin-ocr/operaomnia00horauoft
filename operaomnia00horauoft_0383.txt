SATIRARUM I. 3.

353

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homo 2 ini
Tardo cognomen pingui damus. Hic fugit omnes
Insidias nullique malo latus obdit apertum,

Cum genus hoc inter vitae versetur ubi acris

fio

Invidia atque vigent ubi crimina, pro bene sano
Ac non incauto fictum astutumque vocamus,

⁴ Simplicior quis et est, qualem me saepe libenter
obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut sorte legentem

Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus,

65

Communi sensu plane caret, inquimus. Eheu,
Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam !

Nam vitiisnemo sine nascitur ;

optimus ille est‘

Qui minimis urgetur. Amicus dulcis ut aequum est

doubt of its belonging to the latter, and it
strengthens the common interpretation—-
veryabject man.' Compare v. 147 of
this Βαιέιιι,ί ‘multum celer atque fidelisl'
“Multam similis metuenti” (S. ii. 5. 92).
lambinus, with some authority, inserts
‘'oet before‘ demissus! Itdoesnotappear
in the hest 1188, but' is understood. Hein-
doefs interpretation οῖ’ et' aster· pingui'
isunnthorized and awkward. The dative
‘pingui' is coi-rea, as‘ ‘cui nnnc cognomen
Iulo Additur” (Aen. i. 267). It is the
common construction, in prose as well as
many, to put the name in the dative.
cim (in Verr. ii. 4. 53) has “cui no-
men Arethusa est;” but there Profe-§or
Key (Ia. G. 984, note) thinks “we should
probably read Arethusaaet, i. e. Arethusae
δι” This seems to imply that the other
construction would be wrong, but it is used
ffetimes. Some MSS. have ¹ pinguis ’ in
59. nalo] This is masculine: he lays
himself open to ιιο malignant person, g'rvoe
him no handle. ‘ Hoc' is like ‘horum ho·
minum’ (v. 30). Bentley adopts and de·
sends‘ versemur, ' the reading of the oldest
Blandinian MS. But the other is at lenst
asgoodarending, andbetter supported. 1
believetheabove MS. is the only poonethal:
Μ· versemur.r In connexion with what
follows, the commentators quote Livy (xxii.
89): “Pro cunctatore segnem pro cauto
timidum, affingens vicina virtutibus vitia,
compellabat. ” By ‘simplicior’ Horace
means ‘unsophisficated·’ one who in the
. simplicity of hisfeelings may perhaps some-
time· obinde himself upon those he likae,
thinking he must be welcome because he is
himselfplemed to meet them. He says he

hasoflenactedin thatwnywittheoenae.
This Satire therefore was not written very
early' ιιι their acquaintance.

63. Simplicior quie et αὴ] See Intro-
duction.

65. impellat] Forcellini givos no other
instance οἰ* impellere’ in the sense οῖ’ ιιι-
terpenaress but givoe it that sense here.
Lambinus reads ‘appellet3' Crnquius‘ ap-
pellemg’ Bentley conjectum‘ impediat) at
the same time ealling Lambinus’ conjecture
ingenious and learned. ΤΙιε Scholiast' s
interpretation is ‘in et;’ the reading
of every MS. is ‘impellatss and I do not
feel inclined to adopt Bentley’ s emendation
or his explanation of the received rending,
which, for the benefit of those who have
more scruple than himself' ιιι desei-ung the
MSS„ he tells us must mean nndging your
friend with your elbow, or pushing him, to
draw his attention. The instrument is
plainly not ‘ cubito’ οι· ‘'m,anu as he
su ,‘but sermone, ’and the meaning
is that he breaks ιιι upon one when reading
or meditating with some irrelevant talk.
Some MSS.g says Fen have ‘modaetusl
He dooe not name them. He separatas

‘molestus ' from the preoeding words, and
reads ‘⁸ Molestus! Communi sensu plane
earet, inquimus.'’ ‘Common sense,’ for
which the Greeks had the expression ὁ κοινὸς
νοῦς, is so called, not as being exemised
upon common every-day things, but as being
supposed to be common property, and not
confined to the learned.

67. leqem sancimus] ‘Sancite legem’
is properly to give full effect to a law by
inserting a penalty for the breach of it.
SeeCic.deAm.c.13:“Haecigitm-prima
lex amicitiae πέποιθ’

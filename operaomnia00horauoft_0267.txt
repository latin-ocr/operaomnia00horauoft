Ithink Orelli's notion, that

17. Quis neit] This may or may not be
imitated from Euripides (Alc. 783) :—

oi’m ἔστι θνητῶν ὅστις ἐξεπίσταται
τὴν αὔριον μέλλουσαν εἰ βιώσεται.

For ‘summae ’ there are MSS„ and among
othe-s the Blandiuiau above mentioned,
which read ‘vitae,' which also appears in
Ven. 1483, but it is only a gloss. No copy·

21. splendida] This isan unusual wo)rd
for such a meaning. Foroell. interpr-ets it

25. Hor-aee follows the Greek legend

the dead, being brought to life by the skill
of Aoeculapimg See also Aen. vii. 765, sqq.
The common story of Theseus aud his friend
ie,thatbothhavingbeeneons1gnedtotheir
punishment together, Hmule· went down
and delivered Theseus, leaving Peirithousto
his fate I do not see why this should not
be the legend Horaoe follows z it may be
understood that Theseus pleaded for Peiri-
thous when he was himself returning, but
failed to obtain his release. Dillenbr. sup-
poses Horace to have followed some different
legend or to have altered the common me

himself.

The differenoe between ‘fugitivus ’ aud
‘eno' is explained by Ulpian (Dig. 21.1.
17), quoted by Foroeffini, under the letter
word. ‘l'he whole passage is: “Rrronem
definit labeo pusillum fugitivum esse, et ex

’ diva-so fugitivum magnum erronem osse,

sed proprie monem sic definimus qui non

nsum, et tempon'bus in res nugatorias
consumptis serim ed dominum redit.”

Opus ruri faciundum.”

And Gmmio in Plautus (Mostell. i. 1. 15) Δ

“ Sane credo, Tranio,
Quod te-in pistrinum scis :ctutum tudier,
cis hercle paucas tempestatem Tranio.
Augebis ruri numero genus feri-stile ;''

where ‘genus ferretile' means the men
with feners, who are called in the samo

play (ii. 1. 9) “ fenita-ibam viri.”

Ur proficiscentem docui te saepe diuque
Augusto reddes signata volumina, Vini,
Si validus, si laetus erit, si denique poscet;
Ne studio nostri pecces odiumque libellis

Si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,

Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum
cognomen vertas in risum et fabula fias.
Viribus uteris per clivos, flumina, lamas ; ιο
Victor propositi simul ac perveneris illuc,
Sic positum servabis onus, ne forte sub ala

Fasciculum portes librorum, ut rusticus agnum,
Ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae,

volumes would depend upon the number of
books into which the work was divided, as
each book, if it was not very long. would be

3. Se· validam] Augustus had very un-
certain health, as Suetonius informs us (vit.
e. 81): ‘⁴ vaoe et periculosas valetudines
per omnem vitam aliquot expertus estl’
Be had some diseasoe that returned an-
nually, and he was generally ill about the
fime of his birth-day (23d September); at
the beginning of spring he suffered from
cholic, and in the autumn from catarrh.
So that, Suetonius adds, in the shattered
state of his body he could hardly bear either
cold or heat. In winter he wore an extra-
ordinary quantity of clothing, as many as
four tunioe with a subucula (Epp. i. 1. 95),
and a woollen covering for the cheat, and
trowsers or leggings of some sort. In the
hot weather he slept with all the doors open
and a man to fan him. He never went out
inv the sun without a broad-brimmed hat
(⁸ petasus '); he generally travelled at night,
and in a litter, and very short distancesg
and he preferred going by sea when he
could. He took the care of his
health: seldom bathed, and washed in tepid
water3 rarely and cautiously he used hot
medicated baths for his nervoe. He took
little exercise latterly, and that only walk-
ing or gently running. Notwithstanding
all this he lived to be seventy-six. His
physician aflzer the Cantabrian expedition
(a.u.c. 730), when he was very ill with

liver complaint, was Antonius Musa, con·
cerning whom aee below (Epp. 15. 3).

lo.1mas.·]·rhiswoxd isonly found
elsewhere in a verse of Ennius, quoted by
Comm. Cruq. and by Torrentius from 'au
old MS. Comm. Cruq. thus explains
⁴ lamas :' “lacunas majores continentes
aquam pluviam seu caelestem. Ennius:
‘ Silvarum saltus, latebras lamasque lu-
tosas) ’' Acron also says: “ lama est aqua
in via stans ex pluvia;’' and Porphyrion:

“lamestvoragm λαμός enim aet ingluvies.
Lamiae quoqne dicuntur devoratrices puero-
rum.’' (As to ⁸ Lamiae) see A. P. 340.)
Torrentius mentions an old Iaexicon which
has “Lamae: πηλώδεις τόποι;” and For-
cellini quotes Festus: “ lacuna, aquae col-
lectio quam alii lamam alii lustrum dicunt.”
Horace writes as if the manwas going some
arduous journey over hius and rivers and
bogs,whereas he had but thirtymiles or
thereabouts to go along a good md, the
Via Valeria, which pm very near the
valley of the Digentia.

14. ylonmae fiat-divae Pyrrhia lances]
Comm. (h-uq. says Pyrrhia is the name of a
slave in a play of Titinius, who stole some
wool and carried it away so clumsily that
shewas detected' Titiniuswas awriterof

rhia is formed from Pyrrha, the name of a
town in Lesbos, like Lesbia, Delia, διο.

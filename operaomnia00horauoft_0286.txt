HORATII FLAGGI

Te copias, te consilium et tuos

Praebente divos.

Nam tibi, quo die
Portus Alexandrea supplex

’35

Et vacuam patefecit aulam,
Fortuna lustro prospera tertio
Belli secundos reddidit exitus,

Laudemque et optatum peractis

Imperiis decus arrogavit.

40

Te Cantaber non ante domabilis
Medusque et Indus, te profugus Scythes
Miratur, o tutela praesens
Italiae dominaeque Romae.

Te fontium qui celat origines

45

Nilusque et Ister, te rapidus Tigris,
Te beluosus qui remotis
Obstrepit Oceanus Britannis,

ὥστ’ ἀμητῆρες ἐναντίοι ἀλλήλοισιν”ογμον
ἐλαύνωσιν.

32. eine clade] See note on v. 13.

33. te—Praebente divos.] See C. i. 7.
27, n. Augustus had the ‘auspicium,' and
his stepsons were his ‘legati.’

34. quo die] See C. i. 37, Introduction3
iv. 4, Introduction. It is not improbable
there may have been some representation
of Alexandrea Supplex in Horace's day,
such as the well-known figures of Judaea
Capta and Judaea Restituta on medals of
Vespasian and Hadrian. We do not hear of
Augustus having caused such a medal to be
struck3 but, as he had a triumph for the
capture of Alexandria, such a commemora-
tion of the event may very well have taken
place. On the reverse of a medal of Hadrian
Alexandria is represented as a matron re-
clining with three ears of corn in her hand,
and the same number springing ont of her
foot3 while her left arm rests upon a cup
with a vine-branch springing out of it, and
a bunch of grapes hanging over its side.

40. Imperiis decus arroqavit.] ‘ Claimed
for the wars carried on under thy impe-
rium the glory thou didst desire. ' At-
tempts have been made to fix other mean-
ings on ⁴ arrogare' here, and in Epp. ii. 1.
35; but this ordinary sense of the word
suits both passages. What follows is a
compendious review of the successes of
Augustus, all of which have been noticed in
these odes. Before the pmsent ode was
written the Cantabri had been finally subdued
by Agrippa3 the Parthians had restored the
standan-ds of 'Crassus and M. Antonium the

Scythians had sent to ask to be taken into
alliance3 the distant nations of Asia had
done the same (see C. S. 55, sq.) ς the suc-
cesses of Lentulus had checked the inroads
of the' tribes of the Danube (ii. 9. 23);
Egypt had long been a tributary province ς
Armenia (Tigris) had been oeded by the
Parthians3 Britain, though only threat-
ened, had sent tokens of submission. Au·
gustus was just returned from Gaul and
Spain, where he had put down the last
efforts of rebellion, having also driven back
the German tribes, whose success against
Lollius had thrown a stain upon the arms
of Rome (see C. 2 of this book, Introduction).

45. Te sontium qui celat origines] This
applies only to Nilus. Ι am not awa-re that
it was ever said of the Ister. The ancient
representations of the Nile exhibit him as
covering his head with his robe, or with the
waters flowing from under his robe; while
the Ister is exhibited with his urn in a
medal of Trajan, on whose column he is
represented as rising out of his stream to do⁶
homage to Rome.

47. beluosus] This word does not oocur
elsewhere in any classical writer. It re-
duces to the form of an adjective ‘ scaten-
tem beluis ' (C. iii. 27. 26). It oon-responsis
to πολυθρέμμων of Aeschylus, πολυκὴτης
of Theocritus, and Homer’s μεγακῆτης.

49. Te non paventis funera Galliae]
Caes. de B. G. vi. 14: “ In primis hocvolunt
persuadere (Druidae) non interire animos
sed ab aliis post mortem transire ad alios,
atque hoc maxime ad virtutem excitari
putant, metu mortis neglecto.’'

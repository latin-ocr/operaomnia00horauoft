Formo retired from public affairs, in which he had taken an active part for twenty years,
aster the triumph he obtained for his victory over the Parthini, an Illyrian people, A.u.c.
715 (v. 16), and betook himself to literature, but confined himself at first chiefly to dra-
matic writing. It appears from Suetonius (de Illust. Gram. c. 10) that he did not unda-take
his history tiu after the death of Sallust, rme. 720 (see cunum, Γ. Ἠ. a 39 n.c.)‚for
it was after that event that he became acquainted with the grammarian Atteius, who fur-
nished him with mles for composition. And if the history was not began till that year,
even though (as is probable) Pollio should have taken notes of most of the transactions
he had to relate, with a great many of which he had been personally connected, it is not
probable that so large a work, consisting of seventeen books, and taking in the whole
period from the first triumvirate to the conclusion of the civil wars, could have been so
far completed as to be communicated to his friends before the year A.u.c. 723, which wau
the year of the battle of Actium. But the words ‘⁴ arma nondum expiatis uncta moribus '’
(v. 4, sq.), coupled with ‘⁴ cui dabit partes scelus expiandi Juppiter ’' (C. i. 2. 29, sq.),

make it likely that these two odes were written about the same time; that is to say, “ ⁴

shortly aster the battle and before Augustus had established his government in the con-
fidenoe of the people. It is true Lambinus and some of the older commentatas were of
opinion that the history of Pollio is not meant, but only his tragedies, which they say
related ω the events of the times, and which Horace wishes him to lay asido for 'a while
and give his attention to public affairs, until the republic should be settled. So they in-
terpret
-——“ mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno.”

But there is no reason to suppose any of Pollio’s tragedias had reference to the offonis of
the day, while his history related to nothing else. The Scholiasts understood the history
to be referred to (see note on v. 10).

The ode was written aster hearing Pollio recite part of his work ; a practice which he
is said to have been the first to introduce among literary men at Rome.

ARGUMENT.

The civil wars, their causes, their faults, their progr-ess, the spor-ts of fortune, and the
fatal leagues of chiefs, and arms stained with blood not yet atoned for,-—a danger-nus
task is thine, and treacherous is the ground thou art treading.

Leave the tragic Muse for a little while, and thou shalt retum to her when thou hast

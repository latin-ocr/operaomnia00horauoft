CARMEN XX.

ιω. 730 (ε).

Ῐιι the thirteenth ode of the second book Horace relatee how he was nearly killed by
the filling of a tree. In the seventeenth ode of the same book he associatee this aed-
dmt with the recovery of Maecenas from sicknees, and his reception with applanse in tho
theme. Theeighthof thethinibookwaawritten on the first anniversaryof hisand-
dent, and ssierefore the year aster Maeoenas' reoovery. ΤΙιε dates therefore of both
these eve-ts to which the oden that more exproealy belong to them give no clue, may be
determinedif we ean determinethatof Cm 8. lt will be seen by referring to the
inuodnuion to that ode that there is great differenoe of opinion upon the subject, and

-; but small means of deciding it. But upon the date of Maeeenas’ recovery depende the
:J date of this ode, in which he is invited to drink some Sabine wine bottled on that oeen-
'³ dion. Now wine of this sort was not in its prime under four years’ keeping (C. i. 9, 7, n.),

 

and was not likelyto have been fit to drink under two years. After, therefore, the reader
ζ hasaafisfiedhimaelfbetterthanlmnsatisfyhimofthedateofC.ii.13andl7,hewill
« put this not leae than two years later, and he will have got an approximaoe date. Franke
’ puts it in A.o.c. 729 or 730.

ARGUMENT.

Yon ahall have some poor Sabine, Maecenas, bottled at that time when the eehoee of the

. Vnam roeounded your praisoe. You drink Caecuban and Calenian, but the vines of
Falernum and Formiae are not for me.

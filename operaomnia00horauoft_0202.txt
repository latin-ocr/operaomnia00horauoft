HORATII FLAOOI

Cerberus, quamvis furiale centum

Muniant angues caput ejus atque

Spiritus teter saniesque manet
Ore trilingui.

Quin et Ixion Tityosque voltu

Risit invito, stetit urna paullum

Sicca dum grato Danai puellas
Carmine mulces.

Audiat Lyde scelus atque notas

Virginum poenas et inane lymphae

Dolium fundo pereuntis imo,
Seraque fata ‚

Quae manent culpas etiam sub Orco.
Impiae‚—nam quid potuere majus 3—

Impiae sponsos potuere duro
Perdere ferro !

Una de multis face nuptiali

Digna perjurum fuit in parentem

Splendide mendax et in omne virgo
Nobilis aevum, ξ

Surge, quae dixit juveni marito,

Surge, ne longus tibi somnus unde

Non times detur; socerum et scelestas

Falle sorores,

17. Cerberus, quamvie] A number of
German scholars (Orelli names ten, among
whom is Buttmann) have rejected this stanza
as spurious, the description being considered
tame, and the second verse in particular un-
worthy of Horace. This way of arguing
overthrows all authority,and makes genuine-
ness a matter of taste and opinion. Allow
that the stanza is none of the best. 1 do
not think the ode itseli¹ edual to many others.
Certainly more than 0110 verse is prosaic and
feeble, judged by Horace’s usual standard,
and the length of the ode on such a subject
seems to me a defect, though the scene at
the end 18 pleasing. But others may think
differently, and if all thought alike the ode
would still be Horaoe's. Bentley would
mend ¹ ejus atque‚’ which especially offenda
him, and is, as any 0110 may see, not very
harmonious or strong, by substituting ⁴ ex-
eatque‚' which some may think better and
others worse 3 but there is no reason to sup·
pose this reading had any existence till
Bentley invented it; and, although

halitus exit
Ore niger Stygio,”

occurs in Ovid (Met. iii. 75), ‘ spiritus exit'
is only used to signify the breath taking
leave of the body, which Bentley himself
peroeiving confessas he wishes Horace hul

pared withc. ii. 13. 33, sqq. Againat those
who obj eet to‘ ejus' 18 aptly quoted 8 stin
less poetical line of Virgil’ 8, the auflienticity
of which no 0110 doubts any more than ita

passage‘ ‘possum’ occurs withthesame kind

The Blandinian are in favour of‘ divusss and

allOrelli’ s, except that three have‘ a' super-
scribed.1 think‘ divusne’ is the true read-
ing, and that‘ Davus' arose out of v. 237.
“Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et au-
dax Pythias. '¹ ‘Deus’ and ‘heros’ are
brought together below (v. 227): “Ne qui-
cunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur herosss’
Orelli aptly quotes a passage of Plutarch,
from which it would seem 85 if this anti-
thesis were in a measure proverbial (Com-
paratio Aristophanis et Menandri, i. 6). -
ὥσπερ ἀπο Κλήρθ U ἁπθνέμξι ΤΟῙς προσ-
ὠποις τὰ προστυχόντα τῶν ὀνομάτων, καὶ
οὐκ ἂν διαγνοίης, ure υἱός ἐστιν, εἴτε πα-
τήρ, ur' ἄγροικος, εἶτε θεὸς, εἴτε γραῦς,
εἴτε ἥρω ς, ὁ διαλεγόμενος.

116. matrona potens] This epithet seems
to 11870 the same memiing as its kindred
word πότνια, 50 common in Homer and
the Tragedians. The officious nurse has
always been a favourite character on the
stage. We find it in Aeschylus (Choephorae),
in Sophocles (Trachiniae), and Euripides
(Hippolytus). We are all sufficiently fami-
liar with it in Shakspeare’s Romeo and
J uliet. Iu Euripides’ play and Shakspeare’s
they bear in one respect much the same
character. An ἔμπορος (⁴ mercator ') is in-
troduced in the Philoctetes of Sophocles,
and the prologue of the Electra (Euripides)
aestimasse& &saniz-¹213}
of the barbarous tribes on the shores of the
Euxine, and the Assyrian for any of the
Eastern nations. (See C. i. 2. 21, n., and
C. 11.11. 16, 11.) The opposition between
Thebes and Argos has reference partly per-
haps to Aeschylus' play, Sept. c. Thebas,
in which Polynices comes with an Argive
army to get possession of the crown of
Thebes, or to the Supplices of Euripides,
which turns on the burial of the seven lead-
ers who formed that expedition. But Ho-
race may have had in mind many other

plays of which the scene lay either at Argos
or Thebes, in connexion with Oedipus, the
quarrel of, 1115 50115, the expedition of the
Epigoni, &c.

theton ornans, corresponding to Homer's
κλυτός, &c. ‘Reponis' means ‘put upon
the stage again! The word is used in 8
different sense v.1902 “Fabula quae posci-
vult et spectata reponi.”

122. nihil non arroqet amia] ‘Lot him

make arms his one a ppeal.

123. flebilis 1110,] There ue several
fragments remaining of a play by Euripides
bearing the name of 1110, the d of
05(1111115,811(1 wife of Δ111511185,.17110 thr-ew

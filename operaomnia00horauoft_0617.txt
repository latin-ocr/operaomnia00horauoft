EPISTOLARUM Ι. 7.

Qumoun dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,

Sextilem totum mendax desideror.

Atqui

Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,

Quam mihi das aegro dabis aegrotare timenti,

Maecenas, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque 5
Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

'Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,

officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis

Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

lo

Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget3 te, dulcis amice, reviset
Gum ZephyriS, si concedes, et hirundine prima.
Non quo more piris vesci Calaber jubet hospes

Tu me fecisti locupletem.

who arranged thed prooessiou at the funeral
ot any importautperson person, and the‘ lictores’
wne his attendants who kept order (see S.
i. 64³). 1 do not imagine that ⁴ lictoribus
atria ’ means any thing here but the common
attmdants of the undertaker; but it would
seem that the ‘lictores’ and other officers
who attended on the magistrates were
sometimes appointed to attend the ‘de-

r' on thoee occasions. Cicero (de
lagg. ii. 24. 61), referring to the XII.
Tables, sa ys,‘ ‘Reliqua' m more sunt ‚ funus
ut indicatur, si quid ludorum3 dominusque
funeris utatur accenso aut lictoribus.” The
⁸ dominus funeris· here was the ‘ ‘ludgunum’
which name belonged also to the person
who put people of rank in their places at
ὡς theatro. See Plautus (Poenul. Ptol.

8. officiosaque sedulitas] That is at-
tending upon great people, and so forth.
It does not seem as if the diminutive form .

‘opella ’ had any particular force. Horace
uses diminutives when it suits the memure.

10. Quodsi bruma aives Albanis] ‘ Si '

even it' it be not hypothetical, when any
actic3u depends upon that event, as (S. ii.

and elsewhere3 so that it becomes nearly
equivalent to ‘cum.’ He says as soon as
the snow begins to lie on the Alban hilis he

shall go down to the sea, whether to Taren-

tum, as Torrentius and Lambinus suggest,

14. calaber jubet harpen} The man is
made a Calabrian only to give the story
more point, not I think as Orelli says be-
cause the Calabrians were ‘⁴ politioris vitae
ignari '’ The qnoetion is not one of refincd
manners, but of genuine or falseh
and the former dooe not belong exclusively
to conventional refinement, which is rather
apt to corrupt it. The guest is polite enough,
and heis a Calabrian too.

Quamvis nil extra numerum secisse modumque

Cusas, interdum nugaris rure paterno ;

Partitur lintres exercitus; Actia pugna
Te duce per pueros hostili more refertur 3
Adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec
Alterutrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.

Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te,

Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.
Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tu,
Quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe videto.
Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,

Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures,

Non 81101118 tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae

Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat.

though Horace does not mean to say he is
given to 080855 81111 wasting his time on

whom the estates of the elder Lollius lay,
or who was 1115 other son, is not known.
The two brothers, it appears, got up a
representation of the battle of Actium on a
pond perhaps 111 their father's grounds, and
they made the slavos (⁸ pueros ’) act the
soldiers and sailors, while they took the
principal characters themselves, the elder
acting Augustus, and his brother M. An-
tonius.

64. velox Victor-'afronde coronet] Vic-
toria 15 always represented as a young fe-
male with wings, and with a palm—branch
or a wreath in her hand, or both, as in a
medal of Galba in Oiselius’ Thes. lxviii. 2.
Orelli mentions one ease iu which she is
represented without wings, but perhaps the
figure has been mistaken. Gellius (vi. 6),

discussingtheuseof‘ praepetes' as anad-
jective for‘ pennae, 'quotes from Mattius’

Iliad the line‘ ‘Dum det vincenti praepes
Victoria am.” Victoria had 8 temple
at the foot of the western slope of Mons
Palatinus, on the site of the house erected
by Valerius Poplicola. Livy (ii. 7) 08115 it
“Vicaepotae aedes,'' a name compounded
of ‘vinc-o' and ‘pot-ior! Her statues
Fere numerous. See in particular Livy
8811. 23).

66. Fautor utroque—pollice] Iu the
fights of gladiators the people expressed

their approbatiou by turning their thumbs
down, and the reverse by upliffing them.
When a gladiator had got his adversary .
down or disarmed him, he looked to the
spectators for this signal, and according as
the thumb was up or down he despatched
or spared the man. Ι suppose he took his
orders, or the mass of the spectators took
their lead, from the personages who sat
near the ‘ podium.' (Epp. i. 1. 6, n.) Thus
‘ fautor utroque pollice ' is a proverbial way
of speaking, as Pliny says (xxviii. 2): ¹‘ Pol-
licae 011111 faveamus premere etiam proverbio
jubemur.'' See Juvenal (iii. 36):

“Munera nunc edunt et verso pollice

auga-lgffis'et occidunt populariter ;''

on which passage Ruperti says the thumb

fallen man was to be run through there.

takae it with Porphyrion, from‘ quis, 'with
the conjunction. The Scholiast says: “Tria
dicit: quid 111085, 110 quo dicas, et cui dicas?

‘’Percontator is a gossip who is always

asking questions in order to retail the
answers, generally in 8 perverted form.
His ears are always open to pick up remarks
(‘ patulae '), and his tongue always active to
repeat them.

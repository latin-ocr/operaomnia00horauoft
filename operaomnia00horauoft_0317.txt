Non defuisse masculae libidinis

Ariminensem Foliam

Et otiosa credidit Neapolis
Et omne vicinum oppidum,

Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala

Lunamque caelo deripit.
Hic irresectum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem
Quid dixit aut quid tacuit? O rebus meis

Non infideles arbitrae‚

Arcana cum fiunt sacra,
N unc, nune adeste, nune in hostiles domos

Iram atque numen vertite ἔ

Formidolosis dum latent silvis ferae

Dulei sopore languidae,

Senem, quod omnae rideant, adulterum
Latrent Suburanae canes

Nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius

Meae laborarint manus.—

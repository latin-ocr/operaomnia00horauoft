ARGUMENT.

'rho vulne of a moderate fere come learn froin me (on the authority of the phin sensible
menn), not with the giitter of plato in your eyes, but now, before you heve broken
your fut. He who would judge truly must heve an unbinoeed judgment.

(v. 9.) Go, get up your appetite with hunting or bell-phy or the qnoit, end then see whether
you will despise humble fue md reject the drink that is not mingled with Hymet-fian -
honey. If the butler is ubroad end no fish is to be had, your belly will be content with
drybreudend salt. How isthis? Why the plensure of euting does not lie in the
suvour of the meat, but in yourself. Let labour supply you with mee. Τὴθ most
ternpting daintioe give no pleesure to the bloated stomach. Yet scnrce any argument
willjnevent your preferring a peecoek to a bern-door ἰωή, merely because it hus a fine
nil, und costs more money. How cen you tell where that fish m caught? You
dungh* in u mullet of three pounde weight, und yet you must cut it into fragments to
serve it to your friends. But why then don't you like the big lupus? Why, because
um one is big by nature, the other small, and you like what is unnatursl sud rure. The
hungry belly, on the other hund, seldom despises s thing because it is common. “ 1
like to see a hnge beust sti-etched out on a huge dish,'' suys the glutton- Blow south
winde aud rot theirhduinties! But let them alone, they are es good us rotten already
for appefitoe that want rather stimulants than food. But these luxuries ure only of
late growth, and some day we shall hove rooet gulls in fmhion.

(v. 53.) But moden-atina is not meenness, und it is of no use ιο avoid one fault only ιο
fill into another. Avidienus puts old fruit and sour wine before his friends, und is
stingy of his stinking oil, even on holidsys. Which would you rather imitate? Re·
spectubility lies in a middle course, avoiding excoesive strietness, but equally avoiding u
slovenly carelessness.

(v. 70.) Now 1 will tell you the advantagoe of moderate fare. In the first plaoe it con-
duces to heulth, as you cun easily teu, if you think how well your food agreed with you
tm you mixed up all manner of things in your stomach- How pule a mun gets up from
ι mixed supper! Iaet the belly be oppraesed with debuuch and the soul is oppressed
likewise. Another man takes s hearty supper, goes to bed early, and gets up equnl to
theduties of the day3 and he, if a holiday comes round or sickness or age requires
extrnindulgenee, may indulge himself with impunity: but whnt cen you add to the
indulgence you nntidpete in your early days? Our moenum, bent on hospitulity, kept

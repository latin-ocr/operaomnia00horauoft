CARMINUM IV. 15. 257

Te non paventis funera Galliae
Duraeque tellus audit Hiberiae, 50
Te caede gaudentes Sigambri
Compositis venerantur armis.

CARMEN XV.

A.U.C. 741.

This ode appears in early times to have been read ss port of the fourteenth. The
Soholinst Porphyrion says, ‘⁴ Quidam separant hmo oden a superiore, sed potest illi jungi
quonism hic laudea dicuntur Augusti.” This is ιι poor resson, und there eun be little
doubt the odes were written sepmtely, though probably about the seme time, on the
return of Augustus to Rome, A.u.c. 741. In consequence of the mention made in v. 9 of
the closing of the temple of anus, u later date is assigned to the ode, nomely‚ ΔΑΜ). 745,
when it infir-med (but without sufficient resson, ss anke has shown) that the temple was
dosed,fortliethir·d lime during thelife of Augustus. Butos ithaci been closed twice
before and Ποῖ-ιω does not specify the particular time, bnt merely affirma what might have
boon nid with eqml truth my yesr oster 725. this argument proves nothing. If we may
assume, a· has been assumed throughout this book, that it was published, as Suetonius
says, for the sake of the odes in honour of Augustus’ step-sons, thenit is highly improbable
that the publication was delsyed sor fom- yenrs, and there is nothing in this ode which
might not have been written on his return, but much reason to suppose it was. All that
is here said of the subjection of the world and the universal peace was said in effect at the
doseof the fourteenth od03 but it was natural that, if Horace had received the emperor's
eommnnds to publish another book of odes, he should conclude it with one addressed
to Augustus himself, reviewing the blessings of his reign which st this time had been
crowned by a series of successes by which universal peace was established.

HORATII FLAOOI

Non sola comptos arsit adulteri
Crines, et aurum vestibus illitum

Mirata regalesque cultus

Et comites Helene Lacaena,
Primusve Teucer tela Cydonio
Direxit arcu 3 non semel Ilios

Vexata3 non pugnavit ingens

Idomeneus Sthenelusve solus
Dicenda Musis proelia ;

non ferox

Hector vel acer Deiphobus graves
Excepit ictus pro pudicis
Oonjugibus puerisque primus.

Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona

Multi ; sed omnes illacrumabiles
Urgentur ignotique longa
Nocte, carent quia vate sacrO.
Paullum sepultae distat inertiae

Celata virtus.

Non ego te meis

Chartis inornatum silebo,
Totve tuos patiar labores

13. ars-it] This governs ¹ crines ³ as
‘mirata' governs the other accusatives.
See C. ii. 4. 7, ιι. I do not see much
force in DiUenbr.’s distinction. He says
‘ardere ' being equivalent to ‘ ardenter
amare ' has an accusative as in Virg. Ecl.
ii. l, and adds, ‘⁴ ablativus indicat unde venit
ardor.'' Laodamia writes thus to her hus·

band of the charms by which Helen was.

“ Venerat (Paris) ut fama est multo specta-
Qdibliisealgib’ Phrygias corpore ferret
His tegga-:te—victam, consors Ledaea, ge-
Sugp‘ilcldi’g haec Danais posse nocere

and Hecuba upbraids Helen with the same
weakness (Eur. Tro. 987) :—

ἦν οὑμὸς υἷος κάλλος ἐκπρεπέστατος,

ὀ σὸς δ’ ἰδών νιν νοῦς ἐποιήθη Κύπρις·

ὅν γ’ εἰσιδοῦσα βαρβάροις ἐσθήμασι
χρυσῷ τε λαμπρὸν ἐξεμαργώθης φρένας.

17. tela Cydonio] Teucer is described
by Homer as ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν τοξοσύνῃ
(Il. xiii. 313). Cydon was a town of Crete,
and the Cretans were famous archers.

Compare Virg. Ecl. x. 59 : ‘⁸
donia cornu Spicula.''

27. Uryentur] So C. i. 24. 5: “Ergo
Quintilium perpetuus sopor Urget ?⁷’ ‘Il-
lacrumabilis ’ is used in an active sense
C. ii. 14. 6. The idea eomes from Pindar
(Nem. vii. 12, sqq.:) —

Torquere Cy-

 

ιιὶ μεγάλαι γὰρ ἄλκαι

29. Paullum pepultae] Virtue if it be
left in obscurity' is in no better position than
dulness (which signifies generally a gross
unspiritual nature) when that too is buried;
one is on a par with the other as far as in-
fluence is concerned, for neither exercises
any influence at all; and as far as his repu-
tation goes a man may as well bebpried in
stupidity as have his virtues buried in
oblivion. ‘⁵ A man that hideth his foolish-
ness is better than a man that hideth his
wisdom.” These words of the son of Sirach
(Eccl. xli. 15) have some resemblance to
Horace's, and I have seen them quoted
together, though 1 do not remember where.
But the sentiment is not the same. Any
English reader will remember Gray's lines
in his Church- yard Elegy that cor-respond
most closely to Horace’ s. Bentley has
furnished work for the critice by objecting
to the common reading and proposing‘ in-

14. et principe Caesare] Scaliger pro- tell on what MSS. or editions tho Dutch
posed the omission of ⁶ et,’ and some editors editor depended, or whether his omission
have followed him, understanding Horace to of ‘ et ’ may not have been a slip or con-
mean ‘ because Caesar is prince.’ ΤΙιε con- jecture of his own. The conjunction here
junction is stated by Kirchner (Nov. Qu. p. is in accordance with a practice very com-
57, n.) to be wanting in an old edition by a mon with Horace, of coupling a general and
Dutchman, Peter Von Os,which he considam a particular object, of which Dillenhr. has
sufficient authority. It often happens that collected a great many instances, on C. i. 3.
when commentators get an edition to which 19 :—
others have not access they give it undue “mare turgidum et
weight from its rarity. Kirchner cannot Infames scopulos Aoeocerannia.'’

CARMEN XXII.

A.U.c. 729 (Ξ). See note on v. 15.

Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace's, and the wag whom he represents
as playing him false in his interview with the troublesome fellow he met on the Sacra
Via (S. i. 9. 61). Horace and he were

 

‘⁴ paene gemelli,

Fraternis animis; quicquid negat alter, et albex-3

Adnuimus pariter-3 vetuli notique columbi'' (Epp. i. lo).
We know nothing more of him except from the statements of the Scholiasta, who make
out that he was a writer of tragedies3 another says of comedies, and all that he was a

grammarian. It has also been doubted (from the confused statements of the Scholiasta) ⁴ Δ,

whether Horace is not the person meant S. i. 9. 22, which runs in all the MSS„-

“ Si bene me novi non Viscum pluris amicum

Non Varium facies.”
It is impossible to determine the date of the ode. We can only say that it was written ,
after Horace had got his country-house, that is, not earlier than A.u.c. 722. J
Fuscus, as usual, has not much to do with the ode, his name being bon-owed as that Α
of Sestius (C. 4) and others, and for the same purpose. Α

ARGUMENT.
An honest man, Fuscus, may go unarmed along the burning shores of Africa, over the

wild Caucasus or to the fabulous East. 'Twas there, as Ῑ wandercd careless in the Δ

woods singing of my Lalage, a wolf such as Apulia and Africa rear not met meand ssed.
Set me in the cold and stormy north, or in the buming and uninhabited tropic, still ’

will I love my smiling, prattling Lalage.

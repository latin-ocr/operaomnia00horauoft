both heat and cold. See Epp. i. 8. 5,
‘⁴ oleamque momorderit aestum? ⁴ Rimosa’
is intelligible enough. But it does not oc-
cur in any such sense elsewhere. Comm.
Cruq. compares it with ‘ patula ’ in Epp. i.
18. 70, “Nec retinent patulae commissa
fideliter aures,'' and says the expression is
taken from that of Terence (Eun. i. 2.

“Sin falsum audierim ac fictum continuo
Plentliffnffmffrhm sum, hac atque illac
perfluo.’'

48. nostem] This is a familiar way of
expressing ‘ myselfi' Plautus has it in
several places. See for one Epid. 1. 2. 45,
‘⁴ Novi ego nostros; mihi dolet, cum ego
vapulo.” The editions till Bentley all seem
to have had a stop after ‘ invidiae,’ joining
⁴ noster' with ⁴speetaverat,‘ which leaves
the first sentence too bare and elliptical.
⁴ Spectaverat’ and ‘ luserat’ are the reod-
ings it appears of the best MSS. There is
very little authority for ‘spectaverit‚' and
only one MS. that Bentley can produce has
‘laser-it! The subjunctive is more usual,
as in S. i. l. 45, where this hypothetical
construction is discussed, but the indicative
occurs below, S. 7. 68. ‘Luserat' refers
to ball- play. ‘Fortunae filius ' was a oon-
ventional phrase* Sophocles uses it (Oed.
Tyr. 1080), ἐγὼ δ’ ἐμαυτὸν παῖδα τῆς
”aggf ἔῗιιζᾳτέἑω a Rostris] Suppose some

bad news has been publinhed in tho Fon-um
and got abroad in the streets. The ‘ rocha?
which Niebuhr (i. 406, n.) describes ns ‘⁶ a
stage of considerable length, with steps at
each end of it, lying in the line between the
temple of Castor and the Curia Hostilia?
originally separated the comitium where the
patriciana met from the epm where the
plebeian- assemblies were held, which was
properly the Forum, though that name was
popularly applied to the whole. Julius
Caesar removed the ‘ rostra ' to a corner of
the Forum under the Mons Palatinus, und.
the building heerected was called aster him.
Here persons of all ranks met, und from
this centro reporta would naturally take
their rise, and then get disseminated in the
city. The ‘rostra ' had its plural nmo
from the beaks of vessels taken from the
people of Antium (Liv. viii. u), with
which the stage was ornamented. Aa to

the‘ compitass see note on S. ii. 3. 25. ’

53. Dacis] See Introduction.

55. Triquetra] See Introduction. This
is the ablative. ‘ Triquetra’ significa tri-
{effi 32. M... fex: Μ’,εξ

i y, ca riunena, m ι
promontories. Caesar describoe Britain also
as‘ ‘insulan-iq uetra’ (’Β. G. v. 13). Homer’s
Θρινακίῃ νῆσος (odyss. xii. 127) isusually
supposed to be the same word as Trinacria.
But this may be doubted.

57. unum Scilicet— mortalem] Tho
Greeks use εἷς ἀνὴρ in this way to express
a superlative.

262 HORATII FLAGGI

reference to the great Platonic year, which, when complete, is to bring an the heavenly
bodies back to their original relative places. 'rhat the Magnus Annus was generally
believed in is certain. Virgil refers to it in his fourth Eclogue: ‘⁴ Magnus ab integro
saeclorum nascitur ordo ” (v. 5), ‘⁴ incipient magni procedere menses ¹’ (v. 12). Cicero
discusses it in his treatise de Nat. Deorum (ii. 20): ‘⁸ Quarum (i. e. of the planeta) ex
disparibus motionibus magnum annum mathematici nominaverunt3 qui tum efficitur
quum solis et lunae et quinque errantium ad eandem inter se comparationem, confectis
omnium spatiis, est facta conversio. Quae quam longa sit magna quaestio est. Essevero
certam et definitam necesse aetss’ The statements of the ancients vary from 49,000 to
nearly 26,000 years. The last corresponds to the period calculated for the precession of the
equinoxes, with which, however, the Magnus Annus of the Greeks and Romans had nothing
to do. It is represented on the reverse of a medal of Hadrian in the form of a man in a
loose robe, with a globe and Phoenix in his lest hand, and his right raised over his head.
He is surrounded by an oval ring to distinguish him from the figures of Eternity, repre-
sented in a circle. The inscription is Saeculum Aureum. What amount of credit is due
to all the details of J ahn’s explanation, which are derived chiefly from the mtements of
Servius on the 4th Eclogue of Virgil and from Censorinus, Ι cannot say. But, without
resorting to such explanations as the above, it would have been very surprising if
Augustus, having resolved to celebrate a great festival in honour of his own succeoeful
career, had not made Apollo the principal feature of it, and had called upon Pluto to
bless his country, in preference to that god to whom he allowed himself to be likened
and whom his flatterers assigned to him as his father. Horace appears to have been
much pleased at being chosen as poet-laureate of the occasion (see C. iv, 6, Introd.).
The ode was sung at the most solemn part of the festival, while the emperor was in par-
son offer-ing sacrifice at the second hour of the night on the river side upon three nitus,
attended by the fisteen men who presided over religious affairs. ΤῙιο chorus consisted of
twenty-seven boys and twenty-seven girls of noble birth, well trained no doubt for the
occasion (C. iv. 6). The effect must have been very beautiful, and no wonder if the
impression on Horace’s feelings (for in all probability he was present) was strong and
lasting. Attempts have been made to distinguish the parts migned to the respective
chorusae. But there do not appear tome to be any conclusive or very probablo data on
which to found an accurate division, in which therefore, as might be expected, the editur-
do not agree. Ι have endeavoured in the argument to show all the divisione of the ode hy
its subjects. In judging of the character of the ode as a poetica-l composition, it munt not
be forgotten that it was written for a peculiar and solemn occasion and to be set to music,
in both which points it differs from most of the other odes of Horace3 and, judged with
reference to those objects, it may be pronounced superior to laureate odes in general. For
rhythm it appears to me the best of all the Sapphic odes.

sse perusal of this introduction and the following argument, of the Sibyllino verses
(the instructions of which are closely followed), and of the description from Zosimus
above referred to, will save the necessity for so long a commentar-5 as would otherwise be

necessary.

ARGUMENT.

Apollo and Diana, hear the prayers we offer you in obedience to the Sibyl’s commanda
(1-8).

O sunthat rulest the day, thou lookest upon nothing mightier than Rome (9—12).

Ilithyia, protect our mothers and their children, and prosper our marriage law, that so in
the cycle of years this our festival may come again (13-24).

And ye, Parcae, who do prophesy truly, let our future fates be as the past. Let the
earth and air give strength to our flocks and fruita (25—32).

1. Ambubaiarum eolleqiffl The reduc-
tion οἰ Syria to the condition of a Roman
province (ΛΑΜ). 689), while it opened ω
the Romans the unde of the East, was the
meana of introducing into Italy many evils
from the same quartem among others, the
class of women known by the above name,
of whom Acron and Comm. Cruq. say that
they were so called in the Syrian lang-uage,
from an instrument of music they played
upon: ‘⁴ etenim lingna eorum tibia sive
symphonia ambubaia diciturl’ These wo-
men, whose profession was that of prosti-
tntes, Horace speaks of jomlarly as if they
had formed themselves into collegoe or
dubo such asat this time were very common
in Rome, some mactioned by law, others
not. (See art. ⁴ Collegium,' in Smith’s Dict.
Ant.) Juvenal refers to these women in
his third Satire (v. 62, sqq.):

“Jam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit

pharmacopolae,] These were itinerant
deniers in nostrums and vendors of medi-
cines, who were to be seen in the forum
and all places of public resort. They do
not appear to have got much custom.
M. Cato, in his speech against M. Caelius,
inveighs against him as an inveterate talker,
and says he was so greedy of speech that he
would hire people to listen to him; and
that you rather heard than listened to the
man, likea‘ pharmacopola' who could make
his voice heard, but no siek person ever
thought of putting himself into his hands.
(Gellius, N. P.A i. 15). Cicero (pro Cluent.
14) makes mention of one L. Clodius, of
Anema, who practised this trade. Such
persons may now be seen in the streets of
Pariswithacart and horse and a manto
make music. They will stop at fit places,

make their music or their speech, give ad-

vice, hand out pills and other medicines,
receive their money, and move on.

2. Mendici.] This word includes beggars
of all sorta, of whom a great variety ap-
peared as religious mendicants. priests for
instance of Isis οι· of Cybele (known by the
Greeks under the title of μητραγύρται) and
Jews, who made gain of their law, inventing
charms perhaps from it, and persuading the
soolish to purchase phylacteries. Juvenal
mentions this class of beggars in his sixth
Satire (v, 543, sq.): “Arcanam Judaea
tremens mendicat in aurem Interpres legum
Solymamm.” There were also fortune-
tellers in abundance all over the town. See
C. i. 11, Introd. Street musieians were as
common and as discordant at Rome as
among ourselves. Of jngglers likewise
there were swarms, and many other sorts of
impostors.

pantomimic parts were sustained also by
women. Horace mentions one of this class
named Arbuscula (S. i. 10. 76), who was a
celebrated ‘mima' in Cicero’s time (Ad
Att. iv. 15, written asne. 700): “quaeris
nune de Arbuscula. Valde placuit. Ludi
magnifici et grati.’' As might be expected,
they were persons of loose character, as
the woman Origo mentioned below (v. 55),
and the before-mentioned Arbuscula, and
the woman Cytheris, whom M. Antonius
carried about with him under the name of
Volumnia (Cic. ad Att. x. 103 Phil. ii. 24).

balatroneefl The meaning and etymology
of this word are hopelessly lost. Cruquius’
Scholiast gives three different derivafionsg
from Servilius Balatro (mentioned S. ii.
8. 21), who, as Forcellini observes, more
probably got his name from the species
than the species from him, ‘a balatm' from
an affected ridiculous way of
which is against prosody3 ‘a blatiendol
from their senseless babble; and some he
says read ‘barathrones,'as from‘ barathrum:
because they were gluttonous livera who de-
voured their substance, according to Ho-

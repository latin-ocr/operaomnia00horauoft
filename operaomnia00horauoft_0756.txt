Pieriis tentata modis ; ludusque repertus

HORATII FLAOOI

.405

Et longorum operum finis: ne forte pudori

Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo.
Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte
Quaesitum est: ego nec studium sine divite vena

Nec rude quid possit video ingenium3 alterius sic

410

Altera poscit opem res et conjurat amice.
Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam
Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit,
Abstinuit venere et vino; qui Pythia cantat

Tibicen didicit prius extimuitque magistrum.

415

Nec satis est dixisse: “ Ego mira poemata pango;
Occupet extremum scabies ; mihi turpe relinqui est
Et quod non didici sane nescire fateri.''

Ut praeco, ad merces turbam qui cogit emendas,

Assentatores jubet ad lucrum ire poeta

405. Pieriis tentata modin] ΤΙιε coun-
try of Pieria lay between Macedonia and
Thessalia, north of the range of Olympus,
and on the coast of the Sinus Thermaicus.
This accounts for the Muses being both
Pierian and Olympian. Miiuer (p. 27) says
that the Pierians lived up to the time of the
Doric and Aeolic migrations in Boeotia and
Phocis, near the mountain tanges of Heli-
con in the former and Parnassus in the lat-
ter. Whence he supposes that to the Pie-
rians is to be traced the origin of Greek
poetry, and that to this is to be attributed
the association of the Muses with Helicon
and Parnassus. He thus also accounts for
the traditions which assigned the birth of
poetry to bards of Thrace (v. 400, n.), a
country of which the language was pro-
nounced barbarous by the civilized Greeks:
for “when the Pierians were pressed in their
own territory by the early Macedonian
princes, some of them crossed the Strymon
into Thrace proper’' (Herod. vii. 112). “It
is however quite conceivable (Miiller adds,
and perhaps he had better have been con-
tent with this) that in early times, on ac-
count of their close vicinity, or because all
the north was comprehended under one
name, the Pierians might in Southern
Greece have been called Thracians. These
Pierians, from the intellectual relations
which they maintained with the Greeks,
appear to be a Grecian race; which sup-
position is also confirmed by the Greek
names of their places, rivers, fountains,

420

&c.’' Fui-ther observatiam will be found in
the same work showing the probable con-
nexion between these Pierians and the Epic
poetry of Homer. .

406. Et lonqorum operum finisx] The
rural Dionysia (v. 275, n.), called τὰ κατ’
ἀγροὺς or τὰ μικρὰ, took place at the eud
os the year, in the mouth Ποσειδέων, when
the labours of the vintage were over.

408. Natura fieret laudabile] See v.
295, n.

413. Multa tulit fecitque putem] ‘He
takes great pains when he is young: ⁴ μετ’
being emphatic, as in C. i. 9. 16.

414. qui Pythia cantat micea] At
the Pythian gamen there was a musical con-
test in which fiute-players and harp-players
took part, the subject being the contest of
Apollo with the serpent Pytho. The name
given to this music was νόμος Πυθικός.

416. Nec satis est davisse .·] All the
editions till Bentley have ‘ nunc.' He
edited ‘nec' tlt-om two MSS„ which have
since been confirmed by others, and among
them by Orelli’s St.. Gallen. Ι prefer ‘ nec,’
though the Scholiasts certainly had ⁴ nunc,’
and that has most authority. Comm-
Cruq. explains it “ Satis est nostris poffis
ut dicant,’' which must be the meaningif
⁴ nunc ' is retained. ᾗ

417. Occupet extremum scabiem] The
Scholiasts say this expression was used by
boys in their races-

419. Ut procem] See S. i. 6. 86, n.

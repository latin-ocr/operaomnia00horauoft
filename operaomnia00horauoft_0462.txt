HORATII FLAOOI

Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentes
Quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit
Versiculos natura magis factos et euntes
Mollius ac si quis pedibus quid claudere senis,

Hoc tantum contentus, amet scripsisse ducentos

60

Ante cibum versus, totidem coenatus3 Etrusci
Quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni
Ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque

Ambustum propriis. ²

Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,
Comis et urbanus, fuerit limatior idem

Quam rudis et Graecis intacti carminis auctor,

fair spirit of criticism the poets that have
gone before him.

59. ac si quis] 1 do not know why
Orelh' limits this use of ‘ ac ' after words of
compar-ison to the poetS. It is not less em-
ployed iu prose. (See S. l. 46, u.) Horace
says he is at liberty to inquire whether it is
not a natural consequence of Lucilius’ tem-
perament, and the character of his subjecte,
that he wrote verses not more polished and
smooth than might be expected of a man who
was content with giving his lines the proper
number of feet, and took delight in string-
ing together a vast number of them in the
shortest possible time. ⁴ Pedibus quid elau-
dere senis ' I understand to explain ⁴ hoc‚’
contented merely with this, that is to say,
comprising something (that he calls a verse,
for there is contempt in ‘ quid ’) in six feet.
Bentley puts ⁸ hoc tantum' in a parenthesis,
which is nnnecessary. ¹ At,' which is the
reading of some of the old editions and of
Lambinus, and ⁴ an ' the conjecture of
Dacier and Doering, are bad substitutes for
‘ ac‚' and give no sense that I can understand.

61. Etrusci Quale suit Cassi] Of this
Cassius we know nothing, and what Horace
says of him is no more than a jocular inven-
tion that his writings were of so little value
that they were burnt on the same funeral pile
with his body, or, as he seems to menn, that
there was enough of them to form a funeral
pile of themselves. The Scholiasts all con-
found him with Cassius of Parma mentioned
Epp. i. 4. 3, where see note: and many edi-
tors follow them, forgetting that Parma was
not an Etrurian town, but belonged to the
Boii in Cisalpine Gaul. Bentley again
‘¹ sua vineta caedit ’' (see C. iv. 12, Int.), for
Cassius of Parma was put to death by order
of Augustus after the battle of Actium (in
which he took part with M. Antonius),
i. e. in A.U.c. 7233 whereas Bentley sup-

poses in his chronological scheme that the
first book of the Satires was finished in A.u.c.
717. Acron says his books were burnt with
his body, by order of the senatu eonfound-
ing him with Cassius Severus (mentioued
on Epod. vi., Int.), iu κῶμοι to whom wo
read in Suetonius (Calig. c. 16) that such a
decree was passed. Iu this confusion of
names we only see that the Scholiast-
knew nothing about the Etrurian caedua,
and it is useless for ns to attempt to leam Α
more of him than that he was in Hmce's
οῑίιίιιὶοιῖ1 a ρρὲεἰωιῖιῦρῐ that low class of poete
w om e is esen mg.

63. capsis] SeeS. 4. 22, n.

64. Fuerit] SeeS. i.1. 45.

66. Quam rudit et Graecia] Allowthat
heis more polished thau as the inventor of
a new style of writing unknown to the
Greeks he appears to be, and than the mass ,
of the older poets certainly are. What
Horace means to say is, that Lucilius, stom
the novelty of his style, may possibly be
judged unfairly, and may possess more
beauties and even elegancies than are al-
lowed him3 but sfill there con be no doubt.
if he had lived to that time, be would have
corrected many expressions and gone to a
good deal of trouble in poliihing his veram.
The commentatore have given avan-iety' of
interpuetations from the Scholiasts down-
wards, which Orelli has collected. The
above appears to be the true one. It
agrees with Heindorf's explanation, und is
the substance of a paper on the subject by
C. F. Hermann, which Orelli quotes with
approbation. The MSS. and editions vary
between ⁴ dilatus ' and ‘ delatus,’ ‘ dilapsus '
and ⁴ delapsus! The first is more generally
adopted. It means properly ⁴ desan-ed:
had his birth been put off till now. ⁴ De-
latus’ would mean, had his life been con·
tinued, brought down to the present fimo.

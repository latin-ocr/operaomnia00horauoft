INTACTIS opulentior

HORATII FLAOOI

Thesauris Arabum et divitis Indiae

Gaementis licet occupes

Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulicum‚

Si figit adamantinos

Summis verticibus dira Necessitas ·
Clavos, non animum metu,

N on mortis laqueis expedies caput.
Campestres melius Scythae

Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos 10

Vivunt, et rigidi Getae

Immetata quibus jugera liberas
Fruges et Cererem ferunt,
Nec cultura placet longior annua,

Defunctumque laboribus

Aequali recreat sorte vicarius.

Illic matre carentibus

Privignis mulier temperat innocens,

Nec dotata regit virum

Conjux nec nitido fidit adultero.

l. Intactis] Cn. Pompeius, Marcellus, and
others had entered Arabia Petraea3 but
Arabia Felix which is here referred to had
not yet been invaded. The disastrous ex-
pedition under Aelius Gallus did not take
place till A.u.c. 729, which was probably
aster the composition of this ode. See C. i.
29, Int.‚ and compare Propertius (ii. 10.

15, sqq. ε
“ India q)uin, Auguste, tuo dat colla triumpho
Et domus intactae te tremit Arabiae.”

India and Arabia are again coupled Epp. i.
6. 6 : “ Quid (censes) maris extremos Ara-
bas ditantis et Indos ἓ ”

3. Caementi8 licet occupes] This is ex-
plained by C. iii. l. 35.

6. Summis verticibus] This has been
variously explained. Bentley supposes it
to mean the heads of the nails, ¹⁴ when Fate
drives 111 the nails to the heads.’' His note
on these lines is one of his worst. He
prefers ‘ dura ' to ‘ dira‚’ but does not adopt
it in his text, though he says he should not
mind doing so or care for all the MSS. and
editions put together. ‘⁴ They so generally
confound the two words,'' he says, “ that it
is remarkable they should show such a de-
praved and perverse unanimity in retaining

the worst of thern here.” Some take Horace

20

tomeanthatFate,bydrivinghe1-nails ((010-
vos trabales,’ i. 35. 18) into the roos of the
house, puts an end to the work and declares
that the master’s work is done. Such is
the meaning Orelli gives, and 110 supposes
Horace to have got the idea stom some
Greek poet. It is very obsmre. The
Scholiasta throw no light upon it. Cru-
quius' Commentator takes ⁴ verticibus ’ fer
the human head: ‘⁴ in vertice siquidem b-
cilior est ictus ad mortem viduitate esre-
bri.” I like this interpretation the beet.
12. Immetata] This is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.
Virgil assigns to the golden age this 11·οαῖοω

from enclosures 1

“ Ante J ovem—
Ne signare quidem aut partiri limite cam- .
pum

Fas erat.” (Georg. 1. 125, 6.)

‘ Liberas ⁷ means ⁴ common property.’

14. Nec cultura placet] The habits of
the Suevi as described by Caesar (Bell.
Gall. iv. 1) are here assigned to the Getae.
“They had 100 districts (pagi),'' says he,
‘¹ each of which supplied annually 1000 ool-
diers, who served a year and were then re·
lieved by others, who in their turn served a

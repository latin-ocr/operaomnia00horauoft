EPISTLE Ι.

Axona other meodooes connected with Augustus, Suetonius, in his life of Horace,
says, ‘⁴ Post Semnones quoque lectos, nullam sui mentionem habitam ita est que-tus z

i. 2⁰, init, lna this notet ‘⁴ Ex his versibus et in principio sequentis libri apparet Horatius
hoe volumen quasi novissimum totius operis habuisse. Nam secundum epistularum
ccactm adjecit ;'' and at the beginning of this Epistle he says: “ Apparet hunc librum, ut
supra diximus, hortatu Caoearis scriptum esse: cujus rei etiam Suetonius auctor est.''
'niis Scholiast’s authority therefore was probably no other than that which we possoes in
the above memoir, which as early at least as his day was attributed to Suetonius. But
there is no improbability in the story. A similar theory has been advanced in respect to,
the sixth Ode of the first book, addroesed to Agrippa, which, like this Epistle, deprecates
the usk of attempting the praisoe of a great man. Assuming the truth of Suetonius’
statmnent, we must place the date of this Epistle aster the publication of the first book.
It is generally supposed, with some probability, that the Secular Ode was in Horace's
mind when he wrote v. 132, sq. If so, the Epistle was not written till aster aasz. 737.
Beyond this there are no data at all safe for fixing the time of composition.

Horace begins by excusing himself for not having written before (supposing the truth
of the above story) by the great labours and anxieties of Augustus, on whose attention it
was not for him to intrude. He goes on to commend the discrimination of the people,
wb0, contrary to that usual practice by which great men are loaded with envy and abuse
when alive and with honours only after they are dead, had recognized Augustus' divinity
already. But having given the age that credit, he reproaches their judgment in respect to
deceased and living authors, the former of whom they commended only because they were
dead and gone, while the latter they abused through envy and spite. ' There is something
in this complaint which 00an with his censure of Lucilius and his admirers written
many years before. But Lucilius does not appear in this poem, in which the dramatic
⁷ writers are those more particularly noticed. It appears that Augustus was very partial to
these himself, and Horace probably means indirectly to remonstrate with the emperor's
taste in this matter, and to put in a plea for himself and his brethren, though that this

fore the praetor (v. 18). The digression
that intervenes is a comparison between
such disputants and the warriors of the
Iliad. When men fall out, says he, they
fight after the fashion of two brave heroes
engaged in a deadly send, even as Hector
and Achilles, who hated each other so mor-
tally, and were so exceedingly brave,'that
they could not be separated when they
came together in conflict till one or other
was killed; or else they behave as when
two cowards meet and both are glad to give
way ; or as when the strong meets the weak,
Diomed meets Glaucus, and the weak gives
in and humbles himself before his enemy.

ll. inter Hectora—atque inter Achillem]
This repetition of ‘ inter' is not uncommon.
See Cic. Lael. c. 25: “ Contio —judicare
solet quid intersit inter popularem civem,
et inter constantem, severum, et gravem.''
And Epp. i. 2. ll :—

Nestor componere lites
Inter Peliden festinat et inter Atriden.’'

 

Bentley, who does not seem to have re-
membered this passage of Cicero or Livy
(x. 7), declares this way of speaking, with
the double ‘inter,' to be “vitiosum loquendi
genus et ἰδιωτικόν, quodque magni emerim
nunquam ab Horatio prolatum.'’ In these
words he seems to admit that, vitious as the
language js, it is Horace's. But that does
not signify. He goes on to propose ‘ olim
Hectora’ here, and ‘Primus Peliden' in
the other place, declaring that the copyists‚
surprised at finding the preposition with
the latter of the two names in each case,
underlined the readings he has given with
the word ‘inter,' and so it got into the text.
It is hard to say which one should admire
most in this note of his,——its perverseness
or the want of taste shown in the correc-
tions it proposes. ‘ Animosum ’ belongs to
¹ Achillem‚' ⁴ atque ' being often put by
llorace after the first word of its clause.

minum ;” also S. i. 5. 4, 6. 131.

15. vexet] Some of Lambinus’ MSS.
had ‘ verset.’ He does not say what their
value is. Bentley and some modern editors
have adopted this reading. All the old
editions, and the great majority of MSS„
and the oldest, have ⁴ vexet’ The maeting
between Glaucus and Diomed, in which the
former loses heart and gives up his arms to
his adversary, is related in Hom. Il. vi. 234,
sqq. “ On ‘ultr0,’ see C. iv. 4, 51. n. .

18. Bruto praetore tenente] Brutus was
praetor urbanus in the year A.u.c. 71⁰, ,
when Caesar was killed; and in the course
of the same year he lest Rome for the pnr-
pose of taking possession, as propraetor, of
the two provinces of Macedonia and Bithy-
nia, which had been assigned him by the
senate, who revoked his appointment before
he had reached his province and asdgned
it to M. Antonius, and he made it 'over to
his brother Caius. Brutus however, in de-
fiance of the senate, took possession of the
province of Macedonia, and retained it aster
the formation of the coalition between
Augustus and M. Antonius. Being theu at
war with the senate, he led his troops into
Asia Minor as into a foreign country, and
overran Lycia, ‘and dealt with Asia as his
own province. Proceeding through the
country he probably held ‘conventus' nt
particular places for the purpose of hearing
disputes as propraetor3 and it was at such
a gathering at Clazomenae (a town on the
gulf of Smyrna) that this cause of Persius
and Rex was heard. Horace calls Brutus
praetor though he was not entitled strictly
to the name, particularly in respect to the
province of Asia which had never been
assigned him. He called himself at this
time imperator, as appears from coins still
existing. .

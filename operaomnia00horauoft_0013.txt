and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “conjecturae summi critici, etsi semper sagaces
et acutae, admodum raro a circumspecto Critico probari nunc

· ” possunt ¹.'' Nor do I think heis much more happy, in most in-

stannes (especially in the Odes), in his choice of readingaethan in
his conjectures. He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
and poetical taste‚ as well as by the excess of a prurient sagacity⁸
aud an unbounded egotisnu. The text in this edition wiu be found to
differ less from Orelli's than from any other. Where it doae so the
reason is, I think, always given in the notes. He collated some
excellent MSS„ especially three in the library at Berne‚'of which
the oldest he places at the end of the eighth century or the be-
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another of
Ziirich containing the odes, Epodes, and Ars Poetica, both of

⁷ » which he says are of the tenth century. Other MSS. referred to

iu these notes are the Vatican and other Roman MSS. collated by
Fea (1811); twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
‘ collated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth century; ,and sundry others quoted with or without
name by Lambinus (1577⁴-)‚ Gruquius (1611⁴)‚ Torrentius (1608⁴),
and Bentley (1711). Of the last the most important are four
collated by Gruquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the monks of a Benedictine monastery in Flanders, and which
were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by fire.
The oldest of these, which is appealed to as a great authority, but
which was certainly more often wrong than right- in the instances

- in which Cruquius quotes it, was said to be earlier than the ninth

Α century. On the margin of this MS. Cruquius found some old
⁴ notes, which, as he says, with infinite pains he deciphered‚ and he

HORATII FLACCI

CARMEN VII.

This ode is referred by Franke, Kirchner (p. 22), Mitscherhch, and others, to A.u.c.
722, when the last war between Augustus and M. Antonius broke out. Orelli, on the
other hand, refers it to the beginning of the war of Perusia, Ait-c. 713-14, to which

period Epode xvi. belongs.

Dillenbr. refers it, without assigning any particular

reasons, to the year 716, when Augustus was going against Sex. Pompeius. There is
very little, if any, internal evidence as to the date. None of the chronologists give any
good reason for their opinions, and the reader must judge for himself.

ARGUMENT.

Whither run ye to arms ?—hath not blood enough of Romans been shed? 'Tis not to
burn the walls of Carthage, or humble the Briton, but that the Parthian may rejoice in
seeing Rome fall by her own hand. The beasts do not war upon their kind. Is it
madness, or force irresistible, or wickedness that drives you? They are dnmb: they
answer not. 'Tis even so : the blood of Remus is visited on the destinies of Rome.

7. Intactas] See C. iii. 24. 1. What
Horace means to say is, “the blood that
has been spilt in these civil wars has been
shed not for the destruction os Carthage, as
in the war that Scipio led, or that the
Briton might be led in chains, as he was by
Julius Caesar, but sor the destruction of
Rome herself.'' ‘Intactas' means ‘un-
touched' till Julius Caesar invaded them
and carried away prisoners, many of whom
walked in his triumph. The first time after
Caesar's expeditioris that a Roman army
invaded Britain was in the expedition of
Claudius, ΛΑ). 43.

procession still more clear to the reader. It
commenced (according to the account given
in that note) at the Porta Triumphalis at
the foot of the Mons Capitolinus on the
north, and passed out of that gaoe into the
Campus Martius which lay between it and

the river. After making the ‹ir-mites the
Campus it entered the city again by flio
Porta Carmentalis, at the south anemity
of the Mons Capitolinus, where it eumd
the Velabrum, the space between that hill
and Mons Aventinus. Crosaing the Vela-
brum it passed by the Circus Maximus,
which lay between the last-named hill and
Mons Palatinus, round which it wound to
the left till it reached the spot where afler-
wards was built the arch of Constantine, on
the eastern side, opposite the spot where
Vespasian built the Amphitheatre that bore
his name, Amphitheatrum Flavianum, or, as
it is now usually called, the colosseum.
Keeping still to the lefl: the processioa came
to the Templum Veneris, adjoining which
was the Templum Romae. Here the Via
Sacra commenced and continued past the
Templum Pacis, near to which stands the
Church of Sta Maria Maggiore. There a
slight descent commences leading to the
Templum Faustinae and that of Antoninus
Pius (according to Fea, but the situation of

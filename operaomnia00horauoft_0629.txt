EPISTOLARUM Ι. 10.

Pone egeo jam mellitis potiore placentis.
Vivere naturae si convenienter oportet
Ponendaeque domo quaerenda est area primum,
Novistine locum potiorem rure beato!

Est ubi plus tepeant hiemes, ubi gratior aura.

As o mere social quoetion, which is the
only point of view Horace is concerned
with, the arfificnl stete of society and mode

natural, than a country life.

13. Ροιιεηάαεφιε domo] There are three
forms ofthis dative, ⁸ domui‚' ‘ domo,’ ‘ domi!
‘Areu' is any open space, here for building
on. The oeehuioel meaning of it is given
on C. i. 9. 18. Seneca (Ep. 90) has a

The render may compare Xenophon’s praisoe

tine (dc Ordine i. 2) uses the illustration
of a mosaic to show the folly of those who
look only to small parts of the divine dis-
pensatione rather than to the whole, and
uses Horuce’s word ‘lapiffi2’ ‘¹ Sed hoc

vermiculato pavimento nihil ultra unius
twellae modulum Μία ejus valeoet ambire,
vituperant artificem velut ordinationis et

lapillorum perturbatam putaret, a quo illa
emblemata in unius pulchritudinis faciem
congruentia simul cerni collustrarique non
possent.” Such pavements, which are now
so costly as only to be found in the richoet
honses, were formerly very common in
Italy. They were wrought in coloured
marblae, or the more ordinary onae in white
and black. Pliny (l. xxxvi. c. 64) says that
thece ‘pavimenta’ (λιθόστρωτο) were first
introduced by Sulla, who-had one made sor
the temple of Fortune ut Praenaete. He also

of such floors, und they have been found to

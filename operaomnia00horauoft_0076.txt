46 HORATII FLAGOI

Incontinentes injiciat manus
Et scindat haerentem coronam
Crinibus immeritamque vestem.

CARMEN XVIII.

There has been preserved in Athenaeus, x. p. 430, a single line of Alcaeus of which the
first verse of this ode is 'almost a literal translation. Τὶιθ metre also is the same. The
verse is as follows (44 Bergk): μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω.
Whether the rest of the ode is a translation of what follows in the poem of Alcaeus we
have no means of knowing, but 1 think in all probability it is a close adaptation. If
we were not put upon the right scent, as Ι think we are, by the above fragment, we
should suppose Horace had a friend Varus, who had a villa at Tibur, and who was making
a plantation there. Varus was the cognomen of his and Virgil's friend Quintilius, whose
death is lamented in C. xxiv. of this book. But whether or no he is the person here
referred to, or (which appears to Buttmann, and Ι agree with him, the better wuy of
putting it) whose name is used for the purpose of giving spirit to the ode, it is quite
impossible to say. “ Sterilem agrum frustra rimeris‚’' as Franke judiciously says on
another equally impossible question: It has been doubted whether Honos wrote ‘ Vare'
or ⁴ vere‚' in consequence of a note which appears in the two Scholinsoe, Acmn md
Corum. Cruq.: “suadet ut cum vernum competens tempus est nullam arborem prius
quam vitem ponat,’' from which it has been inferred that they had ‘ vere’ 'm their copies.
Some confirmation of this theory is derived from Virg. Georg. ii. 319, squ—

“ Optima vinetis satio cum vere rubenti
Candida venit avis longis invisa colnbris.”

Which Estre states is quoted by Acron. 1 do not find the quotation in my copy. All
existing MSS. and editions have ⁸ Vere! Jahn affirms that this person is ⁶ haud dubio'
the same as Canidia’s old lover, Epod. v., and Weichert (de L. Varii et Cassii Pan-mm
vita) says the same. Such boldness appears to me most irrational. 'rho respectable
names of these scholare have misled the writer of the article Varus (xii.) in smith‘a Dict-
Biog., who might have corrected his judgment by referring to Estre, to whose work ho
refers others.

Torrentius believes the person to be that unfortunate Varus whose legions were cut
off by Arminius in Germany, Am. 10. But as he supposes Catullus to have audi-cased
the same person (C. 1.), who was his junior by at least half a century, his judgment is
worth nothing. Other conjectures have been hazarded by scholars of repnte, which Estrs
has stated and disposed of very clearly.

⁴¹ Of Quintilius’ Villa ruins yet remain at 'rivoli in the quarter called aster him Quin-
tigliolo,’' says Fea, a credulous but industrious commentator.

ARGUMENT.

The vine is the first tree thou shouldst plant, Varus, by the walls of Tibur. Huchhipsm
only for the sober, wine drives away all cares. Who croaks of battle· and povcrty

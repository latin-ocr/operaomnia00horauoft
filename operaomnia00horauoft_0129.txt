liu-un (vie d’Horaee, p. 88, eq.) fixes the date in A.u.c. 715, in which year those of the
republim party who had followed Sextus Pompeius were allowed to return, peace being
made between Sextus and the triumvir-s, and an amnesty being granted to his followers.
Kirehnoe (Q. 11. p. 5) strongly supporta this opinion. Dacier ”ks why then Horace
alnnld have used the words ‘⁴ Quis te redonavit, διο. ?’' and though the words must not
be taken too literally as a question, and are more an expression of joyful surprise. yet

to me, whether even iu jeet Horace would have alluded te Philippi in the way he here
does, if he were wrifing soon aster that memorable disaster. On the whole it ia most
probable that Pompeius did not return to Rome, as Acron intimata, till aster the dvii

then of M. Antonius, aud that the ode was written A.u.c. 724, or thereebouts.

together at Philippi3 but, while I was earried off by Mercury, the wave drew thee back

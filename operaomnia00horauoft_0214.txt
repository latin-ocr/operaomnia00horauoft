184 HORATH FLAool

GARMEN XVII.

Τ118 short ode, C. i. 26, and this ode were addressed to the same person, L. Aelius Lamia
(see Introduction to C. i. 26). The language of the former ode has led to the inference
that Lamia was a young man of desponding disposition, and this that he was proud and
vain-glorious,-a sort of criticism impertinent and unreasonable as it seems to me. What
is clear is no more than that Lamia was a young man of good birth, being of the Aelia
gens, who were plebeians, but of old standing. Like other families the Lamiae were per-
haps glad to trace their origin to a fabulous hero, and believed their founder to be Lamus,
king of the Laestrygonians, and builder of Formiae, from whence they must have mi-
grated to Rome (see last ode, v. 33, n.). Horace had evidently an affection sor the young
man Lamia, whose father was a friend of Cicero's, and died rich. It is not improbable
the ode was written at his house in the country, whether at Formiae (⁴⁴ quod valde pro-
babile,'' says J ani, 1 don’t see why) 01· elsewhere. It has no particular merit, and could
have cost Horace little labour. He must have written many such that have never been
published, and these two odes were probably included in the collection out of compliment
to Lamia. But there is not the least reason why Horace should be supposed not to have
been the author of the ode3 and though it might do very well, perhaps better, without
the verses 2—5, which some editors would strike out (J ani says, ‘⁴ haud dubie spurii sunt,”
and has a long excursus to prove it), but no MSS. omit, it is the very worst species of
criticism that endeavours to bring, by corrections, omissions, and additions, the received
text into conformity with some standard which is presumed to represent 'the mind and
style of the author. If this system were not so common, especially among the commen-
tators on Horace, old and new, it would seem superfluous to say a word about it. Lamia
had a brother Quintus, who died early, to the great grief of Lucius (see Epp. i. 14. 6).
There was one of this family, according to the Scholiasts Acron and Porphyrion, who
wrote comedies ; but there is no reason to suppose it was Horace's friend. In two pas-
sages Juvenal alludes to the Lamiae as a family of distinction (S. iv. 154) :—

⁴⁴ Sed periit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus
Coeperat3 hoc nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti.”
vi. 384 :—
( > “ Quaedam de numero Lamiarum ac nominis Appi
Et farre et vino J anum Vestamque rogabat,''

where they are associated with the family of the Appii, though the reading of the MSS.

varies, and ‘alti ' is now received. Tacitus (Anu. vi. 27), mentioning the death of this
Lamia, says his ‘ genus’ was ‘ decorum.y

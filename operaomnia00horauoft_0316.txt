town of Tbessaly, and Hiberia a region
east of Colchis and south of the Caucasus,
now part of Georgia. See C. ii. 20. 20.
Elsewhere in Horace Hiber and Hiberia
have reference to Spain.

Flames of Colchis mean magic flames,
such as Medea prepared.

25. expedita] This answers to the de-
scription of Canidia herself given Sat. i. 8.

“Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla
Canidiam.’'

Sagana is there again introduced in her

company (see note).

26. Avernales aqua-⁹] So Dido in her
pretended magical oeremony sprinkledss la-
tices simulatos fontis Averni'' (Aen.iv.512).

28. currens apen] Bentley has sub-
stituted⁴ Laurens' on the conjecture of
Heinsius, and produces of course many in-
stances in which Laurentiau bears are men-
tioned. But the more common he makes
that epithet appear the less probable it be-
comes that it would have been universally
overlooked by the copyists and Scholiasts.
As Sagana is represented running about
furiously, the rushing of a boar is not a bad
simile. If Bentley had ever seen a wild
hog bursting from a jungle, and then tum-
bling along the open plain faster than dog
or rider can follow him, 118 would not have
quarrelled with the illustration. The Scho-
liast Acmn gives, either as a comment or a
various reading, ⁴ furens.’

29. nulla— conscientia] Unoonscious
or careless of the 1101111118 suffering the
child was to endure. Though she groaned,
it was only with the labour. We are to
understand that the transaction was going
on, and the grave being dug in the open
court, the ‘impluvium’ The nature and

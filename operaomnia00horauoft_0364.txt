HORATII FLACGI

Quum veto te fieri vappam jubeo ac nebulonem.

Est inter Tanai'n quiddam socerumque Viselli.

105

Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,
Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.
Illuc unde abii redeo, nemo ut avarus

Se probet ac potius laudet diversa sequentes,

Quodque aliena capella gerat distentius uber

110

'tabescat neque se majori pauperiorum
Turbae comparet, hunc atque hunc superare laboret.
Sic festinanti semper locupletior obstat,

Ut, quum carceribus missos rapit ungula currus,
Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus, illum

115

Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem.
Inde fit ut raro qui se vixisse beatum

Dicat, et exacto contentus tempore vita
Cedat uti conviva satur, reperire queamus.

⁴ frontibus adversis' with ‘ pugnantia‚’ but
that would appear to mean that the man
was reconciling two things at issue with one
another, which· 1s not Horaee' s meaning.

104. vappam] “Vappa hic dicitur per-
ditus et luxuriosus, stultus, insulsus, qui
nihil sapit; avino corrupto et evanido quod
saporem perdidit. Nebulones autem vani
et leves ut nebulae; nam cum sine certo oon-
silio vitam degant nebulis sunt et umbris
hominum similes.” These are the clear
definitions given by Cruquius' Commen-
tator.

105. Tanain—socerumque Viselli] All
that can be said of these persons now is
contained in the words of Porphyrion and
Comm. Cruq. The words of the latter are
“ Tana'is spado fuit, Maecenatis libertus; at
Visellii socer herniosus ;'' and Porphyrion
adds that some say he was a freedman of
L. Munatius Plancus. He also says that
Horace has conveyed under these names 8
well-known Greek proverb.

108. nemo ut avarus] ¹ I retnrnto that
point from whence I have digressed, how
that no covetous man is satisfied with him-
self! I adopt this reading with some mis-
giving. The hiatus is different from other
hiatuses by which Orelli defends it. ⁴ Nemo'
appears (Fea says) in the Editio Princeps
printed at Milan in 1476. It is iu the
Venetian edition of 1483, and some of
Cruquius’ MSS. and some others referred
to by Fea. The best MS. reading is

⁴nemon’, ’which would imply that Horace
had broken out again, as at the first, ‘can>

it be that no covetous man, acc. '⁹ 'rant
does not read pleasantly. B’ut Iambimu,
Bentley, Fea, Heindorf, and many others
have‘ nemon' 3’ and Heindorf argues, stom
the harshness of the transition, that the
satire· is an early productiom--a bad argu-
ment. Other readings there are, as ‘ nemo
ut sit avarus ’ (which was that of the
Scholiasta), ‘qui nemo ut avarus ς’ bnt they
do not give a clear meaning. ⁸ Redeamus:
or ‘ redeundum: would get rid of the diffi-
culty3 bnt they have no authority. reo
not agree with Dillenbr. that the feu· of
the hiatus in this place which has led to
the above corrections is “ineptus fimor.”
I do not like it at all. Horace qualifies
the general assertioni he made at the annet
by limiting his remark to the ava-icioma
See note onv.28; and on ‘laudet' seems.

110. Quodque aliena capella] This Por-
phyrion calls a proverbial saying, quoting
Ovid (A. A. i. 349)· —

“Fertilior seges est alienis semper in ag'ris,
Ἧὲιᾶιιῐιιῳιθ pecus grandius uber ha-

114. Ue, quum carceribus] See Ina-o-
dultllglhcedat uti conviva satum] These
are so like the words of Lucretius (111. 951),
that perhaps Horace remembemd them
when he wrote—

“ Cur non ut plenus vitae conviva re-
Afflsanimoque capis securam, stulte,
quietem. Ψ

Orbilium dictare; sed emendata videri
Pulchraque et exactis minimum distantia miror ς
Inter quae verbum emicuit si forte decorum, et-
Si versus paulo concinnior unus et alter,

Injuste totum ducit venditque poema.

Indignor quidquam reprehendi, non quia crasse
compositum illepideve putetur, sed quia nuper;
Nec veniam antiquis sed honorem et praemia posci.

who had given him a good education, and
being lest destitute, became an apparitor to
the magistrates in his native town. He
asterwards served in the army, and then re-
turned home and taught. In his fiftieth
year (A.u.c. 691) he came to Rome and set
up a school, which brought him more fame
than profit. He wrote a book on the ill-
treatment that teachers experienced from
the parents of their pupils. Perhaps they
had reason to find fault with him if Horace's
epithet gives a right notion of his character.
He seems to have held the rod as the prin-
ciple os school government3 wherefore the
following line was written on him by one
Domitius Marsus, “ Si quos Orbilius ferula
seuumque cecidit.” He lived in great poverty
in a garret (see Epp. i. l.9l,n.) to nearly a
hundred years of age, having long lost his
manui-y. His townspeople were proud of
him, and -erected a marble statue to his
memory. These particulars are from Sue-
tonius’ account of Orbilius in his treatise
De Illustr. Grammaticis, c. 9. Orbilius
was in his sorty-eighth year when Horace
was born. He was therefore not young
when the poet went to his school. Per-
haps Horace's judgment of Livius may have
been influenced by his early recollections,
aud “ what it then detested still abhorred,''
as a modern poet has said of Horace him-
self, “the drill'd dull lesson forced down
word by word.'' Quintilian (Dial. de Orat.)
complains that in his time the old writers
were preferred to the new: “Vobis uti-
que versantur ante oculos qui Lucilium pro
Horatio et Lucretium pro Virgilio legunt,'’
&c- Orelli thinks the boys learnt the Latin
Odyssey to enable them to understand the
Greek. If so Orbilius deserved an appli-

- caticn of his own cane. He appears to have

been one of the old school, and perhaps he
thought that pleasant learning was not good
for young minds; but Bentley, thinking it
improbable a schoolmaster of repnte would
teach boys of noble birth such language as
that of Livius, has changed Livi into

laevi, with the support of one MS.
Laevius (if he existed at all)'was a writer
of small love verses and a contemporary of
Cicero’s. He has therefore uo place here.

75. ducit venditque poemen] The mean-
ing 01 · vendit ' is the same as in Juvenal
(vii. 135), ‘⁸ purpura vendit Causidicum,
vendunt amethystina.” It commends the
whole poem. ‘Ducit’ seems to jue-ue
‘brings it fomrdss or ⁸ carries the wem
with it! A great many interpretatious
have been given, and Bentley can find no*
sense 111 this word. He therefore, on the
authority of one MS„ which he calls ‘⁴ egre-
gius codex,” changoe ‘vendit' to ‘venit,’
and makes ‘ poema' the nominative to the
verbs, and ‘ducit' he interprets ‘¹ decipit,
fuco fallit, palpo percutit,” ‘takes in pur--
chasers‚’ as “emptorem ducat hiantem ”

( 79. croc-itm floresque perambulet Attae
Fabula] Atta was a writer of comedies
(⁸ togatae ¹), of which a few fragments re-
main. He died A.u.c. 676. The title of
this play which Horace alludes to, all the
Scholiasts say was Matertera; and in re-
spect ιο ‘ erocum floresque perambulet,'
Comm. Cruq. says, “i. e. in scenam re-
cepta sit quae floribus et croco spargitur.”
It is not clear that Horace had any parti-
cular play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta’s to have flowers soet-

Aestivam sermone benigno tendere noctem.
Quo mihi fortunam si non conceditur uti?
Parcus ob heredis curam nimiumque severus
Assidet insa-no ε potare et spargere flores

Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.

Sollicitis animis onus eximit, addocet artes.

was undertaken by Torquatus, and also by
Asinius Pollio (“ insigne maestis praesidium
reis‚” C. ii. l. 13). The case would be
tried under the ‘lex Cornelia de Sicariis et
Veneficiis,' passed in the time when Sulla
was dictator ΛΑΜ). 672, directed (among
others) against all who committed murder
by poison or abetted in such murder3 for
the provisions of which ‘lex ' see Dict. Ant.
p. 285, s .

It happened that the 23d September, Au-
gustus’ birth-day, was one of those days in
which the early part was ‘nefastus;' that
is, the praetor could not hold his court
till a later hour than usual. Hence it is
marked in the Calendar N. P. (‘ Nefastus
Prior '). (See Dict. Ant. p. 186.) So that
it was doubly a holiday for Torquatus, and
he could lie in bed without damaging his
cause, and therefore might sit up late with
his friend.

12. Quo mihi fortunam] This is an
elliptical way of speaking, which must be
filled up according to the context. ⁴ Quo
mihi fortunam dedit Deus ’ may do here.
‘ Quo ’ is ‘ to what‚’ that is, ‘ to what pur-
purpose,' as:

‘⁴ guobpinus ἰιζιςειιὶι811 albaque populus t
w.» 50¹1.. {waram m

where there is an ellipse. Ovid has ‘⁴ Quo
mihi fortunam quae nunquam fallere curet ?'’
(Am. ii. 19. 7); and Phaedrus “ Quo mi,
inquit, mutam speciem si vincor sono.''
Many MSS. and editions have ‘ quo mihi
fortuna,' against the metre. The omission
of the mark over the final ¹ ἴι ’ may account
for this.

14. Assidet imaum] As ‘dissidet’ is
used to signify difference, Horace uses ‘ as-
sidet ’ to signify resemblance. It is not so
used elsewhere. The guests not uncom-
monly wore wreaths of flowers on their
heads, and carried them in their hands 3 and
we can understand their scattering them

about the table and fioor, especially when
they were men-y. But it appears· that the
slaves scattered flowers about for the sake
of their perfume, and in a picture dis-
covered at Pompeii there is a representation
of a young man and woman reclining ou a
couch before a small table, with nowers
strewed about the floor. The man is drink-
ing from a horn (ῥυτόν), and the woman
is taking a small box from a female aluo,
supposed to be a ‘myrotheca' or box uf
perfumes. Horace says: “Parcentes ego
dexteras Odi: sparge rosas” (C. iii. 19.
21). Fresh flowers were pmbablymtoeed
at intervals during the dinner.

15. patiarque vel inconsultus haberi-J
SeeC.ii.7.28: “receptoDulcemihifurere
est amico.” C. iii. 19. 18: “ Insanit-e

16. Quid non ebrietas desiqnat t] For·
cellini explains ⁴ designare' here by “rem
aliquam insignem patrare, sed enm nota et
ignominia,’' quoting besides this phac Te-
rence (Adelph. i. 2. 6)=

¹⁴ — quse sacta mt
Omitt03 modo quid designavit. Mi. Quid-
Ddiafmoigsegiiiegit atque in aedes irruit ;”

on which Donatus says, ‘⁴ designare ene
rem novam facere in utramque partem
et bonam et malam ;” that is, to do any
thing out of the common way. If this
be the meaning, and 1 know no¹ otherf
Horace says ‘what strange things will not
ebriety do?' (See Epp. i. 7. 6, n., on
‘designator.') As to ‘operta recludit' com-
pare C. i. 18. 163 iii. 21.16; Epod. xi. 14,
and the places quoted in the note on S. i.
4. 89, “verax aperit praecordia Libere’
‘ Spes jubet esse ratas, ad proelia trudit in-
ertem’ agrees with what Aristotle says
(Nic. Eth. iii. 8): τοιοῦτον δὲ ποιοῦσι καὶ
οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, εὐέλπιδες γὰρ γίνονται,
that is, they gain courage by gaining sels-
confidence.

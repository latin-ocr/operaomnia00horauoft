602 HORATII FLAOGI

Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo
Imploravit opes hominis frenumque recepit ;
Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste
Non equitem dorso, non frenum depulit ore.
Sic qui pauperiem veritus potiore metallis
Libertate caret, dominum vehit improbus atque
Serviet aeternum, quia parvo nesciet uti.

Oui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,

Si pede major erit subvertet, si minor uret.
Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi,

Nec me dimittes incastigatum ubi plura
Cogere quam satis est ac non cessare videbor.
Imperat aut servit collecta pecunia cuique,
Tortum digna sequi potius quam ducere funem.
Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae,
Excepto ‘quod non simul esses caetera laetus.

that of every MS. and the Scholiasts, and
expresses the struggle with which the horse
won his victory and his servitude.

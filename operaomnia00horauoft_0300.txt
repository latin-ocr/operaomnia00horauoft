HORATII FLA Col

ARGUMENT.

Thou art going into the midst of danger, Maecenas, to share the fortunas of Caesar.
Shall Ι stay at home at ease, or meet the danger with thee, on whose life my happiness
depends ? I will go with thee whithersoever thou goest. To what end shall I go? As
the bird fears less for her young when she is near them, so shall I sear less for thee if
Ι go with thee, and I go to win thy love not thy favours. Thy love hath given me
enough. I seek not wide lands or fine houses and cattle, and gold to hide or to

squander.

1. Liburnis] These were light vessels
that took their name from the ships used
by the Liburnians, a piratical tribe on the
Illyrian coast. Augustus employed them
in his expeditions against Sex. Pompeius,
and they were of great use at Actium (C.· 1.
37. 30). It is disputed whether ⁴ inter alta
propugnacula' refers to Antonius' ships or
Caesar's. I have no doubt the former are
intended. Horace is speaking of the danger
Maecenas is going to encounter, and Ι 110
not know that that could be better described
than by contrasting the light galleys of
Caesar' s fleet with the heavy ships of the
enemy3 and though there may have been,
and of course were ships of larger size in
the fleet (as Dillenbr. says, taking the other
view of the sense), the danger would not
have been described by mentioning them.
‘ Ibis inter ' may not be a proper phrase for
describing an attack upon the enemy's fleet,
but it may do very well for contrasting the
size of the ships on either side. I do not
see how the danger would have been ade-
quately described by representing Maecenas
as sailing in a light vessel among the larger
01183 giving his orders, as some have ex-
plained it. Such a description would have
diminished the picture of danger, and only
represented the honour of the command.
Propertius represents Caesar's fleet only by
the Liburnianpart of it :—

⁴⁴ Ausa (Cleopatra dared) Jovi nostro la-
trantem opponere Anubim

Baridos et contis rostra Liburna sequi”
(iii. 11. ‹sl—44),

 

where he speaks contemptuously of hes·
fleet for his own purpose, but all writers on
the battle of Actium describe the ships of
M. Antonius and Cleopatra as of enormous
size. Like those of Caesar, the Egyptian
vessels were fitted with towers (⁴ propug
nacula' )‚ from which the men fought.
Wood- cuts representing such ships will be
found' 111 Smith’ s Dict. Ant. 111-1.* pShips.’

4. Sabin—tum] ‘'1'ui,' to agree with

‘Caesaris ' 1133 118811 suggested. ‘Tuo peri-
culo,’ ‘Jmeo *’3110, *,’1103151-ο sne all oue as
common as the other, and without the pos-
sgshsige pronoun ‘periculum’ ⁶ng used m the
a ve case in⁴ summo 0, minimo
periculo‚' &c. (see Fomeiffiwhe’rb the ab·
lative is an ablative of eost, and is not to he
explained by supplying ⁴ cum.' Whether
a note of interrogation should be put after
⁴ tuo ’ is a matter of taste. Bentley thinks
it more pathetic. It appears to me less
simple and manly.

5. si superstite] The old Venetis: edi-
tion of 1483, and all the editions after that ·
till Bentley' s that 1 have seen, have ‘siu’
But the Scholiast Porphyrion read‘ 31,’
saying‘ ‘bis posuit particulam‘ si; ’3811181
abundat.” Torrentius, reading ⁸ sit,3 notices
the reading * 31 ' in one of his MSS„ which
has a note in the margin, ‘⁴ si abunda&
Another MS. has ⁴ sic! Bentley mentions
six MSS. which have ⁴ si,' and Orelli eleven
more. Two of Orelli’s best, and others
referred to by Bentley, have no word be-
tween ⁴ vita’ and ‘superstite’ which ap-
pears as if some syllable supposed to be
redundant. had been purposely omitted,

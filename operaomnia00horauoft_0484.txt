HORATII FLAOGI

Festos albatus celebret, cornu ipse bilibri
Gaulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.
Quali igitur victu sapiens utetur, et horum

Utrum imitabitur ἓ

Mundus erit qua non offendat sordibus, atque
In neutram partem cultus miser.

Albuti senis exemplo, dum munia didit
Saevus erit; nec sic ut simplex Naevius unctam

Hac urget lupus, hac canis, aiunt.

Hic neque servis,
Convivis praebebit aquam ; vitium hoc quoque magnum.

Accipe nunc victus tenuis quae quantaque secum .
Imprimis valeas bene : nam variae res

Afferat.

Ut noceant homini credas memor illius escae

Quae simplex olim tibi sederit ;

Miscueris elixa, simul conchylia turdis,

toga especially clean. The ordinary toga
was not dyed. The natural whitenaes of
the wool was increased by the process of
cleaning, in which it was rubbed with dif-
ferent kinds of fuller’s earth (⁴ creta ful-
lonis’), and also exposed to steams os sul-
phur, which removed stains of any kind.
‘Albatus,’ therefore, signifies in a toga
which has just come from the ‘fulla’ It
was usual for persons who were canvassing
for offices to have their toga unusually
whitened with an extra supply of ‘creta,’
whence they were called ⁴ candidati! Theo-
phrastus (Charac. περὶ μικρολογίας) speaks
of mean persons as πρὸς τοὺς γναφεῖς δια-

τεινομένους ὅπως τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῖς ἕξει
πολλὴν γῆν ἵνα μὴ ρηπαίνηται ταχύ.

61. cornu ipae bilibri] The ‘cornu’
was the horn vessel in which the 011 was
kept. Instead of having a cruet or small
vessel suited to the dinner-table, such as
wealthy people usually had of silver and
others of cheaper material, he would bring
down the big horn, and with his own hand,
lest others should be too liberal, drop the
smallest quantity of 011 upon the cabbage
while of his old vinegar, which would turri
his guests, if he had any, from the dish,
he was free enough. So that the reading
‘ largus’ for ‘ parcus' which Gesner sup-
ports is out of place. It has little authority.

64. aiunt.] τὸ λεγόμενον, ‘as the saying

though not now isset with elsewhere. The
old editions, without any exception I be-
lieve (till Lambinus), and Porphyrion, have

all his MSS„ which* is hardly credible. He

edits ‘angit’ All Cruquius’ but two ot
little value had ‘aiunt' Torrentius edita
’ angit‚' but approves οἰ ‘ainnt,' on the
authority of his best MSS. The maJ’ority
of the Parisian MSS„ and Orelli's three
best, have ‘ aiunt!

65. Mundus erit qua non] ’ Δ man will
be decent so far as (‘qua’) he does not
offend by meannoes, and 13 011 neither hand
sordid in his way of living!

67. Albuti senis] See S. i. 48. n. What
more is given by the Scholiasta is hardly
worth repeating, for it is only drawn from
the text as any one may see. The say the

Lambinus, to illustrate the character Hoeaoe
gives of liim, refers to the story told by.
Plutarch 111 his life of Julius Caesar·¹ (c. 17)
of Valerius Leo, who put before tho Die-
tator some as covered with ointment
instead of 011. Such ⁴ simplicity,' amounting
to an indifference to the decencies of life, and
a want of consideration for others, which
some people almost look upon as a virtue,
Horace very properly describes as a great
vme.

things remained quiet upon your stomach!

GARMINUM Ι. 37.

Gontaminato eum grege turpium

Morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens

Sperare fortunaque dulei
Ebria. Sed minuit furorem
vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico

Redegit in veros timores

Caesar, ab Italia volantem
Remis adurgens, accipiter velut
Molles columbas aut leporem citus

Venator in eampis nivalis
Haemoniae, daret ut catenis

Fatale monstrum: quae generosius
Perire quaerens nee muliebriter
Expavit ensem nec latentes
Classe cita reparavit oras.

fleet escaped from the battle of Actium, but
M. Antonius saved no morethan his own ship
in which he fied to Egypt. No allusion is
madeto M. Antonius throughout the ode, for
the same reason that led Augustus ιο re-
quire the Senate to proclaim war onlyagainst
Cleopatra though M. Antonius was the chief
ob'ect of it.

J14. Mentem-e lymphatam Mareotico]
‘ Lympham ' is equivalent to νυμφόληπτος,
‘ lympha' and ‘ nympha' being the same
word (see romeu). Mareotic wine was
from the shores of the Iake Mareotis in the
neighbourhood of Alexandria. ‘In veros
timoroe' is opposed to what the Greeks
‹alled τὰ ewa* τοῦ πολέμου. Cleopatra’s
fleet fled from Actium before a blow was
struck, under the influence of a pmc, but
Horace choosae to say it was a ‘verus
timor! The historical facts are not aecu-
rately represented in this ode. Though it
is said that Cleopatra meditatod a desoent

dria, and the deaths of M. Antonius and
Cleopatra occurred.

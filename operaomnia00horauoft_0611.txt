and being superseded in his command by
cn. Pompeius, he returned to Rome with
great wealth accumulated by himself in Asia
(for he inherited nothing from his father),

which he devoted to every sort of sels-

household furniture, and the extravagance
ofhis meals andway of living, surpoesed
any thing that had ever been known before,
and even in the imperial times his gardens,
Plutarch says, were amongst the most
noble. From his extravagant works, by
which he levelled hills and checked the
watersofthesea, hewascalledbyhiscon·
componi-les ‘Xerxes togatus! Plutarch
relates (in the same chapter) this anecdote
of Horace' s, only giving a smaller number
of purple clbaks, which Horace puts at ten
times the number applied for, and Plutarch,
perhaps with more ptruth‚ if there vis any
u-uth in the story, only doubles. sse
story as Plutarch tells it is, that a
praetor who wished to get up a public
spectacle on an ambitious scale (φιλοτι-
μουμένου Ιπερὶ θέας) applied to Lucullus to
lend him some purple cloaks for a chorus.
Lucullus said he would inquire, and if he
had any he would let him have them.
The next day he asked him how many he
wanted, and when the ‘praetor' said a
hundred, Lucullus bade him take twice that
number. Plutarch refers to Horace's men-
tion of the story, and seems to think his
comment upon it, that a man to be rich
ought to know only a small part of his pos·
sessions, is meant seriously. He gives that
as Horace' s opinion, whereas it is plain he
is only speaking ironically.

The ‘’chlamys was an upper garment

worn by the Greeks, a light sort of shawl
thrown loosely over the person in a variety
of ways (see Dict. Ant), of which a speci·

men is seen in the Belvedere Apollo. The
Romans did not wear it till the time os the
empire. and it was never more than an
occasional garment at Rome. Lucullus it
seems had brought with him a large number
of a costly kind from Asia, where they were
worn in the Greek citios. What the repre-
sentation may have been for which the
praetor wanted these‘ chlamy des' is not
certain, bntGreekcharacters must have been
introduced.

50. Mereemur servum] There was a
class of slavoe called ‘nomenclatores’ or
‘’fartooes (crammers), ὀνοματολόγοι, whose
office it was to accompany their master when
walking, or attend him at home at the honr
of‘ salutatio’ (when, if he was a person οἱ
consequence, people of all sorts came to
pay him their respects)‚ and to remind him
of the names and circumstances of his visi-
tors, and any thing else that it might be
necessary for the master to remember. If
he was aiming at any office he had to be
particularly polite to the citizens of all
classes, and his‘ nomenclator,’ if he were
elever, would be of good¹ service to him
in this matter. Horace’s advice to tho
man who thinks happiness depends on
such things as show and popularity (⁴ species
et gratia ¹), is, that he should hire a elever
‘nomenclator,' is he had not one of his
own, to go with him through the snecta,
and nudge him whenever he came to any
one of influence and remind him to shake
hands and say something civil to him,
calling him affectionately‘ my brother:
my father,' according to his age. (This
shows us that the canvassing and electioris
still continued. Some people suppooe that
Augustus at once put ιιι end to the old
forms, which is not the case.) ‘Nomen-
clatores ' were also employed to explain to

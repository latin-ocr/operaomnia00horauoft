INTRODUOTION. xxiii

  

Ο. i. o.-'.1'his metre consists of three Asclepiadem verses, such as
Ο. 1, and a Glyconean, as in O. 3. In C. i. 15. 24 and 36 a trochee
occurs in the first foot (see note). The other Odes are i. 24, 33; ii.

> ,12; m 10, 163 iv. 5, 12.

0. i. 7.--Τ11ἰ8 measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyric poet of
Sparta. It consiste of two verses, of which the first is a complete hexa-
meter, and the second is made up of the· four last feet of an hexameter.

¹ 'ro this belong 8. i. 28, and Epod. xii.

C. i. 8.—There is no other Ode in this metre, which also consists of

³ two verses. The first consiste of a dactyl and two trochees‚ or a trochee

and spondee, - υ u Ι - υ Ι ,, :- This takes its name fr01n Aristo-
phanes. The second is 8 dimeter verse, of which the first half consiste
of two trochees and 8 dactyL with 8 long syllable added, and the second
halfis the first reversed, thus ε ’ ’

-ul-vl-uul—ss-uul-ul-c

Τ Horace always has 8 spondee in the second place.

.1 ⁷0· i. 9.—This is the ordinary Alcaic metre, in which each stanza con· ‚
¹ :ists of four versos The two first are divided thus:

though Horace usually substitutes a spondee for the second trochee‚
{⁴⁴ the only exception being iii. 5. 1¹7. The caesura usually falls after the

fiflzh syllable, to which rule exceptions will be found in G. i. 16. 21, 37.
⁷ 5, 14; ii.·1‘7. 21; iv. 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did not observe.
Tho syllable which forms the basis, as it is called, of the verse, is more

ἐ commonly long than short. It is usual to look upon the first part of
> , the verse as iambic. I have no doubt it is trochaic. The third verse is

also trochaic‚ consisting of a syllable (usually long) followed by four
trochees, 8 spondee being substituted by Horace for the second tmehee.
The fourth verse consists of two dactyls and two trochees.

O. i. 11.—This is an Asclepiadean metre, rather peculiar. The divi-

ς sion to which we are guided by the ear seems to separate each verse into

’ three parts, as follows:

--Ι-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ--Η-υυΙ-υυ

ξ This classes it with the ἀσυνάρτητα. Those who resort to the division
“’ by choi-iambica destroy the natural, rhythm. To this belong i. 18; iv.

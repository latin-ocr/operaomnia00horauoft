HORATII FLAGOI

I pete unguentum, puer, et coronas

Et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,

Spartacum si qua potuit vagantem
Fallere testa.

Dic et argutae properet Neaerae

Murrheum nodo cohibere crinem3

Si per invisum mora janitorem

Fiet, abito.

Lenit albescens animos capillus 25
Litium et rixae cupidos protervae;
Non ego hoc ferrem calidus juventa

Consule Planco.

erat domesticus; tumultum Gallicum quod
erat Italiae finitimus; praeterea nullum
nominabant. Gravius autem tumultum aese
quam bellum hinc intelligi licet quod bello
vacationes valent tumultu non valent.''

Again, Cicero says (in Verr. ii. 4. 23),
‘⁴ Scuta si quando conquirantur a privatis
in bello ac tumultu, tamen homines inviti
dant, etsi ad salutem communem dari sen-
tiunt.’' Tumultus, therefore was a public
affair, “a sudden rising or hostile demon-
stration,” as Mr. Long says on the above
152⁵&ss 2113322255033302115353222502532·
tween the two will be found on referring to
the article ‘Vis’ in Smith's Dict. Ant.
Horace, says he, is not afraid of losing his
life by any popular insurrection and so
forth, or by the hand of an assassin or
private malice.

18. Marsi memorem duelli‚] The Mai-sic
or Social War continued from A.u.c. 663 ιο
665, and the Sei-vile War, headed by Spar-
tacus, from 681 to 683. Therefore the
wine Horace wanted would have been sixty-
five years old at least. Thiare seems to have

been something remarkable in the vintage
of that period so as to make it p;roverbial
for Juvenal, one hundred ears aflei-warda,

speaking ofthe selfish gen manwhokeeps
hisbest wine forhisowndrinking,says,—

“Ipse capillato diffusum consule potat
calcatamque tenet bellis Ἥ §.1⁸:23

The ‘cadus,' ‘testa,' and ‘ amphora‚' wan dl
names for the same vessel.

22. Murrheum] Ι know iio way of set-
tling the orthography of this word. ‘ Mur·
reum’ is Bentley’s; ⁴ Myrrheum’ that of
Lambinus and others. Forcell. givoe them
all, and does not decide. ¹ Cohibere' is the
reading of all the MSS. Bentley prefers
his own conjecture ‘ cohibente.5

28. Consule Planta] L. Munatiu- Plan·
cus was consul with M. Aemilius tepidus
A.u.c. 712, at which time Horace was in
his twenty-third year.—This use of the im·
perfect subjunctive is sufficiently common
to have saved Dillenb. his forced interpre-
tation, ‘⁴ non ego hoc ferrem si essem calidiu
juventa qua vigui Consule Planco-'⁹ ·

CARMEN XV.

This ode combines with the lyric something of the spii-it of the Epodes. It is impon-
sible to say why Horace chose so often this same subject, bnt he always handles it very
sharply. (See C. i. 25, · iv. 13.) There are not wanting, of course, those who suppose he
wrote under the influence of his own disappointments, and who find particular perinde of

his life suitable for the composition of each.

This too has accordingly had diffoeentdates

assigned it. But 1 need not trouble the render with such discussions.

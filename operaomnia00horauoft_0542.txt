HORATII FLAGOI

loo

Audieris, HERES : Ergo'nunc Dama sodalis
Unde mihi tam fortem tamque fidelem?
Sparge subinde, et, si paulum potes, illacrimare ε est
Sepulcrum
Permissum arbitrio sine sordibus exstrue 3, funus 105
Si quis
Forte coheredum senior male tussiet, huic tu
Dic, ex parte tua seu fundi sive domus sit
Sed me

Imperiosa trahit Proserpina3 vive valeque.”

100. Et certum viyilans,] Bentley illus-
trates this by Ovid (Heroid. x. 9) z

‘⁴ Incertum vigilans, a somno languida, movi
Thesea pressuras semisupina manus ;''

and Statius (Theb. v. 212):
“Turbidus incertumque oculis vigilantibus
chplsffijn,

It means therefore ‘ wide awakess not eon-
fusedly as those who are half asleep.

— Quartae sit partis] The ⁴ heres ' of one
fourth of the property would be ‘ ex quad-
rante ' or ‘ex teruncio.’ (See note on v. 53,
above). Τὶιθ formula in wills was such as
this: ‘¹ Sola mihi uxor heres esto,’' ‘⁶ Sem-
pronius ex parte dimidia heres esto ;”
wherefore Bentley, with very little autho-
rity, substitutes ¹ esto ' for ‘ sit! v

101. Dama] See 2. 18. He is to
throw in now and then (⁴ sparge subinde ’) a
whine for the dear man that is gone, and
squeeze out a tear if he possibly can.

102. Unde mihi tam sortem] This abrupt
and elliptical way of speaking occurs again
below (S. 7. 116): “Unde mihi lapidem?
Quorsum est opus? Unde sagittas ?” Se-
neca (Herc. Fur. 296) has the same:

ί

unde illum mihi
Quo te tuamque dexteram amplectar diem ? ’ '

 

Compare the broken language Parmeno
puts in Phaedria’s mouth in Terence (Eun.
i. 1. 20): ὅ( Egone illam, quae illum? quae
me? quae non?'’ &c. ⁴ Parabo’ may be
understood, or some such word.

103. est] This is equivalent to ἔξεστι.
Lambinus quotes this verse from a far-ce of
Publius Syrus: “ Heredis fletus sub per-
sona risus est.''

105. Permissum arbitrio] A sum of
money was generally named in the will for
the funeral expenses. Sometimes they
appear to have been left expressly to the
judgment and liberality of the ‘ heres' or

⁸ heredes ' as here. But if no mention was
made of this subject in the will, or if a
man died intestam, those who sueceeded to
the property were bound to provide all that
was decent for his intermeat. As to ‘ sunuel
see note on S. i. 6. 43. ‘ Commissum’
was the common reading before Lambinus
(though Ven. 1483, has ⁸ permissum ’)‚ but
⁴ permissum ’ has more authority, and Inm-
binus says truly “ committere fidei dicimus,
poteris permittere potestati et arbitrio.”
See C. i. 9. 9: “ permitte divis meten.”

108. seu fundi sive domm sit Emptom]
⁴ Fundus ’ is a lauded estate together with
the buildings upon it. ‘ Domus ¹ therefore,
which is opposed to ‘fundus' here, and in
Epp. i. 2. 47, may mean a town-house. 'Hie
advice is, that if one of the man’s ⁴ coheredes,'
who is old, and by a bad cough shows he is
near his end, expresses a wish to have an
estate or house which forms part of his
share, he should decla-re himself delighted
to make it over to him for a nomina! price,
a single ‘ sestertius! This would be a bold
game, but he might hope that such gene-
rosity on his part would be remembered in
the sick man's will. ⁴ Addicere' is a legal
term used in selling, ‘⁴ and signifiee the de-
claration of him who sells as to the transfer
of the thing to the buyer” (Iaong, Verr. ii.
2. 32). It was used in private bai-gains as
here, and at public auctions it was the voni
used for declaring who was the purchaser.
For all the meanings of ‘ addicere‚' ‘ ad-
dictus‚’ ⁸ addictio, ' with examples, see
Forcell. Suetonius, speaking of Caesar’s
fondness for Servilia, and his rich presents
to her, says (c. 50), “ super alias donationes
amplissima praedia ex auctionibus hastae ei
nummo addixit,’' where ‘ minimo ’ has been
proposed for ‘ nummo,’ and appears in some
MSS. I do· not see what is gained by the
change. Either way he must have tam-
pered vastly with the public auctions for
the bencfit of his mistress.

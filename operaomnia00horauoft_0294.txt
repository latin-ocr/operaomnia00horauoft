the Greek Γενετυλλίς, which was applied to
Aphrodite as well asArtemis and her ‚at-
tendants. Bentley contends for the Greek
form being retained, and considers ‘Geni-
talis' 8 corrupt reading for ⁴ Genityllis ἐ
“locum esse corruptum et contaminatum
existimo, vel potins certo scio.'’ If Horace
had written ‘ Genityllis ’ it would have been
another way of expressing the same name;
but 88 ‘ Genitalis ' cannot be objected to 88
1118 Latin form of that word, and 811 1118
MSS. have it, there is no reason for alter-
ing it. ‘ Eileithuia ' could not be repre-
sented by any equivalent in Latin; it is
therefore no proof that Horace used the
Greek form in the one case that he did 8ο
111 1118 other, as Bentley affirms. Besides
which it would seem that the Latin names
are purposely introduced in contrast to the
Greek. ⁴ Producas ’ here signifies ⁸ to rear ’
as in C. ii. 13. 3. Respecting the ‘lex
Julia de maritandis ordinibus ⁹ referred to
in the fifth stanza, the reader may get all
the information he wants from Mr. Long's
article in Smith’s Dict. Ant. ⁴ Lex J ulia et
Papia Poppaea! .

21. Certus undenos] The notion that
the Secular Games were celebrated every
110 years, which seems to have been the
length of a saeculum 88 measured by the
Etruscam, was a fiction invented probably
at this time. There is no trace or probability
of their having been so celebrated either
before or after Augustus. They lasted three
days and nights. They were celebrated by

Clautggs Am. 47, 81111 again by Domitian
Λ.11. . ’

25. ver-acce cecini-seed A great deal of
difficulty 1188 been raised respecting the
meaning of this stanza, and the reading,
which in the MSS. varies between ‘ dictum
est' and ¹ dictum’ without ⁴ est,' ‘ servat’
and ‘servet.' Bentley has increased the
trouble of commentatore in attempting to
lighten it by the substitution of ‘ stabilis per
aevum’ for ‘stabilisque rerum ’ and omit-
ting ‘esa’ The great majority of MSS.
read ‘est’ and ‘sewen’ the meaning in
that case being made plain by supposing
⁴ stabilis—servet' to be parenthetica: ‘ye
Parcae who tell truly what has once been
determined (and may the fixed order of
events preserve 11 80),’ 1101 88 Diu. explains,
‘ye Parcae who truly prophesy, add good
destinies to those that we have known, ac-
cording to that which 1188 01188 been de-
clar-ed and which may,' διο. ‘Veraoes
cecinisse ’ cannot properly stand alone, par-
ticularly with ‘ quod ’ immediately following.
But ‘servat ’ (which seems, however, to have
but litt-le authority from the MSS.) appears Ι
to be the simpler reading, for ‘ quod'· does
not in this case, as Bentley states, require
the subjunctive mood. Supposing ‘ servat'
to be the reading, Horace merely 818188 8
fact, that the Parcae truly foretold the de-
stined greatness of Rome which, once for all
decreed, the course of events was daily con-
firming. I agree with Orelli in preferring
this reading, which Lambinus also preferred,
though he adopted ‘ servet! ί8811181,’ 111
1118 881188 of ‘once for all' (καθάπαξ), is
common enough. The Pareae could not

Ac mulae nautaeque caput lumbosque saligno
Fuste dolat: quarta vix demum exponimur hora.
Ora manusque tua lavimus, Feronia, lympha.

Impositum saxis late candentibus Anxur.
Huc venturus erat Maecenas optimus atque
Cocceius, missi magnis de rebus uterque
Legati, aversos soliti componere amicos.

Hic oculis ego nigra meis collyria lippus
Interea Maecenas advenit atque

Illinere.

Cocceius seems to have become especially
intimate with Augustus without betraying
his fi-iends· sor M. Antonius. According
10 Appianv vso, sqq) it was this Lucius
Cocceius whobyhistactandgoodsense
was the means of bringing about the recon-
ciliation which took place (mu-c. 714) be-,
tween his two friends. But Lucius had, as
Appiam mentions, 0 brother, 0011 these two
have been confounded. The brother's
name was Marcus; whereas Appian men-
tions this Cocceius expressly as Lucius.
An'mwc ἦν Κοκκὴιος ἐκατέρῳ φίλος. Ur-
sini (Fam. Rom. p. 65) thinks Lucius here
13 0 mistake for Marcus, and there is some
ground in Appian's own statem-t for sup-
posing such is the case. He says of Coc-
ceius arguing with Antonius, οὐι eia πω
τὸν Καίσαρα καλεῖν ἐχθρὸν, ἔς τε Λεύκιον .
καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ’Am-uvion φὶλους τοιόνδε
γεγενημένον· and when 118 returns to Au·
gustus the latter chides him for delaying,
οὗ γὰρ ἔφη καὶ τὸν σὸν ἀδελφὸν” ιν ’ἐχθρὸς
ἧς μοι περιέσωσα· which makes it appear
that the Cocceius who 0830601811 1118 re-
conciliation Appian refers to (see Introduc-

tion) was not the person whose life was

spared at Perusia, but 1113 brother. But
the former is called Lucius, the negodm,
therefore, was, aoeording to this account,
Marcus. 'rhis’ Marcus was probably great-
grandfather of 1118 Empemr Nerva. See

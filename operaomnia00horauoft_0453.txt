SATIRARUM I. 9.

Qui pulchre nosset. Consistimus. Unde venis? et

Quo tendis! rogat et respondet,

Vellere coepi

’ Et prensare manu lentissima brachia, nutans,

Distorquens oculos, ut me eriperet.

Male salsus 65

Ridens dissimulare : meum jecur urere bilis.
“ Certe neseio quid secreto velle loqui te

Aiebas mecum.''

62. Qua· pulchre nosset. ] The commen-
tators do not notice this subjunctive, aud
yet it is not readily explained. The mean·
ing is, ‘one who knew him well3’ but 1 am
not aware ofany ypassage that exactly corre-
spondswith this.

64. Ee premere manu] Ι prefer this to
‘pressam’ which Orelli edits, referring
‘vellere'to the‘toga! Bentleyalsoreads
‘prensare,’ which appears in all the old
editions, and was first altered by Lambinus.

69. tricesima sabbata.- ·] Very much has
been said on these words. Orelli gives a
calculation by Roeder, corrected by a dis-
whose ιιῗιδιιιθᾱὶζὲῃῖἰοθε ῗιχιξΐῃιιιζίιιῐῒίξῗιοιῗνῗίἰι,
taking' ιιι the twenty· -five Sabbaths from the
lst of Abib to Tisri, the seventh mouth,
filling thereto the σάββατον δευτερόπρω-
rev—mentioued by St. Luke (vi. l), and
med to be the l5th of Nisan, which
Jooephur says (Arch. iii. 10. 53 xiii. 8. 4)

on talking about nothing.

the Jews held as a sabbam—md the day of
Pentecost, which was also a sabbath, and
then adding the feast of Trumpets on the
lst Tisri, the 5th Tisri which was the
regular sabbath, and the 16th which m
the great day of atonement, make· this last
solemn day, on which whosoever did not
afflict himself should be cut off from among
the people (Levit. xxiii. 29), the ⁴ tricofima
sabbata,' or thirtieth sabbath from the
beginning of the Jewish sacred year.
Roeder himself, omitting St. Luke's sab-
bath and Pentecost, and adding the regular
sabbath on the leth 'l'isri and the Feast of
Tabernacles on the l5th, makes that the
great day in question. ΤΙιε opinion of v
Scaliger was, that the Jews observed the
30thg day of each month m a sabbath.
Gesner and Doering, and some others,
follow Scaliger. Others suppose the day
of the Passover to be the sabbath m ques-
tion, and by calculatione try to prove that
it might have been. 1 do not find that it
is made out on any authority that the Jews
had any sabbath that they called the thir-
tietb, and 1 very much ydoubt the fact.
Τ1ιθ utter contempt with which the Romans,
especially of Horace's class, looked upon
the Jewish superstitious (as they counted
them), is the oesence of the joke' ιιι the text.
That the Jews had a sabbath of course
every body knew. That they had a sabbas
tical year and a year of J ubilee no doubt was
known to some, and that this came round
every fisty years; also that they obmved
days and months and years with scrupulum
exactness. Beyond this Ι should imagine
Aristius Fuscus knew little or nothing of
the Jews, except that they were a trouble-
some set of people, and lived by themselves
on the other side of the Tiber, not far by
the bye from where the party were stand-
ing. ‘ Tricesima sabbata ' 1 believe to be a
mere extemporaneous invention made to
cover his retreat and tantalize his unfor-
tunate ffiend. Until some more definite
account is given of the matter than any 1

have read, 1 shall venture to hold the above

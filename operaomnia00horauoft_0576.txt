546 HORATII FLAOOI

ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, more honoured than all the world, I have received my discharge ; seek not to
call me back ; my years and my inclinatione are not what they were. Let me hang up
my arms and retire. A warning voice within bids me loose the aged steed lest he
stumble at the end of his course. Verse Ι lay aside, and turn all my thoughts to
philosophy and virtue, and am laying up stores of these.

(v. 13.) Ι belong, if you ask me, to no school, and own no master, but am borne along
wherever the breeze may set: now all activity and virtue with the Stoics, now insen-
sibly falling into the laxity of Aristippus. The days are wear-y till Ι shall have learnt
to act out what neither rich nor poor, young nor old, can neglect with impunity.
Meantime I can only take the little knowledge I have for my guide aud comfort. If
we cannot reach perfection, we may advance towards it. There are charms iu philosophy
for every disease. Ambition, envy, passion, sloth, intemperance, lusa—au that is most
savage may be tamed if it turn a willing ear to instruction. The first step in virtue
and wisdom is to abandon vice and folly. For instance, you who are hastening to be -
rich, and flying from the disgrace of poverty, will you not learn from the wiso to
despise those things you love so foolishly ? Would the boxer who fights in the streets
despise the Olympio crown which should be offered him without a blow?

(v. 52.) Believe me virtue is above the worth of gold, though the whole Forum may say
otherwise, and old and young may learn the lesson, crying, ‘Money first and then
virtue) Be able, good, eloquent, honest, as you will, let your property fall short but
by a little of the equestrian and you are nobody. Never mind; the children will call
you King if you do well. Let this be your stronghold, a conscience void of offence. Α
Which is best, Roscius’ law or the boys’, which the good old soldiers Curius and ¹
Camillus approved ? Which is your best adviser, he who bids you get money how you

- can, that you may sit a little nearer the stage, or he who stands ever at your elbow and
bids and teaches you to defy the caprices of Fortune ἓ

(v. 70.) And if 1 be asked why Ι hold not the opinions of the world 1 mix with, my
answer is that which the fox made to the lion: because I see all the footmarks turned
towards your den and none the other way. Whom or what am I to follow? One man
is getting rich by one foul way and another by another, aud no one is consistent even
with himself. A man takes a fancy to build on the coast at Baiae, the next day he is

 

off inland tc Teanum. If he is married he wishes himself a bachelon if not he wishes
he was. And even the poor man, he must change his lodgings and his furniture, aud
hire himself a boat to ape the rich man’s yacht.

(v. 94.) And you too my friend, you laugh at me if the barber has cut my hair awry, or
if my vest is shabby while my tunic is fine: but graver inconsistencies you care not for. 4
In respect of these you think I am but as mad as my neighbours and want no guardian,
and this though you are my protector and are vexed with me for the smallest neglect
of my body, and though 1 look to you and hang upon you like a child.

(v. 106.) In short, to go back. The wise man is only inferior to great Jove,—rich, free, .
respected, handsome, and a king of kings, but above all sound except when his stomach ἐ
is out of order. ί·

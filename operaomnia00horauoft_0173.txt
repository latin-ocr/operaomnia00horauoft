GARMINUM III. 3. 143

Augustus, and the speeeh is not destitufieoftnehoratorieal power as the oeseadmiwed of.
It also contains indireet exhortations to ahsfinenee und eontentment, sud so bears on the
general scope of these odes. Suetonius, in his life of Julius Caesar (ο. 79), says it was
v generally reported he meant to mussei- the seat of empire to Alexandria (in Troas pro-

bably, not the Egyptian city) or to nium. Lucan asu-ibes to him the same intention, and
makes him say (ix. 997),

“ Restituam populos ε grata viee moenia reddent
Ausonidae Phrygibus, Romanaque Pergama surgent.'’

not considered too absurd to be spoken of. We lmow when the abaudonment of the
mother city for Veii had its advocates, who were not influenoed solely by the superior
mationa of the city bnt by dislike to the institutions of Rome, and laws which oonld
only be got rid of by such a change. We ean emsily believe that in Horaoe's time among
the remedius proposed for the evils of the stato some may have freely spoken of trans-
ferring the seat of government to another spot, and that the site of Troy, the city of their
nucesmrs and the fountain of their raoe, may have been fixed upon sor that purpose. To
meet the spirit of avariae in some, and restlessness in all that would bemixed up with such
a notion, seems to have been Horaoe’s purpose. One of Orelli's Berne MSS. has this
inscription, ‘³ Ad Musas de Augusto qui in proposito videtur perseverare‚” as if Augustus
had entertained a desire and intention like the above, and some commentatore have taken
up that notion. If it had been the ease there is no h'kelihood that Hor-aee would have
'taken this oeension and means of dissuading him. 1 believe, as 1 nid before, he wrote
these odes, ifnot by the emperor’s desire, to seeund his efforts and with his spproval.

The words in which J nstin describes the meefing of the Roman soldiers with the people -

of the Troud, when Scipio lauded in Asia in his expedition against Antiochus, are worth
quoting. He says: “ Cum igitur ab utrisque bellum pararetur ingressiqueAsiam Romani
nium venissent, mutua gratulatio Iliensium ac Romanorum fuit 3 Iliensibus Aeneam
eetoeosque cum eo dnoes ι se profectos, Romanis se ab his procreatos referentibus3 tan-
· uque laetius omnium fuit quanta esse post longum tempus inter parentes et liberos solet.
Juvuhut Dienses nepotes suos Occide-to et Asties domita Asiam ut avitum regnum vindi-
care, optabilem Trojae ruinam fuisse dieentes, ut tam felieiter renasceretur ε eontra
Romanos avitos lares ut incunabula majorum, templaque ac deorum simulam-a inexple-
bile desiderium videndi tenebat ” (31. 8).

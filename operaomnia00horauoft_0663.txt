derived, asin other cases, rather from the
disdple than the founder of the school,
whose contempt sor sensual pleasurae, and
stern opposition to the sels· indulgent spirit
of his age, and especially of the Cyrenaic
school (whatever defects os judgment he
may have shown), place him very high in
⁷ the history of Greek philosophy. The
Cynic- received their name from the place
where Antisthenes taught, the Cynosarges,
a gymnasium at Athens.

19. Sem-mr eqo ipre mihi‚] This verb
does not ooeur elsewhere. The participle
, is used in the next Epistle (v. 2). Aristip-
pus ia suppooedto parry the blow (‘e1udere,¹
a metaphor taken from the gladiators) of
Diogenes thus, by admitting, for the sake
of argument, that he acted parasite to a
king3 yet it was for his own advantage3
whereas the Cynic acted paroeite to the po-
pulace' for their amusement3 he begged
their dirty provisions, and gave them snarl-
ing jests in return3 and by accepting their
alms he acknowledged himself their inferior,
and this though he pmfaesed to want nothing
of them or any one else. Diogenes is said
by his biographer and namaegake to have
been reduced to begging by poverty. Itis
more probable he was a beggar on principle,
considering the possession of property to be
an nnphilogsophical indulgence. ‘Hoc’ (v.
19) refers to the remoter object, as in S. 1i.
2. 29, where see note. On ‘equus me
portet, alat rex,' the Scholiasts quote a
Greek proverb: ἵππος με φέρει, βασιλεύς
με τρέφει. It occurs in the Παροιμίαι of
Diogenianns, a grammarian in the time of
Hadrian, who compiled a lexicon, of which
a collection of proverbs formed part. He
says the words were first uttered by a sol-
dier of Philip of Macedon to his mother,
who entreated him to ask exemption from

service. ‘Officium' is commonly applied

rerum,’ see C. iv. 12. 19, n. S. ii. 8. 83.
Lambinus first introduced this reading stom
some of his MSS„ which have been con-
firmed by many since. The Scholiasta
Porphyrion and Comm. Cruq. had ‘viliaz
verum es’ and nearly all the old editions
have that reading, which Torrentius also
follows and Dacier. The only modern edi-
tor who does so is Pes, and he defends it
on the authority of many MSS. and of the ⁷
Scholiasta. 1 have no doubt the reading of
the text is right. It is in Horace’s way, as
will be seen in the above places.

23. Omnia Aristippum decuit color] See
Epp. i. 1. 13, n. ⁸ Color' is ‘ color vitae '
(S. ii. l. 60), and corroeponds to ‘vitae
via ’ below (v. 26). We use ‘ complexion'
in the same double sense.

25. duplici panno] Τ118 asceticism of
Diogenes was his way of carrying out the
principle of endurance, which was a chief
feature in his teacher’s system. A coarse
‘ abolla,’ a gai-ment thrown loosely over tho
person, served him for his dress, without
tunic. He is said to have been the first to
wear it double and to have slept in it, and
those who followed him, adopting the same
practice, were called διπλοείματοι and
ἀχίτωνες. Juvenal say 3 the Stoica differed
from the Cynioe only m the nse of the tunic
(S. xiii. 121). “Vel Stoica dogmata legit
A Cynicis tunica distantia?

28. celeber-rima per loca] See C. ii. 12.
20, n.

30. Alter Mileti textam] The purple
and wool of Miletus were held in great
eeteem by the Greeks. As to ⁴ chlamys‚’
see Epp. i. 6. 40, n. It appears that there
were several stories current among the
ancients about the indifference os Aristip-

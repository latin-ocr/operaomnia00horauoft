trade thoe, and was surrounded with shops
established for the benefit of the spectatore.
The (xxm Maximus was called Circus
κατ’ ἐξοχὴν. When there were no races
or gamen going on, it was probably sre-
quentedas alounge byall manner of
people. 1 know no other way of explaining
Horace's words. There could be nothing
iuhisgoingtothecircusasaspectator
of the gamos, which all did; but probably
meu of consequence did not care to be seen
there among the vulgar at other timos.
The Forum was not frequented in the even-
ing by the richer class of people, who were
then ean'ng their dinner. Horace liked to
stroll out at that honr, and take his light
'moal asterwards, and to stop and hear what
tho fortunetellers had to say for themselves.
'Respecfing these persons, see C. i. ll, In-
troduction.

115. Aa pom· et ciceris] This Pytha-
gorean meai of leeks, pulse, and fritoers,
was partly perhaps matter of choice, and
partly of necessity. Horace was poor at
this time, and his health was indifferent.
A vegetable diet was and is much more
common in Italy than with us3 and probably
the most luxurious of the Romans, when by
themselves, frequently abstained from meat.
A dish of ⁸ cicer‚’ ready boiled, was sold in
the sta-oeta for an as in the time of Mar»
>tid gi. 1⁰4. 10) : “Asse cicer tepidum con-
retat. ¹ A vegetable dinner, with a great

' variety of dishes, is described by Martial in
an invitation to affiend (v. 78). ‘ Imganus ’
is deso-iboni by tho Scholiasts as a flat thin

' cake, fried and eaten with condiments. It
was sometimes fried under roast meat or
fow1s, so as to get their dripping, and so
would be like our Yorkshire padding.
Horace had no doubt the plainer sort.

116. pueris tribum] This number was
§aa lowest probably that at that time waited

· (See above, on v. 108.) ⁴ Lapis albus’
'aa a small side-table of white marble.
'flia wenlthy Romans had a great variety of
tablea of the handsomest sort in their
dining rooms for exhibiting their plate-
(See below, S. ii. 4, n.; and above, S. 3.

13, n.) An the plata Horace had to show
was two cups and a us (C. iii. 19. 12),
and these it is probable were usually empty.
Fea says that *lapis albus' dooe not mean
a table, but a slab with holes, in which the
cups (whose bottonis, he says, were round,
and so not suited to standing on a plain
surface) were placed. It was called by the
Greeks ἐγγυθήκη (Athen. viii. 5), by the
Romans ‘ incitega‚' a corruption of the same
word. (Forcell. has given a very far-fetched
derivation to this word.) This slab Fea
says was supported by another below it,
the upper one being called *basiae the
other ‘ hypobasis,’ as appears in an inscrip-
tion he quotes fmm Gruter, which recorda
the presentation to Hercules of ‘⁴ caa-
rmuu. anovaocommruau. cum. nasa.
stu. Er. nYPonAsr. uanuonufl
there is not enough in what he says to fix
this meaning on ‘lapis albus) which Ι
should not have notioed if Orelli had not
adopted Fea's explanation. The ‘ echinus ’
is a vessel no where else mentioned by that
name, and it would be tiroeome to the
render if 1 were to go through all that the
mmmentators have said upon the subject.
The Scholiasts give us the choice between a
salt-cellar (in the shape of an ¹ echinus ’), a
glass bottle, a leather bottle, and a wooden
bowl in which to wash the cups. This laet
is the explanation adopted by Heindorf.
Cruquius says, “ locus obscurus est et ipso
echino spinosior.” Fea contends for the
salt-cellar, thinking Horace could not omit
all mention of that. (See S. 3. 14, n.)
Some MSS„ according to Lambinus, have
‘echium’ making ‘vilis' agree with the
following substantives. I am not aware
that they are entitled to any weight, but
Gesner edits ⁴ echino! ‘ Paterae' were
broad flat saucer-shaped cups, and were
much used in libations. ⁴ ‘ Guttus' was a
long thin-necked bottle from which wine or
oil was poured very slowly, drop by drop.
It was also used in libations, and these two
vessels, as here joined, have reference to
the practice of offering a libation at every
meal to the ‘ lares! See C. iv. 5, n. These
were of the commonest earthenware which
came from Campania. See S. ii. 3. 144.

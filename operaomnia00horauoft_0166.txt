Q. HORATH FLAGGI

CARMINUM

LIBER TERTIUS.

CARMEN Ι.

About A.U.c. 728.

Tms and the five following odes are generally admitted to be among the finest speci·
mens of Horace's manner, and it appears to me that in this didactic style he shows moetos
his own character and genius. It is, as far as we know, entirely his own. There is no opi-
nion from which 1 more entirely dissent than this of anke, ‘⁴ Tota Horatii poesis lyrica
et ex ipsius sententia dici et haberi potest amatoria'’ (F. H. p. 57). And Buttmann’s
sentence, which goes into the other extreme, appears to me as far from the irath, unless
he limits it, as 1 believe he really meant to do, to the style that Franke thinks his mongoeu
⁴⁴ Non-reality,'' he sayS, ‘⁴ is an essential feature of Horaoe’s odes.” The fact appears to
be, that reality was so much a part of Horace's mind, that he was never so great as when
he wrote on some real subject, something that drew out his sound common sense, his

regard for a friend, his sense of right, his appreciation of mmm, and his feelings in -

respect to the times he lived in and especially the condition of Rome itself. It is this
that gives to the six odes with which the third book opens the force and charin we find in
them. It has been already said (C. ii. 15, Introduction) that they appear all to have
been written about the same time with one another and with other odes, namely, that
time when Augustus set himself the task of social reformation after the elom of the civil
wars. .
The general purport of this ode is an exhortation ω moderate living and desii-es.

The first stanza is generally understood to have been added as an introductioni to ‘the
six odes, viewed as a whole.

ARGUMENT.

The worldly 1 despise, but have new preoepts for the young.
Kings rule over their people, but are themselves the subjects of Jove. One may be
richer, another nobler than his feIIows, but all alike must die. No indulgence can get

sleep for him who has a sword ever hang-ing over him, while it disdains nottho dwellings ,

of the poor. He who in content with a little fears not storin or drought. The rich
man builds him houses on the very waters, but anxiety follows him go where he will.
If then marble and purple, rich wines and costly perfumes, cure not grief, why should
I build me great houses, or exchange for the burthen of riches my humble Sabine
farm ἓ

ODI profanum vulgus et arceo ;
Favete linguis: earmina non prius
Audita Musarum sacerdos
Virginibus puerisque canto.

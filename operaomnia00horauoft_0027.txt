'.' 'rho life of Horace was written by Porphyrion, the Seholiast fre-
- quently referred to in these notes. He mentions that memoir himself:

s» “2an libertino natum esse Horatium et in narratione quam de vita
Α, ipsius habui ostendi’' (on S. i. 6. 41). This same Scholiast refers more
’ than once to books that had been written on the persons mentioned by
-. Horace. A reference to Estre’s work spoken of in the Preface will

show that a catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin-
guished men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly

. verm..

Tho Matres adopted by Horace from the Greek are thirteen in num-
ber in the Odes and six in the Epodes. I purpose saying only a few

“ words on each.

· thus ι

0. i. L-—The metre of this Ode is one of three, called after Ascle-
piades‚a lyric poet of uncertain date. It consists of single lines divided

’ἵ 'l'he caesura usually falls at the end of the second foot. There are two
' exceptions only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did
J not follow this rule, and their lines ‘were less monotonous in con-

 

· nequeuce. The division of this metre by choriambics is against the ⁴
-“ obvious rhythm. O. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to the same.

ζ, O. i. 2.—-This metre takes its name from Sappho. It consists of
= stmzas of four verses each. The three first are alike‚ and consist of
f, four trochees, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always sub-

„J stitutes a spondee for the second trochee, with one uncertain exception,

C. S. ¹70. The fourth verse consists of a dactyl and spondee.
This is one of the commonest metres. It differs in Horace’s hands
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trochee

χ in the second place, and from the caesura usually falling aster the fifth

 

, syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from the vigour of
’ the mette, a defect which Horace seems to have perceived when he
wrote the Carmen Seculare and the Sapphic Odes of the fourth book ⁷.

- on Dr. euey’s “Latin Prosody made Easy.” The author observes: “ It greatly oon-

ινα-,η common opinion. To which the reviewer replies: ‘⁸ To our curs the latter is at
, lust ns melodious as the former, consisting of a dactyl interposed between two acoentual
maheu, as in the lines quoted by ΒΞ. Carey from Catullus and Sappho:

⁶ ποικιλόθρον’ ἀθάνατ’ Ἀφροδίτα]

⁴ Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ς’

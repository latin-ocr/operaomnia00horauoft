Tu separatis uvidus in jugis '

Tu, cum parentis regna per arduum
Cohors Gigantum scanderet impia,
Rhoetum retorsisti leonis

Pugnae ferebaris : sed idem
Pacis eras mediusque belli.

says Ec. iv. 30) : “ Et durae quercus suda-
bunt roscida mella.''

12. iterare] Forcellini does not notice
this instance,but quotes others from Plautus,
and one from Gellius (referred to by Orelli),
in which ‘itero ’ signifies ‘ to relate.' The
sense in those cases is, going over again in
narrative what had passed in action. Here,
1 think, it is repeating what the poet had
heard from the god as he taught the Nymphs
to praise him. -

13. beatae conjuyis] i.e. Ariadne, whose
crown is one of the constellations, ‘ corona,’
placed in heaven by Bacchus, according to
the story recorded in his happy manner by
Ovid (Fast. iii. 459-‘516).

14. tectaque Penthei] So Euripides of
the same person (Bacch. 363) 2-

Βάκχιος-
&nigras ἕρῤηξεν χαμᾶζε· συντεθράνωται
απαν-

17. Tu flecti-s· amne-sn] ΤΙιε Hydaspes
and Orontes which Bacchus is said to have
walked over dryshod.

19. Nodo coerces] This is a variation
of ‘ nodo cohibere crinem ' (C. iii. 14. 2³2).
The Bistones were a Thracian tribe. For
other instances of ‘fraus‚' in this sense of
barm, see Forcell. It occurs again C. S. 41.

21. Tu, cum parentis] Horace followed
some legend not found by us elsewhere in
this description of Bacchus changed into a
lion and fighting with Rhoetus, whose name
is Rhoecus in the editions of Lambinus and

oldest Blandinian MS.), Baxter, Dacier,
and some others, as from Ῥοῖκος, who how·-
ever was a Centaur. But all the best MSS.
(with the above exception, and there Rhoe-
cus is 'a corrected reading), and all the old
editions (according to Jani3 of the fifteenth
century 1 have only had acoess to the Vene-
tian reprint of Landinus, 1483, which has
Rhethum) have Rhoetum, or other forms
with ¹ t.’ See Bentley’s note, which is very
long. He suspects ‘ horribilis ’ to be the true
reading. But none of the MSS. support him.
28. Pacis erae mediusque bellan] = For-
cellini does not throw much light upon this
expression by saying that ⁴ medius ³ is one,
“ qui ad duas res contrarias aeque aptus
est,'' or by quoting Livy (i. 32), “ Medium
eratin Anco ingenium et Numae et Romuli
memor.’' Dillenbr. says “Medius pacis et
belli appellatur deus sua natura neutri parti
deditus, sed ut tempus fert modo bellicosus
modo pacis amans ;'’ and quotes Epp. i.
18. 9 ε “ Virtus est medium vitiorum et,
utrinque reductum.” 1 think it means you
were the same whether engaged in (in the
midst of) peace or wax-3 the same, i.e. as

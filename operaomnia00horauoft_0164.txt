HORATII FLAGOI

N on usitata nec tenui ferar

l. Non usitata] Aristophanes makes the
poet Cinesias say (Av. 1372):—
ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον πτερύγεσσι

κούφαις.

On the meaning of ‘ biformis’ the interpre-
ters are not agreed. Horace cau only mean
as swan and poet.

4. invidia major] Horace was not too
good to be maligned, but he could rise above
it, which is the meaning of ‘major,’ κρείσ-
σων. His birth drew contempt upon him
while he held a command in Brutus’ army,
and afterwards when he became intimate
with Maecenas (see Sat. i. 6. 46, sqq.) ; but
those who envied tried as usual to make use
of him (see Sat. ii. 6. 47, sqq.). He appears
in some measure to have outlived detrac-
tion {according to his own words (C. iv.

“ Jam dente minus mordeor invido.''

6. Quem voca-ed See Introduction. Τ11εε
Scholiasts separated ‘dilecte,’ from Mae-
cenas, understanding the construction to
be “quem vocas ‘dilecte,’'’ as in Ovid
(Am. i. 7. 19):

‘⁴ Quis mihi non demens, quis non mihi
barbare dixit ?’'

The supporters of this interpretation also
quote Luke vi. 46: τί με καλεῖτε Κὺ-
ριε; but there is no necessity for taking
the word from the substantive it would most
naturally agree with. Bentley suspects the
true reading to be ‘vocant’ instead of ‘vocas‚'
and applies it to the preceding words,
⁸ pauperum sanguis parentum,’ as ‘⁶ quom

rodunt omnes libertino patre natum '' (Sat.
i. 6. 46) 3 but there is no authority or reason
for this change. It was on the strength of
such invitations that he affirmed—

- “ pauperemque dives
Me petit’' (C. ii. 18. 10).

11.· Supeme‚] As this is formed stom
¹ supernus,' the last syllable would naturally
be loug3 but it is short in Lueretius twice,
and the same with ⁴ inferne! It may there-
fore be short here3 and there is no neces-
sity for departing, as Fea does, stom the
reading of the best MSS„ aud taking ⁴⁸11-
perna' from a few. Foroeuini observo-that
some MSS. have ‘apprimc,’ with tha last·
syllable short, in Virgil (Georg. ii. 134 ),
“ Flos apprime tenax,’' which is generally
written ‘ apprime!

13. Daedaleo ocior] Orelli has collected
many examples of hiatus like this imm
Horace, Virgil, and Ovid. Iu Horace, see
C. i. 28. 24. Epod. v. 1003 xiii. 3. 'nie

oldest Berne and Ziirich MSS. have ‘notior’ ,

and ‘ nocior,’ which last is au evident· cor-
rupu'on of tho tmo reading. Bentley eon-
jectures ⁴ tutior!
15. canorus Ales]
‘⁴ O mutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cycni si libeat sonum.”
(C. iv. 3. 19, sq.)

‘⁴ Multa Dircaeum levat aura cycnum.”
(C. iv. 2. 25.)

The bird therefore that Horace means can-
not be mismken. Virgil (Ee. ix. 27) hu—

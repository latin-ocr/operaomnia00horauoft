Nunc decet aut viridi nitidum eaput impedire myrto

Aut flore terrae quem ferunt solutae.

Nunc et in umbrosis Fauno decet immolare lueis,
Seu poscat agnam sive malit haedum.
Pallida Mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas

Regumque turres.

and path-bility 'n greatly in favour of the
latter. Why should tho copyisoe have
would be intelligible. That it is said of
Vmus (Ο. iii. 28. 15). “Paphon junctis
visit oloribus‚” is no argument at all. Ovid
(Fut. iv. 473) has “Antraque Cyclopum,
positis Ἔα aminis? which was possibly
imitated m s.

’ 11. Fauno decet immolare] Τῑιο Fauna-
lia took place on the Ides of December.
But a loeser festival was observed on the
Ides of Fe , at the advent of Faunus
(Pan, the two being, as is well known,
identified by the later Romans. See Dict.
Myth.) See Ο. iii. 18. Ovid, Fast. ii. 193 :
‘⁴ Idibus agmen sumant altaria Fauni?
ᾼῢ that fimo the flocks and herds went out
to grate, and the god m invoked for their
protection. ‘ Immolare’ admits of two
constructions: with an amative, as (Livy
xli. 14) “immolantibus J ovi singulisbubus,”
and with an accusative, as (Virg. Aen. x.
519) ‘⁸ inferias quas immolet umbris.”
Horace himself has the latter construction
elsewhere (S. ii. 3. 164): ‘⁴ Immolet aequis
hic pormm Laribus? So Virgil (Ecl. iii.
77), ‘⁴ facias vitula.’' Servius quotes this
passage as having the ablative case of the
victim. But it appears (according to Orelli,
who however-has ⁵ agna ' and ‘ haedo ’) that

α , ἰιι the *ables of the Fratres Arvalae the accu-

sativeis usedwith ⁴ immolare‚’ and the abla-
tive with ‘facere3’ aud the reason is ob-
vienn thelame is an elliptical expression
in which ⁴ mum’ is understood, as Fea
remarks. The MSS. vary. If the accusa-
tive be the true reading, as 1 believe it is,
the ablah‘ve may have got into the MSS.
without any remarkable oversight ; ⁶ agnam '
would be written ⁴ agni) and ‘ haedom ’ (for
⁴ haedum ’) would be written ‘ haedo! These
marks were frequently omitted through
haste or carelessness, and I am inclined to

think such ww the case iu this instance.
Ven. has ‘ aguam ' and ‘aedos,' where it
exemere&
omitted it iu the second, and that the editor
added the ⁴ s ' to ⁴ haedo ς’ or that this had
been done by the copyist of the MS. he fol-
lowed. Most of the modern editors have
adopted the reading with the ablative.
Lambinus has the accusative, which is ap-
prqged pulsaeby Rulgasgvgid, Hei-oid. xxi. 4⁶,
‘¹ Persephone nostras pulsat acerba ἴοι-αἶ’

14. Reqee] This word is commonly ap-
plied to the rich by Horace, and by Terence
too, as Phormio (i. 2. 20) ε “ Oh ! regem me
oese oportuit.'’v Sestius was a favourite of

For-tune, as a referenceto his life will show. >

‘⁴ Beatus dicitnr qui multa habens sine malo .

aliquo degit” is Cicero’s definition.

16. premet] From this word which be-
longs more properly to ‘ nox‚' we must
understand appropriate words for ⁸ Manoe'
and ⁸ domus! Orelli supplioe ⁴ circumvoli-
tabunt' and ‘ teget!

fabulaeque Manem] This is explained by
Juv. S. ii. 149:—

“ Esse aliquid (or aliquos) Manes

Nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere
lavantur?

 

Horace may have had in mind the following
epigram of Callimachus :—

ὧ Χσρίδα, τί τὰ νέρθε; πολὺ σκότος· ai δ’
ἄνοδοι τί ;

ψεῦδος· ὀ δὲ Πλούτωνς μῦθος· ἀπωλόμεθα.

Persius has imitated Horace, S. v. 152:

‘¹ cinis et Manes et fabula fies.” ⁴ Fabulae’

therefore signifiae ⁵ unreaL’ Propert. on

the contrary says (iv. 7. 1), ‘⁸ Sunt aliquid

Manem letum non omnia finit.”—· Exilis’ is “

variously interpreted, either as ⁴ bare,’ as it
is in Epp. i. 6. 45: “ Exilis domus est qua
non et multa supersunt,” or ‘ shadowy‚'
or ⁴ narrow,’ meaning the grave, which is
called ‘ Leti domus,' ⁴ Ditis aeterna domus’
in an ancient epitaph given at length by
Rutgersius in his Lect- Venus. He under-

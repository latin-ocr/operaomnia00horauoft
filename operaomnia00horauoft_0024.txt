xviii INTRODUGTION.

but there ie so much affinjty between the Are Poetiea affl the apinae
10 Augustus that I believe they were written at no great interval of
time. It seems from the Epistle to Florus that Horace atffhis time
had to resist the urgency of friends begging him to write, one in this

style and another 111 that, and that 110 had no desire to gratify them and ι

10 sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he never took
any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less energy, as his life
was drawing prematurely to a close through infirmities either contracted
or aggravated during his 111-1111011111 campaigning with Brutus, his inapti-
tude for which he appears afterwards to have been perfectly aware of.
He continued to apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place, according to Eusebius, on the 2'7th November,
auc. 7 46, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a few days of
its completion. Maecenas died the same year, also towards the close of
it ; a coincidence that has led some to the notion that Horace hastened
his own death that he might not have the pain of surviving his patron.
According to Suetonius his death (which he places aster his fifty—ninth

year) was so sudden that he had not time to execute his will, which is ¹

opposed to the notion of suicide. The two friends were buried near
one another “ in extremis Esquiliis, ’' in the farthest part of the Esqui-
liae, that 1s probably without the city walls, on the ground drained and
laid out m gardens by Maecenas.

The plan adopted 111 11110 Edition, of commenting on each poem in a
separate Introduction, renders it unnecessary to say much' 111 this place ,
upon Horace' s style and character. The particular style in which ‚his
principal strength lay will be always matter of opinion. My own is that
he is nowhere so great as 'in the Odes‚ and that of these his genius is
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men,‘while, in some
of the small occasional pieces‚ as the Ode to the Fountain of Bandusia,
that on the death of Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are shown. I cannot at all agree with those who think that amatory
verse-writing was Horace’s strong point. With rare exceptione his
compositions of this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
and passionless, bearing the stamp of imitation, with unequivocal signs
of art, and none of nature. The crowd of mistresses that have been

gathered for him out of his poems is beyond belief ; and the 111110110υο .

folly that has tried to classify his amours, and to follow chronologi-
cally the shifting of his affections‚ I have had occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon an interpretation of the Odes which is foreign to

their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentious pro· ·

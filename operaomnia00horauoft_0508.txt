HORATII FLACCI

Rex sum. Nil ultra quaero plebeius. Et aequam
Rem imperito ; ac si cui videor non justus, inulto

Dicere quod sentit permittO.

Maxime regum, 190

Di tibi dent capt-a classem deducere Troja Ξ
Ergo consulere et mox respondere licebit?

Consule.

Cur Ajax, heros ab Achille secundus,

Putescit toties servatis clarus Achivis,

Gaudeat ut populus Priami Priamusque inhumato,

Per quem tot juvenes patrio caruere sepulcro ἓ
Mille ovium insanus morti dedit, inclitum Ulixen

Sed quo cecidit (Sejanus)
sub crimine? quisnam

Delator? quibus indicibus, quo teste pro-

Nilliblxiiim : verbosa et grandis epistola venit

A Capreis. Bene habet3 nil plus interrogo.'’

 

Bentley, mistaking the connexion, and
missing the force of the parenthetical humi-
lity of the second speaker, reads‘ quaere'
against the metre, but on the authority of
the oldest Β1811111111811 MS. As the king
immediately goes on to invite comment we
need not make him stultify himself by here
refusing to listen to it. Stephens quotes a
Greek proverb, μώρῳ καὶ βασιλεῖ νόμος
ἄγραφος, ‘fools 81111 1111138 are governed by
811 unwritten law! And Juvenal s‘ ‘Sic volo
sic jubeo; stat pro ratione voluntas” (vi.
223) will occur to every body y.

191. Di tibi dent capta classem deducere
Troja J] This is aversion of Chryses' words
,to the king (11. i. 18):

ὑμῖν μὲν Θεοὶ δοῖεν Ὀλύμπια δώματ’
&gaigal-aec Πριάμοιο πόλιν, εὖ δ’ οἴκαδ’
meo αι.

Three of Orelli’s best MSS„ 81111 many
others, have‘ redducere, ' which Lambinus
and all the editions after him till Bentley
adop ted. Heindorf has done the same.
The old editions (Ven. 1483, 81111 Α888118.
15ll)have⁸ deducere) which ,independently
of the quantity, is the word required. ‘Re-
ducere' can only be said in the country
to which the retum 18 to take p.lace ‘Con-
sulm-e,' as Orelli says, is used Ρ111111101011817,
as if the person addressed was a juriscon-
sultus. On ‘respondere ' see C. S. 55, 11.
194. Putescit] The two forms ‘pu-
trescere ' and ‘ patescere ' are in use, and a
difference of meaning is assigned to them,
as if ‘putescere ’ meant to rot and emit a
steneh3 the other simply to go to decay.
There is no probability in such distinctions.

The old editions, with Lambinus, Torren-
tius, and Bentley, have ‘putrescit' here.
The majority and best of the MSS. are in
favour of ‘ putescit! I do not think itis easy
todecide. The instances οἱ* putesco' quoted
by Forcellini are all doubtful, according to
the MSS.; but the word flows naturally
from‘ puteo,' and the root 18 the 881118 111
both verbs. Orelli says that the 1118881113
of both is the same, but that· putesco’ is
used because it is softer. Bnt‘ p'utrescat
is used above (v. 119), 81111 the instances ha
quotes,‘increbuit' ῐοτ*1118181111111,”1·11-
besco' for‘ rubresco,' are not to the pur-
pose, since in both those cases the sostei·
form is apparently adopted in order to
avoid the double ‘r.' (See Mr. Long's
noteonCic. inVerr. ii. 2. 3, 81111 S. ii. 5. 93.)

195. Gaudeat utpopulnsPriamiPriamm-
que] Comp. 11. i. 255. ἦ κεν γηθήσαι
Πρίαμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες.

197. Mille ovium] ‘⁸ ‘Mine’ 111 the
singular· 18 commonly an adj ecfive3 in the
plural perhaps always 8 substantive’· (Key's
L. G. 1064). An exception to the latter
part of this rule has been noticed above
(S. i. 6. 111). Gellius (i. 16) has men-
tioned instances in which, as here, ‘mills,'
the singular, is used 88 8 1101111 substantive.
He takesashis textapassage orandi-iga-
rius (Annal. iii.): “Ibi occiditur 1111118 110-
minum, ” and quotes Lucilius (Sat. iii.). ,

“Ad portum mille a porta est, sex *inda
Salernum. '’ Varro (Human. xviii.)· “Ad
Romuli initium plus mille et centum an-
norum 881.” Cato (01·13. i.:) “Inde est
ferme mille passuum] ’Cicero (Phil. vi. 5):

“Janus medius (v. sup. v. 18) in L. An-
tonii clientela est? Quis unquam 111 ullo
Jano inventus est qui L. Antonio 1111118
nummum ferret expensum?” He quotes
other instances, and concludes that the
Romans used‘ 1111118,’ not as χίλιοι, but as

χιλιάς. Lucilius, in two passages quoted
by Gellius, usaethe ablativo 8111311181· 1111111;’

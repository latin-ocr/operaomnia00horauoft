12. Emancipatus] There is no varia-
tion in the MSS. here, but the sense would
seem to require ⁴ mancipatus.' ⁴⁴ ⁴ Manci-
patio ' 18 the form by which a person who
was not ⁴ sui juris' was transferred to the
⁴ potestas ' of another,as in the case of adop-
tion. ‘Emancipare' seems to be the proper
term to express the making a person ‘sui
juris 'by the aet of‘ mancipatio, but‘ man-

c. Χῖ. “Si nemini mancipata est.' ') See
also, by the same author, art. ‘Mancipiumss
Smith’ s Dict. Ant. Here, however, we must
take ⁴ emancipatus ' as the true reading, and
it can only signify ⁴ sold into 8 .' ’ There
may be a shade of difference ' e meaning
of the words which it is not to trace.
The instances quoted by Orelli from Plautus
(Bacchid. i. 1. 58),⁴ ‘tibi me emanciposs'
and Cicero (Phil. ii. 21),ι ‘venditum atque
emancipatum tribunatum,’ ’' are very sus-
picions: in each ease ⁴ emancipe ’ follows a
word whose last letter is ⁴ e.'

16. compium] A gauze musquito cnr-
tain. Some MSS. have ⁴conopeum,' and
so Lambinus and Crnquius. The Greek is
κωνωπεῒον, 81111 according to analogy it
would be written κωνώπων if they wished
to shorten the penult, as κηρύκειον, κηρύ-
κιον, &c., on which grounds Bentley says
that it should be written ⁴ conopium’ or
⁴ conopeum,' according as the penult is
short or long. It is long in Juvenal (Sat.

vi. 80): ⁴⁴ Et testudineo tibi, Lentule,
conopeo.’' In Propert. (iii. 11:45) it is
short: ⁴⁴ Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere

saxo.’'

17. At huc] The MSS. vary so much
that the true reading is very difficule to
determine. Τ118 greater number of MSS„

and all the older editions, have ‘ad hnnc,'
which is the reading followed by the Scho-

liasts Acron and Porphyrion, though Bent-
ley, by not quoting the latter correctly,

makes him favour 1118 reading, ‘ad hoc!
‘Ad hunc' is rendered⁴ against him: that
is, Antonius, who has not been men’tioned
but is sufficiently implied 111- 018 preceding
verses. But ‘ad hunc' will not bear this
meaning, or at any rate the sentence would
be most obscure. Orelli and Diuenbr„ de-
serting the MSS„ adopt the conjecture of
Fea, ‘at hoc,' and join ‘hoc' with ‘'fre-
mentes! It appears to me to give but a
lame sentence, and I prefer following good
MSS. to adopting this conjecture. ‘At
huc ' were the words Cruquius' commentator
had before him, and Cruquius found them
in two of his MSS„ 81111 111 others aa a
various reading. Orelli mentions others
that have the same. ⁴ Huc? as Cmquins
81111 1118 Scholiast remark, means ‘to our
side,' 118 Velleius (ii. 84) says, “Hinc ad
Antonium nemo, illinc ad Caesarem quoti-

die aliquid transfugiebatl' ‘Fremantea’

will then go with‘ eq uos, ’to which it ap-

pears naturally to belo‘iag ⁴Hoc fremenm'

‘canentes Caesarem,y 801111118 awkward, and ”

the idea 18 strained. Horace only 1118811810

to Caesar,—a fact which was no doubt in
every body's mouth at the time. For the ex-
pression ‘canentes Caesarem' compare Vir-g.
(Aen. vii. 698): ⁴⁴ Ibant aequati numero
regemque canebant.'’ The ⁴ Gauls' were
cavalry of Galatia (or Gallograecia) under
Deiotarus their king, and his general (who
afterwards succeeded him) Amyntas. See
Juv. (vii. 16): “Altera quos nudo traducit
Gallia talo.'’

20. sinistrorsum citae] The meaning
of these words is very obscure, and 1 be-
lieve we require 10 know more than we do

208 HORATII

FLACGI

Unde quo veni? Levis una mors est

Virginum culpae.

Vigilansne ploro

Turpe commissum, an vitiis carentem

Ludit imago
Vana quae porta fugiens

- Sonmium ducit? Meliusne fluctus
Ire per longos fuit an recentes

Carpere flores ἓ

Si quis infamem mihi nunc juvencum 45
Dedat iratae lacerare ferro et
Frangere enitar modo multum amati

Cornua monstri.

Impudens liqui patrios Penates,

Impudens Orcum moror.

Si quis haec audis, utinam inter errem

Nuda leones !

Antequam turpis macies decentes
Occupet malas teneraeque sucus
Defluat praedae, speciosa quaero

but ‘ What an exchange have Ι made l So
dear a home for this strange place l ’ It is au
very natural and beautiful. ‘ Una mors' is
perhaps an imitation of Sophocles' (Antig.
308) οὐχ ὗμιν ’Ἀιόης μοῦνος ἀρκέσει.
Propertius repeats the words (iv. 4. 17) =
‘¹ Et satis una malae potuit mors esse puel-
lae.'’ For ⁴ virginum' Markland= for ⁴ vitiis’
Bentley, proposes the singular number. The
corrections are unnecessary.

41. porta suyiens eburna] This is the
welliknown image of Homer (odyss. xix.
562 ,-

δοιαὶ γάρ τε πύλαι ἀμενηνῶν εἰσὶν ὀνεί·
ρων·

αἱ μὲν γὰρ κεράεσσι τετεύχαται αὶ δ’ ἐλέ-
φαντι·

τῶν οἳ μέν κ’ ἔλθωσι διὰ πριστοῦ ἐλέ-
φαντος,’

ο“ι’ ῥ’ ἐλεφαίρονται ἔπε’ ἀκράαντα φέροντες·

οἳ δὲ διὰ ξεστῶν κεράων ἔλθωσι θυραζε,

οἵ ῤ’ ἔτυμα κραίνουσι βροτῶν ὅτι κέν τις
ἴδηται.

Virgil’s imitation is also well known (Aen.
ἒὲξξὶΐέοεοᾳ.) 2 “ Sunt geminae Somni por·

48. Cornua monstrt] ‘Tauri’ is *the

reading of nearly all the earliest editions.
But Bentley adopts ‘ monstri‚'which is aup-
ported by all the Blandinian MSS„ and the
oldest Berne, and many others of the best
repute- The Ziirich has ⁴ tauri-⁹

49. Impudem liqui] ‘I had 110 01181110
when Ι lest my father’s house. Ῑ have uo
shame or 1 should not hesiiate to die‚'
either because she deser-ved to die, or be-
cause her chastity was in danger. ‘ Ormm
moror ' is equivalent to ‘ dubito mori,' like
Ovid (Heroid. ix. 146)= “Impia quid du·
bitas Deianira mori ;'' but it ia an unusual
form. Seeing nothing but death before her,
she prays to be killed at once rather than
die a lingering death by hunger, and go
down to Hades robbed of her beauty. Ι
find by Orelli’s and Dillenbr.'s notes
that this stanza has been abumd, and·
its omission proposed, because it is said to
be unnatural, which appears to me very
much opposed to the fact. The lang-uage
is natural, whether viewed with reference to
the horrors of a linger-ing death, or to the
pride of a young girl ‘m her good looks. It
is also Greek, and from the Greek it ia
probably imitated. See Soph. Ant. 817,

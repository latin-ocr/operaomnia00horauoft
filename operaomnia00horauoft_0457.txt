SATIRARUM I. 10.

Ergo non satis est risu diducere rictum

Auditoris (et est quaedam tamen hic quoque virtus).

Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia neu se

Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures; 10
Et sermone opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso,

‘Defendente vicem modo rhetoris atque poetae,

Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus atque

Extenuantis eas consulto. Ridiculum acri

Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res.15

Hoc stabant, hoc sunt imitandi; quos neque pulcher

own farne, and from several admirable lines
out of the mimes of his slave

and pupil Publius Syrus, which are still

⁷ ext-nt (though the collection that bears his

name—probably contains many linea that are
snt hie), we may believe that Laberius did
morning to raise the tone of these plays.
But, without meaning personally to dis-
mmmm-iter, Horace might very well

dmfliey theyoeuld not even have pretended to

ny that Horace speaks disparagingly of

'mimes‚ and draw inferencae from
flm fact adverse to his own judgment, they
appar to me to mistake themeaningofthis
pange. He gives Laberius as much praise
aa he gives Lucilius, and though that is
qualified praise the nature of the composi-
tions he chooe to employ himself on ren-
dered this unavoidable. There can be no
doubt that his wit would have adorned a
hig-her sphere of writing, if he had selected
it. Cicao, who writing to Cornificius (ad

9. Bet brevitate opum] The want of
this quality· ιιι Lucilius he condemns in S.
42, sqq. ‘Tristi’ signifiae‘ serious! ‘·De
fundente vicem: supporting the part, like
‘fungarvicecotis' (A.P. 3⁰4), and ‘actoris
partes chorus officiumque virile Defendat’
(ιν-193). On ⁴,modo' seeS.3.l2 The
conhimtion Horace commends is that of
tha mator sternly cr gravely rebuking vice,
of the humorous satirist (poetae) broadly

ridiculing it, and of the polished wit who,
instead of throwing himself with all his
strength upon his victim, substitutee sarcasm
for invective, and lets his power be ratha·
feltthanseen. Ostheee three the gravity
of stem reproof Horace estimates lowest,
saying that ridicule generally settlea ques-
tions of however grave importance better
and more decisively than severity. ⁸ Secare’
is used in the sense of‘ decidere’ ιιι Epp.
i. 16. 42: ‘Q‘uo multae magnaeque
secantur judice lites.’' Cicero (de Or. ii.
58) sayS, “ Est plane oratoris movere risum
——maxime quod tristitiam ac severum mitigat
etrelaxat odiosasque res saepe quas argu-
mentis dilui non facile est joco risuque
dissolvit.'’

16. Illi scripta quibus] See S. 4. 2, ιι.
‘Hoc stabant,’ ‘stood on this ground,’ as
‘hinc pendet: S. 4. 6.

18. Hermoqenee] See S.3.129‚n. ‘Simius
iste’ is said by the Senonum, with every
probability, to mean Demetrius, whom we
meet with below (v. 79) as an abuser of
Horace and (v. 90) as a trainer of ⁴ mimae,'
like Hermogenes with whom he is assodated.
We know nothing more of him. The
Scholiasts say he was called an ape because
ofthe shortnaesofhisstaturemdthe
deformity of his person. It may be doubted
whether that idea was not derived from
Aristophanee’ desa-iption ofCleigenes, Rau.
708, ὁ πίθηκός γ’ οὗτος Κλειγένης ὅ μικρός.
His only skill was to sing the love songs of
Calvus and Catullus (and to imitate them,
Acron adds, probably at a guaes). Horace
having mentioned the great masters of Greek
comedy, <annot help stepping out of his way
to aimablowatthesepitifulpersons,
Hermogenes and his ape. It has been
rightly observed that Horace does not mean

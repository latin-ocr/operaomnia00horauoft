HORATII FLAOOI

Ergo Quinctilium perpetuus sopor

Urget! oui Pudor et J ustitiae soror

Incorrupta Fides nudaque Veritas
Quando ullum inveniet parem?

Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,

Nulli flebilior quam tibi, Virgili.

Tu frustra pius heu non ita creditum
Poscis Quinctilium deos.

Quodsi Threicio blandius Orpheo

Auditam moderere arboribus fidem,

Non vanae redeat sanguis imagini,
Quam virga semel horrida

Non lenis precibus fata recludere

Nigro compulerit Mercurius gregi.

Durum ε sed levius fit patientia
Quidquid corrigere est nefas.

mentum autem justitiae est fides, id est
dictorum conventorumque constantia et ve-

8. inveniet] Most of the older editions
have ‘ invenient& but nearly all the MSS.
appear to have ¹ inveniet,' and Bentley has
shown, bya large number of instatnces, that
it is Horace's usual practice to have the verb
in the singular number after several sub-
stantives as here. He says that it is never
otherwise except in corrupt passages, which
is his usual way of begging the question.
In C. iii. 16. 7 all the MSS. have ‘risis-
sent!

ll. Tu frustra pius heu nonita cre-
ditum] ‘ It is vain, alas! that with pious
prayers thou dost ask the gods to restore
Quinctilius, whom thou didst entrust to
their keeping, but not on these terms' (i. e.
that they should take him away). Such is
Porphyrion’s explanation. Lambinus and
Graevius understood ‘ non ita creditum’ to
mean that he was not entrusoed to virgil
on such terms as that he was never to part
with him. I prefer the first; but it is not
easy to say which is right.

13. Quodsi] All the Berne MSS„ and
Cruquius’, and some others, have ⁴ quid si,’
which some editors adopt, with the usual

But ·’ quodsi’ is supported by good authority,
and most of the editors have adopted it. 1

15. imayini, ]‘ Imago’ was that unsub-

stantial body in which the soul was sup-
posed to dwyell after death, called by the ·
Greeks εἴδωλον. Such were the forms that
Aeneas saw and thought them substantial- —-

“ Et ni. docta comes tenues sine corpore
Admssffi volitare cava sub imagineformae,
Irruat et frustra ferro diverberet umbras.”

Aen. vi. 292, sqq.

17. Non lenis precibus sata recludere] 1
This Greek construction has been notioed j
before (i. 18). ΤΙιε expression ‘ fata reclu- 1
dere’ seems tomean ‘to openthedoor of
hell when Fate has closed it!

18. Niyro compulerit—yreqi.] ⁴ Has ga-
thered to the dark crowd.' The dative is
only admissible in poetry. S. ·ii. 5. 49:

“ Si quis casus puerum egerit 0rco,” for
‘ ad Orcum.’

19. Durum.- sed levius] Donatus says·
that Virgil was much in the habit of com-
mending this virtue of patience, saying that
the hardest fortunes might be overcome by
a wise enduranee of them. marefon, say s

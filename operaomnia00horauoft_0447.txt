SATIRE IX.

ζ ἢ This satin, which is justly popular for im humour and great dramatic power, has an

huna-inhalas aa showing, undesignedly but more clearly than almost any deeoeiption
could do, the character of Horace. It puts the man before us as in a picture.
Hs represents himself as sauntering alone and early on the Sacra Via, when a person
he knew no more than by name, a forward coxcomb, comes up familiarly and falls into
conversation with him, to his great aunoyance, for he wanted to be alone and knew the
fellow's cham, which was probably notorious. Horace does his best to shake him off,
but he is too amiable to eope with the effrontery of his companion, whose-object is to
get through Horace an introductiou to Maecenas, with whom the poet must therefore
- havebeenlmown to he on terms of intimacy at the time this Satire was written. The
man's vulgarity and want of tect are conspicuous throughout the scene, as 1 have shown
in the notes3 while Horace exhibita in every part good breeding and an amiable temper;
and though he is tried to the utmost by reflections on his patron and his friends, he is
incapable of saying a rude word, is taken off his guard continually, and is amusingly con.
adona of his inferiority to the man of insolence on his own ground. The effect of this
picture is heightened by the inu-oduction towards the end of the scene of Fuscus Aristius,

’ an om friend of the poet, aud a man or the world, who, like Horace, understood cha-
ποτε, hut had that sort of moral courage and promptitudo which his friend wanted.
‘ne readiness with which he takes up the joke and enters into Horaoe’s absurd position, ·
and the despair to which his dosertion reduces the poet, are highly ludicrous.

If· proof were wanting that the characters of men and the ways of the world are little
Μ by the lapse of oenmries, this Satire would afford it. I look upon it as the most
guin and characteristic of all Horace’s productions. If we wanted to form an estimate
of flio man, 1 do not think we could go to any other part of his works with more likeli- v
hood of getting a correct one; and his powers as a moral satirist are, 1 conceive, feeble

’ ⁷ compared with his perception of, and ability to describe, a scene of dramatic humour like

this. If he had lefl: us only this amusing poem to judge by, his genius would have
rankcd high, and the goodness of bis nature would have been acknowledged by all. Like
our amiable poet Cowper, Horace appears as a satirist of human life and of the vices of
society3 but both are too gentle for that rough work, and shine most in scenos of
quaint humour and inoffensive fun. As roepects Horace at least, let any one read this
Satire and judge for himself.

Seu Graeco jubeas trocho
Seu malis vetita legibus alea,

Cum perjura patris fides
consortem socium fallat et hospitem

Indignoque pecuniam
Heredi properet.

where will be found engravings of three
geme illustrating’ the praefice very clearly.
The hoop waa of metal, audit was guided

boys commonly use now.

58. vetita leyibm alem] There were laws
at Rome, aa therearcwith us, against gam-
ing, which practice was nevertheleas very
prevalent among all classes in the degenerate
times of the reputh and the empire. Ju-
venal complains that young children learnt
it from their fathers (xiv. 4) ε
“ si damnosa senem juvat alea ludit et

Ἢ, parvoque eadem movet arma fri-
Harh’al has many references to this vicious
habit, which had scope allowed it at the
somnialia: ·

“ Dum blanda vagus alea December

Incertis sonat hinc et hinc fritillis
Et ludit popa nequiore talo.’'
(Epp. iv. 14. 7, sqq.)

Cimo charges M. Antonius with pardoning
one Licinius Lenticula, who had been con-
demned for gaming‚ and with whom Anto-
nius, who, if we are to believe Cicero, wasa
great gambler, had been in the habit of
playing. “Hominem omnium nequism'mum
. qui non dubitaret vel in foro alea ludere

lege quae est de alea condemnatum' ιιι inte·
grum restituit ’⁹ (Phil. ii. 23). See Diet.
Ant. art. ‘ alea!
⁷ 60. eomortem socium] ⁴ Consortee '
aometimes stands for ‘zcoheirs ’ “Sora et
patrimonium significat, unde consortes di-
ffioffijffl ωέἑέοῃξὲἓῗηᾙᾞ
inter consortea.'' The word bears this
meaning in Cic. m Verr.‘ 1i. 3. 23· . “Quum
ex agria tres stati-ee consortes ’ nt,”
and in Iaivy‚xli.27: “Censoris frater et

quidem consors.” Bentley understands the
word in this aenae here, following Dacier,
and proposes to insert ‘ct' between ‘con-
sortem' and ‘sociuml There- is no MS.
authority for this reading, and the meaning
of ¹ consors ’ is not confined to co-heirship.
‘Consortem socium’ seems ω mean the
parmer whose capital was embarked with
his own. 'Hie Romana held it to be a very
serious offence for a man to cheat his
ner. Cicero (pro Roac. Am. c. 40) says
“in rebus minoribus fallere socium turpis·
simum estl’ And again,⁴ ‘recte igitur ma-
iores eum qui socium fefellisset· ιιι bonorum
virorum numero non putarunt haberi opor-
tere.” Also, in his speech for Roscius the
player, he says (c. 6),“ aeque enim perfidio-
sum et nefarium est fidem frangere quae
continet vitam, et pupillum fraudare qui in
tutelam pervenit, et eodum fallere qui se in
negotio conjunxit‚'' which last words seem
to explain ⁶ consors! Horace couplae these
two last crimes in Epp. ii. 1. 123:

“Non fraudem socio puerove incogitat nl·
ruffi...»

OEcero (de cl. Orat. c. 1) unitea in another
sense Horace’s two words : ‘⁴ Socius et con-
sors gloriosi laboris.'’ If Bentley had
thought of this passage, he would have in-
serted ‘ et ' ‘¹ vel centum codicibus invitis.’'

‘Hospites ’ is the reading of many good
MSS„ and Bentley adopts it. There is
more imiformity' ιιι the si

62. im probae] This is one of the most
difficult words to which to assign its proper
meaning. Forcellini gives three or four
separate heads with quotations illustrafive
of each, under any one os which most of
the examplae in the others might be clasaed.
Orelli has quoted instancee (on C. iii. 9.
22) in which it is applied to labour, a jack-
daw, a man, a mountain, 8 tiger, winter,
and the Adriatic Sea. He might have
added others: see Index. It implica ‘ex-
cess,' and that excess must be expressed
according to the subject described.

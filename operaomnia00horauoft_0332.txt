302 HORATII FLAGGI

Fomenta vulnus nil malum levantia,
Desinet imparibus certare summotus pudor.
Ubi haec severus te palam laudaveram,
J ussus abire domum ferebar incerto pede ἰο
Ad non amicos heu mihi postes et heu
Limina dura, quibus lumbos et infregi latus.
Nunc gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam
Vincere mollitie amor Lycisci me tenet,

Ἀλέξανδρος Ἀμμωνος υἱὸς εἶναι καὶ
κεράσφορος ἀναπλάττεσθαι πρὸς τῶν
ἀγαλματοποίων (Clem. Alex. Protrept. p.
36). The horns which are so generally
ascribed to Bacchus by the poets are very
rarely met with on his statues‚——possibly, as
Spence suggests, from their being small, and
his head crowned with ivy or vine leaves.
15. Quodsi meis] These lines are not
easy. He means to say that· his wrath has
got the better of his love and modesty3 and
he will cast his complaints to the winds,
and cease to contend with rivals that are
unworthy of him. This supposes the com-
mon reading ¹ inaestuet ' to be wrong, which
I believe it is. Doering and Gesner have
⁴ inaestuat! ΤῙιθ two later Berne MSS. of
Orelli also have ⁴ inaestuat,’ and it appears
to me that that is the proper word. The
other could only be rendered as a hypothe-
tical threat (as Cruquius says) that if he
could only get up his wrath sufficiently to
cast his complaints away, he would abandon
Inachi23 which does not appear very 'good
sense. ⁴ Si ' is not hypothetical, but affirm-
ative, and the whole is a positive resolution
made one moment and broken the nextg
otherwise the inoonsisteucy of the lover’s
conduct is lost. ⁴ Fomenta ¹ means 4 sighs '
and ‘complainings’ with which grief is
sought to be relieved. Lambinus, Turnebus,
and others take ‘fomenta' for ⁴alimenta,¹
⁴ thoughts which foster love and sorrow, ·'
but that is disproved by the words that
follow ε 4 vulnus nil malum levantia! Such
ineffectual remedies are elsewhere called
‘⁴ frigida curarum fomenta '' (Epp. i. 3. 26).
⁴ Fomenta ’ are there glory and such like re-
wards. ⁴ Libera bilis,' ⁴ unrestrained wrath,’
as above (Ep. 4. 10), “liberrima indig-
natio.¹’ ⁴ Imparibus' signifies his rivals
who are beneath him in mind though his
betters in fortune. With the exception of
‘imparibus’ and‘ fomenta,’ Turnebus (Adv.
xxv. 20) gives the usual acceptation of
the passage: “Fomenta—si virili quadam
ira in praecordiis aestuante dimiserit, prae-
sertim ingrata nec vulnus amoris levantia—-
‘me, 'inquit, ‘paulo invmcundius geram,

nee ita pudenter summittam amicae, sed
eam aspernabor desinamque sectari imparem
neque redamantem-¹ '' ‘Desinet catam
summotus pudor ’ is equivalent to ⁴ desinam
certare summoto pudore! ⁴ Imparibus ' is
the dative case. See C. i. 1. 15, ιι. 4 Ιιι-
aestuo ’ is not used elsewhere, but Horace
isfreeinhisuseofp sifionsinoom-
position, after the manner of the Greeb.
⁴ Palam' is used both as au adverb and a
preposition (see ForcelL). ‘manvu-an·
is equivalent to ‘jacmvm,' which use
Forcell. does not notice.

20. incerto pede] With steps thav would
go one way and are forced to go anethfl'
Some have interpreted‘ incerto' ‘reela‘
from the effecte oswine, doetroying the
effect of the whole passage, ιιι which the
poet obviously represents himself as making
fine boasts before his friend, but striving iu
vain to keep them when he leaves him. So
Tibull. (ii. 6. ll):

‘⁴ Magna loquor ς sed magnifice mthmagnn
Exiffiiluhgt clausae fortia verba fores.

J uravi quot'ies rediturum ad limina nnn-

Qgffie juravi pes tamen ipse redit-'⁹

24. mollitie amor] The hiatus ιιι· thi- ’

verse, and the short syllable in v. 26, are
explained by the rule that, the two vem-ses
being compo sed of two separate mensures,
the last syllable ιιι each is common, aad
independent of the syllable that follows.

others, by the judgment of the multitude. Thia diseo-use is added on rather abruptly
to a thot-t description of Hmoe’s residenoe, to follow which any body who eun get it
should mad the Abbe Capmartin de Chaupy'a ‘ Deeouverte de la Maisan de Campagne
d'Eoraee,’ printed at Rome in 1767. lt is written with great vivacity and intelligenoe,
though, as in ench msae must always be expected, with a tendency to strain his proofs
and to attempt mone preciaion than the drcnmstanoes admit of.

ARGUMENT.

To nveyon the trouble of osking about my estate, my good Quintium—my eope und
my olives, my orcha-ds, meadows, and κώπη-Ι will describe it to yon at fnll length.
nee is a chain of mountnins broken by n shady valley, of which one side gem the
rayn of the morning sun, the other of the evening. The climate yon would li'ke; and
when 1 tell you 1 have eoruels and plums growing wild, and oaks to give nom-ns to my
“boandsshadetotheirmastenyonwillthinkTarentum hasdrawn nearertoBome.
'fluenlhave a stream that mightbe ealled a river,forHebrusis not mom dem-or
oool, good for the head and good for the stomach. 'ro thaee retreets, which 1 love,
and which are in truth delightful, yon owe it that your friend is alive in September.

Youtoo nte oounted a happy man: see that you be so; trust not to the judgment of
othere but to your own of yourself, and remember that none but the sage is happy.
'rho people may think you sound, bnt if you are oenscious of a sever in your veina do
not attempt to hide it. If any one mlks of your wax-s in language that fits only
Augustus, yon shrink from the lie3 but when they eall yon good and wise, do yon not
aeoept the eompliment? Well, say you, 1 like to be praised, as Ι suppose you
do yonrself. But do you not know that they who give cau take away their pruine?
Give it back, any they, and yon must do so. What if theyeall me thies, parricide, doec
that affect me? Who bnt the vicione eure for false praise or salse blame? Who ia
therenllygood man? Thevulgar will point to the oorrectmanwho keeps thelaws
and is in favour in the eom-ts, but his intimantes may know him better. Thtzre are
some who do not sin for sear of punishment3 but the good mm is good because he
lovae goodnoee. Your good man who is so looked up towhen he saaifioes hashis
ailant prayer to Janns, Apollo, Inverna, that they will promote and hide his knnvoey.
1 cannot see when-ein he is better than the poor slave who stops bo pick np an m from
the pavement. He who (ιι-πω will feam and he who fears is not a free man in my
judgment. He has deeerted the ranks of virtue who is ever busied in making money.
Sellhim for a slave: he is fit for that3 whereasthe sage mn snyto his tyn-ant “tnkeall
1 have, put me in bonds if you will; bnt when 1 pleuse, heaven will set me fiee‚·” for
he thinks thus: ⁸⁸ 1 ean die; and death is the goal of all things-'¹

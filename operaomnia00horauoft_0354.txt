324 HORATII FLAOGI

ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, why is it that no man is oontent with his own lot, but every one envies his
neighbour? The weary soldier envies the trader3 the trader on the stormy deep
envies the soldier; the jurisconsult, impatient of his early client, envies the oountry-
man, who dragged up to town by a law suit, envies the inhabitants of the town. Thera
is no eud to the instanoes. Well, suppose some god were to offer them their wish,
and bid them change places,—they would refuso it ! What hinders the wrath of heaven
from visiting these murmurers, and the ears of Jove being closed against them for
ever? But to be serious (though truth may be told in jest), the toiling ploughman,
the cheating host, the soldier, the ventui-ons trader, pretend their only object is to
secure a provision for old age, like the ant provident of the sumre. But she retiree
when the winter comes, and enjoys her stone3 while winter and summer, fire, sword,
and waves obstruet not your pursuit of wealth. What is the use of treasure which
you hide like a coward in the ground? ‘⁴ Oh, but if you take from it you will soon
reduce it to nothing.” Be it so3 but if you do not, what charms has the pile of eoin?
If you thresh thousands of bushels of corn, you cannot eat more than me. The slave
that carries the bread eats no more than he who carries none. Live within the boanda
of nature, and a hundred acres are as good as a thousand. ‘⁴ But it is so pleasant to
take what you want from a huge heap !” Nay, Ι do not see why my baskets are not
as good as your barus, if 1 can take as much from my store as you from yours. You
might as well prefer to draw a cup of water from the swollen Aufidus rather than the
little stream by your side3 but so you may find that your lise is the penalty of your
greediness, while another gets his water clear and keeps his life from drowning. But
most men think they never can haveenough. The more you have, say they, the more
you will be thought of. Now what is ιο be done with a man of this sort? ’ You ean
only leave him in the misery he prefers; as the miser at Athens, when the people
hissed him, said, ‘⁶ Never mind 3 1 look at my money-box when Ι get home, and applaud
myself.” Tantalus eatehes at the retreating waters—why smile? Change the name,
and the story belongs to you. Even thus you gloat over your money as you would
gaze at a lovely picture, but you dare not use it. What is the use of money? To
buy the necessaries of life. To lie awake and tremble for thieves, is this your hap-
piness? Save me from such happiness! “But if you are rich you have anxious
friends to nurse you in sickness.'’ Nay, you have not one. Your wife and children,
your neighbours, and all the town detest you. How should it be otherwise? You

prefer your money to them. Suppose you were to bestow a little paine in keeping ·

the affections of your kindred=a blessing nature has given you at no eost of yours—
would it be all lost labour? In short, cease your getting: having more thau enough,
enjoy what you have got, and remember the fate of Ummidius the miser. ‘¹ Well,
but what does all this mean? am I to be a spendthrift like some we know ?’' Nay,
this is only to bring opposite extremes into compar-ison: all things have their limits,
on either side of which right cannot stand. So 1 go back to what 1 began with—that
greedy men are always dissatisfied, aud envying others; and instead of comparing
themselves with those who are poorer, are always hastening to overtake some one
abead of them, like the driver in the chariot race3 so that few retire from life as satis-
fied guests from a banquet, acknowledging with thankfuluess the blessings they have
enjoyed. But enough, or you will say Ι have ransacked Crispinus’ desk.

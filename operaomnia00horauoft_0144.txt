HORATII FLAOOI

ARGUMENT.

Whoever planted thee, thou tree, did so 011 an evil day3 and with impious hand he reared
thee to the destruction of his children and the disgrace of the village. Parricide, guest-
murder,-there is no crime he would not commit. No 011915 safe against danger. Τ119
Phoenician sailor fears the Bosporus, and nothing else3 our soldier the Parthiam the
Parthian nothing but the might of Romeg but death comes suddenly 011 311. How
nearly was I sent ιο ι119 regions below, where all the shades wonder, Cerberus listens,
the Furies are charmed, and the damned suspend their labours, while Sappho complains
of her faithless countrywomen, and Alcaeus sings of the dangers of the deep and of the

battle- field.

ILLE et nefasto te posuit die,
Quicunque primum, et sacrilega manu
Produxit, arbos, 111 nepotum
Perniciem opprobriumque pagi ;
Illum et parentis crediderim sui 5
Fregisse cervicem et penetralia
Sparsisse nocturno cruore
Hospitis ς 1119 venena Colchica
Et quidquid usquam cbncipitur nefas

Tractavit‚ agro qui statuit meo

lo

Te, triste lignum, te caducum
In domini caput immerentis.
Quid quisque vitet nunquam homini satis

1. nefasto] A‘ dies nefastus' was pro-
perly one 011 which, the day being dedicated
to religion, it was not lawful for the praetor
ιο hold his court. Ovid thus defines⁴ dies
fasti’ and ⁴ nefasti ' (Fast. i. 47) :—-

⁴¹ Ille nefastus erit per quem tria verba
Fazffiepffig per quem lege licebit agi ;’'

where the three words alluded to are said
to be ‘ do,’ ‘dico,' ‘addico,' all of them fa-
miliar and of common occurrence in Roman
civil procedure. Hence the name, which is
compounded of ‘ ne' and ⁴ fari.' And, because
no secular work but what was necessary could
prosper on the days called ⁴ nefasti,' all un-
lucky days came to bear that name as here;
and the word was thence applied ιο express
all that was bad, as C. i. 35. 35. Bentley
and others have attempted to mend the text
in a variety of ways, of which Bentley’s is
the worst: ‘Ille a nefasto! “He not only
planted thee on an evil day (whoever it was
that first planted thee), but with impious
hand reared thee. ’' I see no difficulty here.
The pagus was Mandela in a valley of the
Sabine hills, where Horace had his farm.

6. Freqisse cervicem] This is the ordi-

tion. It occurs
E-pod 111. 2. Sallust (Cat. 55) has

“Frangere gulam laqueof' and Cicero (iu

Verrem, ii. v. 42):‘ ‘Praetoremtuaccusas?
Frange cervices! ’The force οἱ*
15, thatin the inner part of the house flio
images of the penates and the hesrth of
Vesta were placed, where, if any where, the
person of a guest should be sacred.

8. venena Colchica] Some MSS. and most
of the old editions have Colchics; and for
the metre's sake Ῑ adopt it. Orelli and
nearly all modern editions have colcha,
which is an ordinary poetical form. Of the
same abbreviated form are Marsus, Maurus,
Medus, Hispanus, &c. .

10. Praetoria] This word is sufficient
for both substantives. There is 110 119095-
sity for supplying ⁴ patravit' for ⁴ nefas,' as
Orelli says. The word ‘tractare' is widely
applied (see Index).

ll. caducum] This word 518111*695 6111-
ing' (iii. 4. 44), ‘ffallen or ‘ready toran!
More generally ι119 last, as here. Virgil
has (Aen. vi. 481). “Hic multum fleti ad
superos belloque caduci Dardanidae? where
it means ⁴ fallen.’

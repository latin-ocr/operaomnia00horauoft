GARMEN XXII.

Horace on some occasion thought fit to dedicate a pine in his gai-den to Diana, and his
commentatore. have suggested various reasons and occasions for his doing so. One thinks
it may have been when he first had possession of his farm, which enables him to fix the
date of the ode3 another that he had had an escape from the attack of s boat pig; the
French editors have settled it was on the arrival of news that one of his mista-esses had
been safely delivered of a child ; “ for the ode,” says Dacier, ‘⁸ has all the air os a thanks-
giviug,” which suspicion Jani does not deny to his judgment ⁴ valde arridet: while all
other conjecturers, in his opinion, ‘ multa nugantur! Whether his ‘ nugae ¹ sui-pass the
⁴ nugae ’ of others or not, the reader will judge for himself. But it may surely be pro-
nounced to be the idlest sort of trifling which thus attempts to fix causes from such im-
penetrable data, and turns the edge of a pretty trifle like this by forcing it into matur of
fact. How long the child born on this memorable occasion survived its birth, or how
many such the numerous mistresses of the poet (une de ses maitresses 1) bore him, we

are not informed by the sagacity of Sanadon and Dacier. The dedication of trees to
particular divinities was not uncommon. Fea quotes an inscription in which T. Pom-

ponius Victor vows a thousand large trees to Silvanus: ‘ru mr moseum mnas ’

Diana, who protectest the mountains and woods‚ and deliverest women in childbirth, to
thee I dedicate this pine, and will offer thee the sacrifice of a boar.

92 HORATII FLAOGI

and youth permit, and life is our own ? soon thou must give up all to thine hein rich
and noble, or poor and humble, we must all come to one place in the end.

AEQUAM memento rebus in arduis
Servare mentem, non secus in bonis
Ab insolenti temperatam
Laetitia, moriture Delli,
Seu maestus omni tempore vixeris, 5
Seu te in remoto gramine per dies
Festos reclinatum bearis
Interiore nota Falerni.
Quo pinus ingens albaque populus
Umbram hospitalem consociare amant
ι Ramisi Quid obliquo laborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo?
Huc vina et unguenta et nimium breves
Flores amoenae ferre jube rosae,
Dum res et aetas et sororum
Fila trium patiuntur atra.
Gedes coemptis saltibus et domo
Villaque flavus quam Tiberis lavit,
Gedes et exstructis in altum
Divitiis potietur heres,

2. non secus in] A very few MSS. have
⁴ non secus ac,' which Bentley prefers as
the more usual phrase: but ⁴ non secus'
may stand alone.

gatory mark, ⁴ quid' is 1 think the true
reading. Itis that of the oldest Berne and
Blandignian MS. Ste phens (1600) has‘ et,'

aud Bentley and most of the later editors,

8. Interiore nota Falerni] The cork of
the ‘ amphora ’ was stamped with the name
of the consul in whose year it was filled,
and the ‘amphorae’ being placed in the
‘apotheca' as they were filled, the oldest
would be the innermo'st. Cicero (Brut.
83), mentioning the speeches in Thucy-
dides, likens them to very old Falernian,
and says the style had better be avoided,
‘⁴ tanquam Anicianam notam,'’ like wine of
the consulship of Anicius, ‘⁴ atque eae notae
sunt optimae, credo, sed nimia vetustas nec
habet eam quam quaerimus suavitatem nec
est jam sane tolerabilis.”

9. Quo pinus inqens] The oldest and
best MSS. have ‘ quo‚' which signifies ‘ to
what purpose,' as “ quo mihi fortunam si non
conceditur uti. >'’ (Epp. i. 5. 12). ‘Qua' is
Bentley' s reading from two MSS. of Lam-
binus, who was the first to adopt it. In
v. ll the MSS. vary between‘ qu0,’ ’(11111,ν
and‘ quid! Landinus has the first3 As-
eensius and Lambinus the second3 Cru-
quius has ‘quid?' Without the 1111οπ0-

but no MSS. Τ110 Scholiast Porphyrion
had‘ quo obliquo,' and his comment is
“ subaudiendum, si ea non utimur3 et est
totum adverbialiter dictum,'' which shows
the sense iu which he understood the pus-
sage. But such 88 hiatus is quite inad-
missible. ι’0,118 88(1 ‘'et arevery simple
emendations, and give a good meaning.
But Ι cannot account for the other readings

ifHoracewrote ‘qua—et! Heseemsto -'

mean, ‘⁴ What were the shade and the ooo]
stream given for? Bring out the wine 81111
let us drink;'' which is abrupt, and more
spirited than the other.

albaque populus] Not ⁴ altaque ⁹ as
the oldest editions have it, corrected by
Lambinus. This mistake arose from Epod.
ii. 10, ‘⁴ Altas maritat populos.'’ The Greeks
had two names for the poplar—htvm), which
was white, and αἴγειρος, which was dark-
Virgil calls the white ⁴ bicolor.¹ ‘ Amant,'
as in C. iii. 16. 10, is used like the Greek

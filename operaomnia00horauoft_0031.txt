CARMINUM

LIBER PRIMUS.

CARMEN I.
A.U.C. 730.

Wnrmnn. this ode is an introduction to one book or three is a question that has
been discussed and must be matter of opinion. 1 think it probable that the three
first books were published together, with this as a prefaoe3 md ir the chronological
arrangement Ι have adopted (see Introduction) be correct it was written A.u.c. 730;
but them is no inter-nal evidence to lead to that conclusion. Bentley was of opinion
that euch book was produced separately. It is a gnoeful dedication to Maecenas of a
work, the composition of which had occupied and amused the poet at intervals for some

years. 1t was probably at his patron's instigation that he arranged his fugitive pieces >

ind put them forth in this collected form. There is a mixture of real affection with
the usual dedicatory flattery in this ode, the leading idea of which, as in most cases,
Hor-00 probably bon-owed from the Greek. There is a fragment of Pindar (201 Bergk),
preserved in Sextus Empiricus, which with others Horace may have had in mind, and
it will account for the somewhat incongruons allusion to the Olympio gemes in the
beginning of this ode. It 1s the only wey of explaining the allusion to an almost obso-
leto praefice, tobenr in mind that thiswas the chief themeof Pindar’s poetry.'1'he

ἀελλοπόδων μέν τιν’ εὐφραίνουσιν· ἱππων

τίμια καὶ στέφανοι· τοὺς δ’ ἐν πολυχρύσοις θαλάμοις βιοτά·
τέρπεται δὲ καί trac ἐπ’ οἶδμ’ ἅλιον ναῒ θοᾷ

σῦς διαστείβων .....

A fingment of Archilochus (33 Bergk), from Clemens Alexandrinus, runs·
ἄλλ’ ἄλλος ἄλλῳ καρδίην’ univerae.

3:¹⁷ But the sentiment is common enough, and with the exception of the first illustration
, ’ 'Horace hss put the subject in his own way und given it a Latin dress. It will be

j obmed, that while the leading sentiment is the common-place “ different men have dif-

trust (not without some contempt) with his own higher ambition. He had, no doubt, in

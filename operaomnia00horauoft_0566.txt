536 HORATII FLACGI

SATIRE VIII.

This Satire represents a dinner given by a rich vulgar man to Maecenas and five of his
friends. There is not so much to distinguish it in the way of humour as the subject
admitted of. Few subjects present more scope for facetious satire than the airs of low-
born men, lately become rich, aping the ways of the fashionable world, and making wealth
their one passport into what is called good society. This is a very slight sketch, and
some of the force even of this is perhaps lost through our ignorance of little points of
etiquette and culinary refinements observed by the Romans of that day.

The host's name is Nasidienus Rufus. Who he was it is impossible to say. Lambinus
supposes Q. Salvidienus Rufus to be meant, a man of obscure origin whom Augustus
advanced to equestrian rank for services rendered against Sex. Pompeius, and who was
afterwards consul designatus. He put an end to himself in A.u.c. 714, which was long
before this Satire was written, and the theory would not be worth mentioning if Heindorf
and Buttmann had not supported it. Spohn (Jahn’s Horace, Ed. ii. p. 271) supposes
Q. Nasidius, one of the commanders under M. Antonius, and mentioned by Dio Cassius
(i. 13) to be the host. But as we cannot arrive at any real knowledge on the subject,
and as the essence of the' Satire oonsists in the obscurity of the person, it is useless to
speculate about him.

Instead of telling the story himself, though it is‘probable from the tone of the Satira ’

that he writes from a scene he had witnessed, Horace puts it into the mouth of his friend
Fundanius, the comic writer mentioned in S. i. 10. 42, where see note. ¹

It is impossible to conjecture with any probability the date of the Satire, though it may
be assumed that it was written after Horace’s intimacy with Maecenas had begun.

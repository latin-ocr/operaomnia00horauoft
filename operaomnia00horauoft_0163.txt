CARMEN XX.

This ode has none of the appearance to my mind of having been written, like the last
of the third book, for the purpose of closing and commending a completed work, as those
affirm who believe the two first books were published separately. There does not appear
to be any method in the arrangement of the odos between the introductory one of the
first book and the last of the third (with the exception of the six first of that book which
are evidently connected with one another) ς and the position of this is probably as nocidennl
as that of others. This ode appears to have been written impromptu, and I think the style
is noch-heroic, or but half serious, though Horace had at least as much right as others to
commend his poetry and to be consciens of his own powers. Various specimens of aelf-
'commendation, on the part of the poets, are quoted by Dillenb. on C. iii. 30, beginning
with Ennius’ famous verses, —

“Nemo me lacrumis decoret nec funera fletu
Faxit. Cur. ³ Volito vivu' per ora virum!

1 think ‘ quem vocas’ refers to some particular invitation of Maecenas, and that the ode
was the result of that invitation, which opinion 1 had expressed before I met with Dil-
lenbr.’s commenta on this ode in his Qu. Hor. (1841, Bonn). He there treats it as an
outburst of youthful spirits on⁴the occasion of Maecenas’ first invitation, described in Sat.
i. 6. The epithet ‘dilecte, ¹ implyingafamiliarity of some standing, is opposed to this
view, and Dillenbr. says nothing about it in his edition of Horace, though he there treats
theode as ajuvenileproducfion.1donotseeanyreasonto agreewith him astothat

particular point.

ARGUMENT.

On afieah strong wing shall Ι soar to heaven far above envy and the world. Whom
thou, dear Maecenas, delightest to honour, Styx hath no power ιο detain. Even now
my plumage is springing, and I am ready to fly away and sing in distant plaoes, and to
teach bubaroua natione. No wailings for me : away with the empty honours of a tomb.

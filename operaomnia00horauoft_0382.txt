HORATII FLAGGI

Si cui filius est, ut abortivus fuit olim
Sisyphus; hunc varum distortis cruribus ; illum
Balbutit scaurum pravis fultum male talis.

Parcius hic vivit, frugi dicatur.
Et jactantior hic paulo est, concinnus amicis
At est truculentior atque

Postulat ut videatur.

Haec res et jungit junctos et servat amicos.

At nos virtutes ipsas invertimus, atque
Sincerum cupimus vas incrustare.

See also Sueton.Vit. Tib. c. 61 (? 62). That
‘varus' is a sofl: term for those who have
bent legs, and ‘scaurus ’ for one whose
aucles are ricketty, we may gather from this
passage, not from the dictionaries. No one
would like to have a child either ‘varus'
or ‘scaurus’ according to Forcellini's de-
finitions. Celsus defines ‘varus' as one
whose foot turns in; and Heindorf says it
represents the shape of the letter V. From
this word is derived ‘praevaricat’ ‘ to
shuffie. ’ Rutg ersius has a long argument
(Lect. Ven. p. g312) to show that for‘ illum'
(v. 47) should be written‘ Hillumss to re-
present one Hirrus, supp posed to bey derided
by Cicero when he says (Ad Fam. ii. 10):

“de te quia quod sperabam: de Hillo
(balbus enim sum) quod non putaram.'’
Bentley has sufficiently refuted this wild
notion, and has also humorously enough

the lisping of the fond parent, like Alci-
biades, in Aristophanes play (Vesp. 45)—

where Alcibiades’ peculiarity is made the
means of creating a laugh against Theorus
by changing κόρακος into κόλακος. But no
joke at all ean be made out of‘ sonulam!
Lucretius describes the blindness of lovers

what the French know well by the name of
‘taen’ Cicero thus defines the word (de Or.

says this passage is a rock of bad name for
the shipwreck all interpretem have made
upon it. “Scopulus interpretum omnium
naufragiis infamis.'’ 1 am afraid he must
be admitted to have ,81181011 the common
fate. His reading 18-

‘Ille' for ‘illi’ has the authority of the
oldest Blandinian MS„ according to crn-
quius ‘’Ac is Bentley’ 8 own conjecture.
I do not think‘ ille' is latin in the con-
struction he assumes: ‘suppose we have

but the above 18 said to have (1111,’ which
must agree with‘ tardo,’ and that must be
taken in a good sense as slow and steady.
That ⁸ demissus’ may be used in a good
sense, and is 80 used by Cicero in connexion
with ‘ probuS,' is quite true (Orat. ii. 43):

“eaque omnia quae proborum, demissorum,

78 HORATII FLAOGI

Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas
Glavos trabales et cuneos manu
Gestans aena, nec severus
Uncus abest liquidumque plumbum.
Te Spes et albo rara Fides colit
Velata panno nec comitem abnegat,
Utcunque mutata potentes
Veste domos inimica linquis.
At volgus infidum et meretrix retro
Perjura cedit, diffugiunt cadis
Cum faece siccatis amici
Ferre jugum pariter dolosi.
Serves iturum Gaesarem in ultimos
Orbis Britannos et juvenum recens
Examen Eois timendum
Partibus Oceanoque rubro.

14. Stantem columnam,] The figures
of Peaee, Security, Happiness, and others,
are 83811 represented on old monuments 38
resting on a column. Addison (Dial. ii. on
Medals) mentions a medai of Antoninus
Pius on the reverse of which succurras
Pu amc». is thus represented.

17. Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas]
The several things that Necessity is here
represented as holding are emblems of
tenacity and fixedness of purpose—the mil,
the clamp, and the molten lead : vthey have
nothing to do with torture as many have
supposed.

18. ‘Clavi trabales ' had passed into a
proverb with the Romans. Compare Cicero
in Verr. Act. ii. 5. 21: “ut 1108 beneficium,
quemadmodum dieitur, trabali clavo fige-
ret.'' ‘Cunei' were also nails wedge-
shaped, the diminutive of which* cuneoli’
Cicero employs in translating a passage
from Plato's Timaeus (p. 1055), οὐ τοῖς
ἀλύτοις οἷς αὐτοὶ συνείχοντο δεσμοῖς dud
ὂιᾰ σμικρότητα ἀοράτως πυκνοῖς γόμφοις
συντ-ἠκοντες, which Cicero renders‘ crebris
quasi cuneolis injectis‘ (Tim. 13). For-
cellini does not give this sense of ¹ cuneus,’
but it occurs in Cicero's translation from
Aeschylus (Tusc. ii. 10), where Prometheus
fastened to the rock says of Mulciber,

“Hos ille 81111808 fabrica crudeli' inserens
Perrupit artus. qua miser sollertia
Trprpggssrberatus castrum 1108 furiarum

Pindar uses the same metaphor (Pyth.
iv. 71), τίς δὲ κίνδυνος κρατεροῖς ‹idci-

μῖἕτος δῆσειὲὶᾶλέοιςλς md Aeschylus (Sup-
{a affl) μενειΐῇρῖξῖζωζῗὲῗῖ.ἴ1ὥζέῗ
OnthenailsofFateseeC. iii.24. 7. The
metaphorofmoloeu lead, used for οτι-8118111811-
ing buildings, is used by Euripides (Androm.
267), καὶ γὰρ εἰ πέριξ σ’ ἔχει rna-rec μό-
RvglbcThe picture represented m this and ’

the following stanzas, apert from the 3118- ’ s

gory, is that of a rich man in adversity
going forth from his home with hope iu his
breast and accompanied by a few faithful
friends, but desei-ted by those who only
cared for his wealth. Iu the person of
Fortune therefore is represented the man
who is suffering from her reversas, aud in
that of Fidelity the small (rara) company
of his true friends. For-tune is represented
in the garments of mourning (mutata
veste), and Fides in 3 white veil emblemafie
of her purity. With such a veil on their

head men offered sacrifico to her, according ‘

to the Scholiasts on thisp
called by Virgil (Aen. i. 206) Cana Fides‚'

passage. 811818

where Servius has a note which connects ‘

the expression with this of Horace. But

there it probably means ‘'aged. According
to Livy (i. 21) Ν111113 established religIous

rites for Fides.
22. nec comitem abne-wa] Ovid (A.
A. i. 127) 1138 copied this expression, which

is the same asif‘ se ’had been added. ‘⁶ si ,

qua repugnarat nimium comitemque ne-
garat.” Bentley, quite mistaking the eha-
racter ‘of this passage, proposes to read
¹ vertis ’ for ‘ linquis,’ v. 24.

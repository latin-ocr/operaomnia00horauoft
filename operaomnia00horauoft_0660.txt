The two last verses are almost literally
translated in vv. 77, 78. Pentheus, king
of Thebes, hearing that a young stranger
has come to his country, giving himself out
to be Dionys us, and has tempted all the
women to go out and do honour to him,
sends his servants to apprehend him. The
god allows himself to be taken, and, when

The application is obvious. The good man ,

can bid defiance to the revel-ses of Fortune,

EPISTLE XVII.

Who Scaeva was there are no means of determining. He is said by the Scholiasta to
have been an ⁴ eques,' and they call him Lollius Scaeva fmm a confusion of this with the
next Epistle. Scaeva was a cognomen of the Junii and Cassii, as Torrentius observes.
There was one of this name a distinguished officer in Caesar's army (de Bell. Civ. iii. 53).
But it is quite immaterial who this Scaeva was. He bears no part in the Epistle‚ which
might have been addressed to any body of his age. Its professed purpose is to instruct a
young man how to rise in the world by paying court to great people, which is declam-ed to
be an art of no small merit. The chief secret of this art is said to be a well-affected
modesty, and a tact in letting your wants be rather felt than heard by your patron, and
this is the only advice that is offered. The Epistle ends abruptly, and is a mere
fragment.

Horace' s argument for what we call tuft- hunting, which was the universal pra'ctice of
his day and grew with the growth of tyranny and the decline of the general liberty
and the morals of the olden time, is that it was necessary, if a man would do good to
himself and his family; that he who affected to despise it, like Diogenes the Cynic, was
no more independent than he who practised it, but less so 3 while the other, like Aristip-
pus, while he sought great people, and exerted himself manfully to gain them, might at
the same time be indifferent to the fruits of success, being able to accommodate himself
to any condition whatever ε a poor apology for a degrading system. Horace had himself
been a successful courtier. and now, after many years’ intimacy with Maecenas, could talk
of his independence, as in the seventh Epistle, and of emulating the indifference of Aris-
tippus3 but he must have seen as much as any man of the disappointments, pains, in-

HORATII FLAGGI

Sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles
Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus
Posset, quid Augusti paternus
In pueros animus Nerones.
Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis;
Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum
Virtus, neque imbellem feroces

Progenerant aquilae columbam ;

Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborant ;
Utcunque defecere mores
Indecorant bene nata culpae.
Quid debeas, o Roma, Neronibus

Testis Metaurum flumen et Hasdrubal

Devictus et pulcher fugatis
Ille dies Latio tenebris
Qui primus alma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.

ness of some editors, who do not understand
their legitimate province, to throw upon the
dishonesty of copyists the defects they pro-
fess to find in their author (see C. iii. 11.
17. ιιι. 17, Introduction). ¹ Sed ’ is commonly
used aster digressions to reoover the thread
of the subject.

24. revictae] The various reading of a
few corrected MSS. ‘ repressae,’ which the
Scholiast Porphyrion seems to have followed,
and which Bentley has admitted into the
text, is not nearly so well supported by au-
thority as ⁴ revictae,’ and has not its weight.
Foroell. refers to Lucret. (v. 410), “ Inde
cadunt vires aliqua ratione revictae,” and
Orelli to Cic. pro Sulla (1), “perditi cives
redomiti atque victi.” ‘ Reductae' (1 sup·
pose for ‘ redactae’), ‘ repulsae ' and other
variatione are to be met with, but ‘ revictae ’
is the true reading, and nobody will think
it necessary to follow Bentley in changing
⁴ faustis’ into ‘ sanctis’ without any better
authority than his taste in epitheta. That
⁴ re ’ is added to some verbs without mate-
rially changing their meaning has been shown
before, C. i. 31. 12, n. The difference be-
tween ‘ mens’ and ⁴ indoles' is, that one
refers to the head, the other to what we
should call the beart, the disposition.

29. Fortes creantur] It is more than

probable that Horace had ‘m hia mind Euri,-
pides' words,—

ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλὰ γίγνεσθαι τέκνα,
κακῶν δ’ ὅμοια τῇ φύσει τῇ τοῦ πατρός.
(Fr. Almn. 7.)
‘ Fortibus et bonis ’ co nde to the com-
mon Greek expression which it is eo diffi-
cult to render, καλοῖς κάγαθοῖς. Tho-o
words are in the ablative case. Orelli has
quoted several instaneee of their use by
Cicero. Among others, see Cic. inVere. ii. 3.
69, “Quem ego, judices, quamvis bonum for,-
temque facile paterer evadere,” δια, where
he says he should be glad to see Venes’ son
turn out a better man than his iether,

which he thinks is possible, thou& (on ’

Horace’s principle) not probable. Thoee
whom Horace is ref “ to are the wor-
thies of the Claudian family, not, as Orelli
rightly observes, to the unworthy father of
the two youths whom Augustus had adopted,
and one of whom (Drusus) was believed,
not without reason, to be his own eon.
⁴ Indecoraut’ and ¹ dedecorant' (v. 36) are
both supported by good MSS. The least
likely form to have been invented is ⁸ inde-
corant‚' aud (as it is consistent with m-
logy) I have on that account adopted it.
Bentley prefers, but does not adopt it. -

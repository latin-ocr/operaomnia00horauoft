HOR‘ATII FLACGI

ARGUMENT.

1 have a good old amphora of Alban with parsley and ivy to make thee a crown, Phyllis}
silver on my board, and an altar that waits for the sacrifice3 the slaves are busy, the
fire is burning, come and celebrate the Ides of April, for it is Maeoenas’ birthday,
more sacred to me than my own. Telephus is matched already, and is no match
for thee. The fates of Phaethon and Bellerophon teach thee to beware of ambition.

Come, my last love, with thy sweet voice sing the song I shall teach thee ; song shall

drive care away.

Esr mihi nonum superantis annum
Plenus Albani cadus; est in horto,

Phylli, nectendis apium coronis ;

Esl·l hederae vis
Multa, qua crines religata fulges; 5
Ridet argento domus; ara castis

Vincta verbenis avet immolato

Spargier agno ;

Cuncta festinat manus, huc et illuc

Cursitant mixtae pueris puellae3

10·

Sordidum flammae trepidant rotantes

Vertice fumum.

2. Albani cadum] The wine of the
Alban hills was of the better kind3 and at
Nasidienus’ supper it was offered to the
chief guest with Falernian (Sat. ii. 8. 16).
Pliny (N. H. xiv. 6) places it third among
the wines of Italy. Juvenal (v. 33) speaks
of Albanian wine, and classes it with Setian,
both of great age :—-

“Cras bibet Albanis aliquid de montibus,
Sessiiitigecujus patriam titulumque senectus
Delevit multa veteris fuligine testae.”

The rich glutton drank it, he says, as a
corrective of yesterday’s debauch.

5. qua crines reliquia fulgen] ⁴ With
which, when you bind your hair, you look
beautiful! The commentators look for the
future tense, but Baxter, uncorrected by
Gesner, says it is ‘⁴ enallage temporis3 ful-
ges pro fulgebis,” and some derive ‘ fulges'
from the form ‘fulgo.' It is obviously the
present tense, and Horace merely says that
a wreath of ivy becomes Phyllis, whenever
she binds her brows with it.

8. Sparqier aquo .·] See Introduction,
sub fin. Rutgersius (Ven. Lect. c. ii.) has
discussed the question whether it was usual
to offer sacrifice on birthdays. Varro, in a
passage quoted by Censorinus, says that

the ancient Romans (maj ores nostri) observed
the custom of abstaining from blood when
they brought offerings to their genius on
their birthday. But it is clear from this
passage of Horace that, whatever was tha
mstom in earlier times, victims were in his
day offered on birthdays as well as any
other days. Juvenal (xi. 84) :—

“ Et natalitium cognatis ponere lardum
Aegl-(1¹:213 nova si quam dabat hostia
2

and Plutarch (Life of Romulus, 212) speak-
ing of the Palilia, which was the feast of
the birthday of Rome, says, ἐν ἀρχῇ δὲ, ὥς
φασιν, οὐδὲν ἔμψυχον ἔθυον ἀλλὰ καθαρὰν
καὶ ἀναίμακτον ᾤοντο δεῖν τῇ πατρίδι τήν ,
2⁷33ss 5225? {1335 2553? ῗξὲρῖἷέ ῗᾶῑῗῑῗῗιῖἐ
practice was no longer observed in the time
of Plutarch. There is no further authority
wanted than this passage of Horace to es·
tablish the fact as regards private birthday
festivals: nor will Orelli's remark be ad-
mitted, that, though the passage from Varro
would establish the opposite fact if Horace
were keeping his own birthday, it does not
follow that he might not shed blood in
celebrating that of Maecenas. As vo ⁸ ver·
benis,’ see C. i. 19. 14, n.

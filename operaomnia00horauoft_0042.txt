HORATII FLAGOI

Sive mutata juvenem figura
Ales in terris imitaris, almae
Filius Maiae, patiens vocari

Caesaris ultor ε

Serus in caelum redeas diuque 45
Laetus intersis populo Quirini ;
Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

Ocior aura

Tollat: hic magnos potius triumphos,
Hic ames dici pater atque princeps, 50
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos

though 118 1188 forty years old at this time.
So Virg. (G. i. 500) :—
“ Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere

saeclo
Ne prohibete.''

‘ J uvenis ' and ‘ adolescens ’ were used for

the time he put down Catiline’s conspiracy,
*when he was forty-four years old. and as
⁴ senex ’ when he delivered his 2nd Philippic,
at which time he was sixty-two. ‘⁴ Defendi
Rempublicam adolescens non deseram se-
nex’' (Phil. ii. 46). But the reader will
find many examples in Forcellini, under the
articles‘ adolescens’ and ‘ juvenis. ’

43. patiens vocari] AGraecism. “Patiar-
que vel inconsultus haberiss’ Epp.i.5. 15.
“Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari’

(Epp. i. 16. 30).

44. Caesaris auom]
gent scholar and candid man, declares him-
self perfectly unable to account for this
language of Horace. It confounds and
disturbs he says all his notions of Horace's
character (Prosop. p. 277). , See Introduc-
tion to this ode. ‘ Alter ² has been stupidly
proposed to meet these objections.

45. Serus in caelum redeas] Ovid, Met.
xv. 868, sq. :—

“ Tarda sit illa dies et nostro serior aevo
Qua caput Augustum quem temperat
orbe relicto
Accedat caelo.¹’

See also Trist. v. 2. 47. Τ118 adjective for
the adverb is common in respect of time.

The instances in Horace are very nume-
rous.

46. populo Quirini ,·] Some MSS. have
Quin'no. But the genitive is the general
reading, and corresponds more closely to

{llic regular form‘ populus Romanus Quiri-
um!

Estre, a very dili-

49. triumphem] Augustus 11811 511818818-
11181811, 01 was just about to celebrate, three
triumphs on three successive days, for his
victories (l) over the Pannonians and Dal-
matians, (2) at Actium, and (3) at Alex·
andria. ‘Triumphus’ is governed by‘ amesf’
as ‘pocula' is governed by‘ spernit’ (1.1
19); 18 110111 which 88888 we have an 88811-

· 881118 case and an infinitivo mood governed

by the same verb.

y50. pater] The title of‘ pater patriae'
was not assumed by Augustus tin Asuc-
752. Ovid addresses him by that title,
(Fast. ii. 127) :—

u Sancte pater patriae, tibi plebs, 'tibi curia
nomen

Hoc 1181111; hoc dedimus nos tibi nomen
Res ἓξὲξ ante dedit. Sero quoque vera

Nomina : jampridem tu pater orbis eras.
Hoc tu per terras quod in aethere Jupiter
Νξέἆιω 1131188ς hominum tu pater, ille

It was the highest title of honour that
could be confer-red on a citizen, and was
first given by the Senate to Cicero (the
army had formerly bestowed it on Camil-
lus), on the occasion of his suppressing
Catiline's conspiracy. Juv. viii. 243 1-,-·

“ Roma parentem—,
Romgjngatfem patriae Ciceronem libera
5
where ‘libera' seems to mean that the
senate were no longer free agents when

Augustus took the name. See C. iii. 24. .

27, 8.

princepe,] Tac. Anu. i. 1, “ Cuncta dis·
cordiis civilibus fessa principis sub impe-
rium accepit.''

51. equitare inultos] See above, v. 21, 8.

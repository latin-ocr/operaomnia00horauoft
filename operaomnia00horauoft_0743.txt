Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet,

Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus,
Aut in avem Procne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.
Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.
Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu ·

Fabula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi;

Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus
Inciderit ; nec quarta loqui persona laboret.
Actoris partes chorus officiumque virile

186. eoquat etia adarim Atracia] See
c.i.6.8, n.; and as ιο Prome see C.iv.
12. 5, ιι. Short fragments of the Atreus of
Sophocles and Cadmus of Euripides are ex-
tant. 'nne story of Cadmus and his wife
Harmonia changed into serpents is told by
Ovid (Met. iv. 563, sqq.). Such barbarities
and miramlous changes Horace says may
answer iu narration, but if represented on
the stage are both incredible and disgusting.

Ῑιι the tragedy, Medea, attributed to Se-
nem, the mother stranglea her children on
the ιιιιςο,ι ‘notwithstanding the admonition
os Horace, who probably had some similar
mmple of tho Roman theou-e before his
qua, for a Greek would hardly have oom-
nitted this error. The Roman tragediam
must have had a particular rage for novelty
and effect to seek them‘ ιιι such amcitiae''
(Schlegel, Dram. Lit. Lect. xv.). This
author’s estimate of the only Roman tra-
gedies that remain is very low: they are
“beyond description bombmtic and frigid,
unnatural both in eh'aroeter and action, re-
vulfing imm their violation of propriety, and
”meessassfflmffizffiffiss
rhetorioel schools for the stage.'’—“Every
tngical common-place is worried out to the
last gasp; all is phrase, and even the most
common remark is forced and stilted,'' διο.
This is rated criticism, but Horace
had· βυδιωγ a low opinion of the tragic
h he flatters
Varius and Pollio. It is probable, as Schle-
gel say s, Seneea’ s plays were never intended
to be y121eted3 but if so, his remarks above
quoted are not quite consistent. See C.' 1.
θ. 8, ιι.; ii. 1. 10, ιι.; S. i. lo. 42, ιι.

191. nec deus intersit] It was a reproach
to the ’ s that ἐπειδάν τι ἀπορῶσιν,
‘'Llffissssz‘? ”3353 3⁹23}ng ‘³1⁶3' ς 3ᾗί
‘saurgan (Poe't. xv. ll) instanooeptlie oon-
clusion of the Medea of Euripides. The
gods were introduced on a platform above,
Which is the μηχανὴ referred to. Hence
the proverb ¹‘ Deus ex machina’' for any

summaryway of winding upaplot, or ex-
tricating oneself from a difficulty. Cioero
uses the same illustratiou (de Nat. Deor. i.
20). “ut tragici poetae quum explicare
argumenti exitum uon potestis, confugitis
ad deum. '’ Foroellini explains ‘vindice'
by‘ ¹,solutore et quasi liberatore rei adeo
involutae ut ope humana bonus exitus in·
veniri non possit : ” ‘one brought ιιι ιο un-
ravel the knot, and deliver the people from
an otherwise hopeless position!

19-2. nec quarta loqui perrona laboret]
Thespis first introduced a single actor on the
stage, who perhaps told a story and served
to relieve the chorus. Aeschylus inu-oduoed
a second, and so brought regular dialogus
into the drama. Sophocles added a third,
and this number was rarely if ever exceeded
(see Epp. i. 18. 14, n.. and Miiller, Lit.
Gr. p. 304, sqq.). The Romans observed
no such restrictiori, but it must always be
the ease, if more than three actore are on
the stage at once, that some of them mn
have but little to say.

193. Actoris partes chorus] The chorus
shouldsustaininits place and to the best
of itspowerthe part osan actor3 thatis,
instead of singing what is irrelevaixt to the
plot, it ought to ear-ry on the action.

‘officiumque virile defendat' is a way of
exprmsin‘g, ‘it must sustain a strenuom

part,’ or ‘do its duty strenuously! Horace -

uses the expression ‘defendente vioem' in
the same sense (S. i. 10.12). Horaoe’s x
rule was followed by Aeschylus and Sopho-
cloe, but not always byEuripyidee, with whom

“the choral songs have frequently little or
ιιο connexion with the fable, and are no
better than a mere e pisodieal ornament”
Schlegel, Dram. Lit Lect. v.). Aristotle

Poet- xviii. 19) says, τὸν χορὸν δὲ’ ενα δεῖ
υπολαβεῖν τῶν ὑποκριτῶν, καὶ μόριον εἶναι
τοῦ ὅλου, καὶ συναγωνίζεσθαι μὴ ὥσπερ
παρ’ Εὑριπιὸῃ ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ παρὰ Σοφοκλεῖ.
As respects Euripides thoee remarks are not
always true. Some of the chol-uses ιιι his
extant plays are pertinent enough.

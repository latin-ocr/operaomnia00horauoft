EPODON LIBER, l.

An hunc laborem mente laturi decet
Qua ferre non molles viros?

Feremus et te vel per Alpium juga
Inhospitalem et Caucasum,

Vel Occidentis usque ad ultimum sinum
Forti sequemur pectore.

Roges tuum labore quid juvem meo,
Imbellis ac firmus parum?

comes minore sum futurus in metu,
Qui major absentes habet ;

Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis
Serpentium allapsus timet

Magis relictis, non, ut adsit, auxili
Latura plus praesentibus.

Libenter hoc et omne militabitur
Bellum in tuae spem gratiae,

Non ut juvencis illigata pluribus
Aratra nitantur mea,

though the metm suffered. All Orelli's
fierdun-e, which are MSS. of great weight
in his efflmation, are directly or indirectly
in favour of ‘sil Orelli supposes the oon-
atruefion to be eompounded of ‘te super-
aite’ and ‘si superstes mihieris.’ After
voighing the opposite opinion well, 1 prefer
adopting that word which gives the only
regular construction, and which hm abun-
dant MS. authority. Cruquius reads ‘ sit‚'
and notioes no various reading. We may
suppose therefore that the Blandinian MSS.
had that word. But the reading is not free
from doubt. The punctuation by which some
editors try to make the sense plain renders
it hopelessly confused. Doering, for in-
moe, and Mitscherlich point thus :--›
‘⁴ Quid nos? quibus te, vita, si superstite,
Jumnda, si eontra, gravis.”
It would behardto imagine a greaterabuse
of commas.

16. firmus parum 1] This is generally
suppoeedto refer to Horace’s state of health,
which was never good; but 1 think itis only
taken from the Greek ἄναλκις, which goes
oemmonly with ἀπτόλεμος (as Doering
says). In the next line Bentley reads
‘aim ’ on the conjecture of Heinsius, ‘¹ ut
respondeat τῷ juvem‚’' which 1 do not
understand. ‘Sum futurus’ is a direct
ωπον to the supposed question.

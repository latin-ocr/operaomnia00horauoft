HORATII FLAOOI

Nutms argento color est avaris
Abdito terris, inimice lamnae
Crispe Sallusti, nisi temperato

Splendeat usu.

Vivet extento Proculeius aevo 5
Notus in fratres animi paterni3
Illum aget penna metuente solvi

Fama superstes,

Latius regnes avidum domando

Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis

Gadibus jungas et uterque Poenus

Serviat uni.

Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops,

2. Abdita terrim] Lambinus’ conjecture
‘ abditae terris' to agree with ‘lamnae' has
been adopted by many editors, but it has
no MS. authority. I see no other great
objection to it. ⁴ Avaris' Doering under-
stands to be the dative case, ⁴ hidden by the
avaricions in the earth ς’ as S. i. 1. 41 z

⁴‘ Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus
Fui-{iizimdlefossa timidum deponere ᾔει-τογ’

But, besides the confusion this introduces in
the construction, the force of the allusion is
thus lost. Sallustius possessed some valu-
able mines in the Alps, and to this circum-

stance Horace seems tacitly to refer. ’ The
character given of Sallustius by Tacitus
(Anu. iii. 30)
Horace's description. Tacitus says he was
“ diversus a veterum instituto per cultum
et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu
propior :’' on the strength of which some
commentatore have supposed Horace meant
to give him a hint upon his extravagance‚
for which impertinence the great man
would not have thanked him. To bear
out their case they refer ‘nisi temperato’

to the first line. Horace inverts the order
of the cognomen and gentilician name, as
Tacitus frequently does ; as ⁴ Agrippam
Postumum ’ (Ann. i. 3), and elsewhere.
The eleventh ode of this book is addressed
to Quintius Hirpinus3 and the names are
inverted as here.

lamnae] Ovid (Fast. i‘. 207):

‘⁴ Jura dabat populis posito modo consul
Etalgvii-so argenti lamina crimen erat.''

is rather different from ⁸ *git

5. Vwet extento Proculeius aevo] Pro·
culeius is stated by the Scholiasta to have
assisted his brothers Caepio and Murena,
who had lost their property in the civil
war-s. Scipio, asthenamaap inAscen-
sius’ text of the Scholiasta, is a mistake for
Caepio. But it is doubtful’ whether Caspius
whose family name was Fannius, was any
relation of Proculeius Murena whose con-
spiracy he joined (see Introduction), or
whether Murena was Proculeius' brother or
cousin. Proculeius was in
with Augustus and was intimate with
Maecenas (who married his sister οι· cousin
Terentia), and probably with Sallustius.
He was alive at this time, and dianot die
till after Horace, therefore tho reading
which is thatof many oldMSS-is
rejected by most editors. Proculeius'was
like Maecenas a favourer of letters, and is
so referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 94) ε

“ Quis tibi Maecenas quis nune· crit sut > Ξ

Proculeius ?'’

6. Notus—animi] Horace’s adaptatiun

of Greek constructions is one of the chief ,γ’

features of his style. He uses ‘ metuente ’
here in the same sense as in C. iv. 5. 2⁰.

“Culpari metuit Fidesss' ‘wings that refuso
to melt,' as Icarus’ did.

9. Latius reqnes] This iusseri-ed to by ’”

some (see note on v. 2) as showing that
Horace is addressing a lecture to Sallustius.
But he is only speaking generally (see

Argument).

11. uterq ue Poenus] Thismeans (astho -y‘

Scholiasts explain) the Carthaginians ofAfi-ioe
and their colonies' ιιι Spain, not the Planesi-
cians as Graevius says. ‘Uterque pontus'

has been suggested by Schroeder, &cause .
there were not two Poeni. But the above J*

explanation is sufficient.

SATIRARUM H. 4.

Et decedet odor nervis inimicus ; at illa
Integrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem.

Vina columbino limum bene colligit ovo,
Quatenus ima petit volvens aliena vitellus.
Tostis marcentem squillis recreabis et Afra
Potorem cochlea ; nam lactuca innatat acri

Post vinum stomacho ; perna magis ac magis hillis

Flagitat immol-sus refici; quin omnia malit
Quaecunque immundis fervent allata popinis.
Est operae pretium duplicis pernoscere juris

53. odor aer-vis inimicae ,·] This means
what we call the bouquet which helped
the wine in its intoxicating effects upon· the
brain- With the inferior winoe various
aromatics were frequequ introduced for
the purpose of giving them an agrecable
perfume.

58. Thetis marcentem squillk] When
, the guest has got surfeited or drank so
much he cannot digest any more, his appe-
tite is to be tempted with fi-ied shrimps and
snails, of which the best sort came from the
coast of Africa, and were called ‘ solimae?
the derivatim of which name is uncertain,
(see Van-m de R. R. iii. 14, and Pliny ix.
⁵& m. 6): also with bacon and sansagus.
Comm. Cruq. says that ‘hilla ’ is a diminu-
five form of ‘hirat' “et significat intes-
finum salsum, vel ut alii dicunt fartum
salsitiuml' The lettuce, Catius sayS, ought
not to be taken for this purpose, because it
doae not settle on the stomach when it is
irritated. ‘Lactuca’ was commonly eaten
at the ‘ gustatorium ’ as an incentive to the
appetite. Pliny, speaking of the different
species of this plant, says: “Est natura
omnibus refrige rati-ix, et ideo aestate gratae
stomacho fastidium auferunt cibique appe-
tentiam faciunt’' (xix. 38). Catiussay sthe
eloy ed stomach would rather (malit)y have
any coarse dish brought in from the cook-
shop to stimulate it than lettuce after drink-
ing wine, which was a different thing from
taking it before dinner.

61. Ftaqitat immortua refici. ·] ι-Ῑιιι
morsus' agrees with ‘stomachusss and
signifiae stimulated, ⁴,pervulsus’ as‘ ‘qualia
lassum pervellunt stomachum'’ (S. 8. 9).
The older editions nearly all have ‘in
morsus,' as if the meaning was that the
stomach wanted to be recruited for a fresh
attack upon the viands3 but the expression
is not admissible here. Thisreading, which
is that of many MSS„ including all those of

the Royal Library at Paris collated by
Pottier, probably arose out of the word
‘inmorsus‚’ a way of writing the compounds
with ‘ in ’ found in many MSS.

62. immundis ser-vent allata pupinia]
were the lowest sort of
eating-houses, where meat was cooked and
usually caten on the premisoe, but some-
timos sent out. They were the same as the
Greek καπηλεῖα. They were a lower sort
of ‘cauponae’ (see S. i. 5. 2, n.). Their
keepers, ‘popae‚' were, as might be ex-‚
pected, usually persons of no credit (⁴⁴ mi-
rabar enim credi popae,” cie. pro Mil. 24).
ΤΙιθ shops were dirty, and the company
yery low. Compare Epp. i. 14. 21 ε

“Fornix tibi et uncta popina Incutiunt
urbis desiderium! ’' There were great num-
bers of these shops about the city3 whence
Martial says, in speaking of the improve-
ment of the streets (vii. 61):

“Stringitur in densa nec caeca novacula
Octcuussaat aut totas nigra popina vias.
Tonsosigrglqpm coquus, lanius sua limina

Niffipt-§oma ost, olim magna taberna

The ‘popinae’ were called ‘thermopolia’
by Plautus (see Forcell.), because there the
Romans drank hot spiced wine aud water,
‘caldar Bekker (Gallus, 272) says there
was no difference between a ⁴ popina' and
‘thermopolium.'

63. duplicis pernoscere juris] Catius
goes on to describe the saucae, of which
there are two kinds: one which he calls
simple, but which was not entirely so,
being made of sweet olive oil mixed with
rich wine and‘ muria: which is not, as
Comm. Cruq. says, salt water, but‘ garum,
made fromq certain shell-fish (S. 8. 53).
There was a composite sance which was

SATIRARUM 1. 6.

Me possum casu quod te sortitus amicum
Nulla etenim mihi te fors obtulit: optimus olim

Virgilius, post hunc Varius dixere quid essem. ⁷

Ut veni coram singultim pauca locutus,

Infans namque pudor prohibebat plura profari,

Non ego me claro natum patre, non ego circum
’ Me Satureiano vectari rura caballo,

Sed quod eram narro. Respondes ut tuus est mos

60

Pauca: abe03 et revocas nono post mense jubesque

Esse in amicorum numero.

Magnum hoc ego duco

Quod placui tibi qui turpi secernis honestum,
Non patre praeclaro sed vita et pectore puro.

Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis

Mendosa est natura alioqui recta, velut si

Egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos;
Si neque avaritiam neque sordes aut mala lustra

Bentley adopts, once. more ’on the acore of

Non cognosco tuum, Ο Flacce, tam su-

tmen non idoneus qui id diceres; neque
vero ai bene te novimus dicere unquam
voluisti? Most persons will think that this
apostrophe is thrown away, and that there
ia no arrogance in the first person which is
not involved as much in the third. All the
MSS. have the first either in the indicative
ω the subjunctive mood. 1 prefer the
former3 Orelli does not. His detractors
were fond of calling Horace ‘⁶ Fortunae
filius” (S. ii. 6. 49). Bentley is equally
eloquent on the reading ‘ mihi te fors ob-
tulit: which he declares is “quam inscite
et stolide hic dictum ut nihil magis. Quid
enim? an patrono et rege suo Maecenate,
cui vitam, opes, omnia debuit. majorem
hic se gerit coactoris Graeculi filius? Tibi
vero, o Noster, Maecenatem fors obtulerit?
quod sodes ex te verbum audio ? Immo te
Maecenati nisi omnium quotcunque fuerunt,
sunt. eruntve Suffenorum primus es.'’
‘Tibi me’ he found in one MS„ and so
Cruquius’ Scholiast seems to have read the
passage. But there is perhaps more mo-
dosty and feeling in the poet’s sayiug that
his fortune or his friends presented him
with a kind and powerful patron, than that
hc was thrown in the way of the great man.

'l'he MSS„ with the above exception, have
all ⁴ mihi te,’ and the common sense of all
the editors 1 have seen but Cunningham
and Sanadon has disregarded Bentley's
tir-ade.

55. Πνῃίῖὲω, poet hune Varius] See
S. 5. 40, n.

59. Satureiano] A fine horse bred in
the pastures of Saturium in Calabria, near
Tarentum, according to Servius on Georg. ii.
197. The Scholiaet Porphyrion says it was
a place in Apulia. The lengthening of the
antepenult is required by the metre- Others
explain Saturi Tarenti in the above passage
of Virgil from Saturus being a divinity par-
ticularly worshipped by the Tarentines.
(Cic. in Verr. ii. 460.) This would make
‘ Sat. caballo ' merely a Tarentine horse.

64. ced vita et pectore parm] ‘ Not as
being the son of a distinguished father, but
because my life and beart were pure.’ So 1
understand the words. Orelli says this in-
terpretation is ‘⁴ prorsus imperim? and
applies ‘ vita et pectore puro' to the father,
‘ as born of a father not distinguished, but
of life and beart pure.' 1 do not think
Maecenas considered what was the charac-
ter of Horace's· father, but what was his
own.

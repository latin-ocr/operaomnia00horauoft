ARGUMENT.

My prayers are auswered, Lyce. Thou'rt old and wouldst captivate still ς but love abides
only on the froeh cheek, aud runs away from the withered trunk, and from thee, with
thy blnck teeth, and wrinklae, and grey hairs. Try and hide thine years with purple
and jevels, but the tell-mle recorda betray thee. Where is the girl that 1 loved only

next to Cinara? whom fate carried off too soon, while it lest Lyce to grow old, that
her lovm might laugh at her decline.

Anmvnmaz, Lyce, di mea vota, di
Audivere, Lyce: fis anus, et tamen
Vis formosa videri
Ludisque et bibis impudens
Et cantu tremulo pota Cupidinem 5
Lentum sollicitas. Ille virentis et
Doctae psallere Chiae

Pulchris excubat in genis.

ιο munh bitterness and derision expraesed laesness than design, may be doubted. Its
iu the mere verbal composition of this ode tone however is sufficiently taunting, and
ns Dilleubr. has discovered, or whether, for it may easily be believed that more thau
inmune, the cncophony of the first scanza one person may have been smng by it.

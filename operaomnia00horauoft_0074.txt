44 HORATII FLAGGI

CARMEN XVII.

It may entertain the reader to know that a treatise was once written on the subject of
Horace’s Tyndaris, in which it was proved to the satisfaction of the writer that she was
a freedwoman of Rhaemetalces, king of Thrace, that she is the person Horace elsewhere
speaks of as Thressa Chloe, Sidonia Chloe, and Venus Marina; also that she was a
poetess. It being assumed that the last'ode was addressed to Tyndaris, according to the
common inscriptions, it is supposed by many that the lovers had made up their qnarrel,
and that Horace here proposes a meeting to seal their reconciliation. All this which is
plainly unreasonable should be put aside by any who wish to understand Horace. There
is no connexion between the two odes, except that the title, which belongs to this, has
been borrowed for the other, and there is no reason to suppose that Horace, writing at
his farm, had any other than an imaginary Tyndaris, with an imaginary Cyrus, in his
mind.

ARGUMENT.

Tyndaris, osten doth Pan leave Lycaeus to visit Lucretile, protecfing my flocks from
sun and wind3 my goats go unharmed and fear not snake or wolf when his sweet pipo
sounds in the vale of Ustica. The gods love me for my piety and my muse. Here
Plenty awaits thee3 here shalt thou retire from the heat and sing of the loves of Pem-
lope and Circe for Ulysses. Here thou shalt quaff mild Lesbian in the shade, nor shall
strife be mingled with the cup, nor shalt thou fear the jedous Cyrus, lest he lay his
violent hand upon thee. .

VELox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam
Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventos.
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos 5
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti,

Nec virides metuunt colubras
Nec Martiales Haediliae lupos,

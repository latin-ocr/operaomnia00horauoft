Q. HORATII FLAccl

CARMEN SECULARE.

Wmffl Augustus had completed the period of ten years for which the imperial power
was at first placed in his hands (Am-c. 727—737)‚ he determined to celebrate his suc-
cemes athome and abroad by an extraordinary festival, and he took as his model the
Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which had in former times been observed as a means of propi-
tiating the infernal deifioe, Dis aud Proserpina, on occasions of great public calamities.
It does not appear that this festival ever was held at regular intervals. How therefore
themmeLudi Secularesaroseisnotclear: butasitwasnowfor the first time given it
was probably convenient to have it believed that the games were no more than the
obem-vauca of a periodieal solemnity. The Quindecimviri were ordered to consult the
Sbynim books, and they reported, no doubt as they were deaired, that the time was
come whm this great national festival should be repeated, and the details of it were
laid down as from the commanda of the oracle in a set of hexameter Greek verses,
composed of course for the ocoesion, and which have been preserved to us by the
histor-im Zosimus, whose account of the festivalis transcribed' m the article Ludi Secu-
lares iu Smith’s Dict. Ant„ and need not be repeated here. The versas may help the
ruder, and they will be found at the end of the ode.

Since Dis and Proserpina were the divinities chiefly invoked in the ancient gamen, the
question arisoe, Why were Apollo and Diana the leading deitiae on this occasion ἓ If it be
admioeed thatthe festival was observed as a matter of convenience and not from auy
religious feeling, it is not difficult to understand that the older precedents were only
generally adopted, and the deitiea most in fashion were as a matter of course substituted
for the obsolete Dis and Proserpina. Augustus considered himself especially under the
protection of Apollo, and the attributas assigned in the olden time to the infernal deities,
as the originators and avertere of physical evils, had by this time been transferred to
Apollo and his sister as representing the sun and moon, as Mitscherlich has oboerved.
Orelli on this point quotes with approval some remarks of Jahn on Virg. Eel. iv. 10 to
this effect: that a notion commonly existed among the Greeks, aud also among the
Eis-uacans and Romans, that the universe was moving in a cycle the completion of which
would measure one great year of the world; that this year was divided into 10 months
or ages (saecula), the length of which was not defined but was declared from time to
time, as they were completed, hy prodigies sent from heaven. This-accounts for the irre-
gular celebration of the Secular gamas at Rome. The Sibylline books, he goes on to
say, declared which divinity especially presided over each mouth; Satura pres-idea over
the first and Apollo the last, Diana over the last but one, as iu the civil year she claimed
November as her own particular month. This is the reason why these divinitioe were
worshipped rather than others, because on the appearance of the comet at the death of
Julius Caesar it was announced by the soothsayer Volcatius that the ninth (Diana’s)
mouth was passing away and the tenth was theu beginning. This account evidently has

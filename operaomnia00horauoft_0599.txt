ne me who suppose that Horace wrote this Epistle to console Tibullus, and to ehide
him flor being melancholy, referring to v. 12, which, as Orelli says, contains nothing more
unm ι gener-d description of human life. The description {1012oe givoe of Tibullus’
person is confirmed bysn old biography, which mus him ‘⁴ equae Romanus insignis forma

battle of Aetium. he aeoompnnied Messalla into Gaul and m absent about s year, which
a su· m we know oomprised ull his nenive life, though Dissen has endeavoured to show
unt for ten yeus, from ΛΑΜ). 712 to 722, he served in the army. Horace among other
blessings assigna him good hedth3 nevertheless he died young. It appears that while
many dispar-god Horaee's writings 'libullus judged them ldndly, and the affection the
two poets bore one another cannot be mistaken. Tibullus was probably ten or twelve
years younger-than Horaoe. Vurious attempts have been made to give a date to the
Epistle, but none are satisfactory to my mind. Tibullus died the sume year with V'ngil
(Anno. 734), or very soon aster. Ovid seems to imply that he first eume into notioe
whenAugustuswas made emperor, Amne 727 (Tristii. 463, sq.),‘ ‘legit-nque 'Rbullus
Etplaoet et jsmte principe notus erat.” Andso theEpistle is plnoed between these
twodates. Anythingnenreroennotbearrivedst, andthisisunoertain.

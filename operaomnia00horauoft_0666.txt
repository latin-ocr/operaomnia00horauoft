636 HORATII FLACCI

EPISTLE XVIII.

Here we have some more advice to a young man beginninglife, as to how he should win
the favour of the great. The person addressed is young Lollius, respecting whom see the
Introduction to Epp. 2 of this book, which is also addressed ιο him. Though a distinc-
“ ι1011 is drawn between vulgar flattery and refined, and the first is condemned, which in this
case could scarcely be necessary, it would be hard to imagine any thing more degrading to
a fine and independent mind than the arts by which this young man is taught to riso.
It seems as if Horace thought there was danger of his being foolish enough to prefer his
books or his recreations or intellectual privacy to the boisterous tastes or varyingv humours
of a patron‚-a folly of which he must by no means be guilty. He was of an ingenuom
disposition if there is any meaning in the first verse3 but he was to school his tongue
and his manners to a refined servifity, and to consider this act a virtue. That Horace
was himself tired of the life he recommends, we may infer from the closing verses. It
would have been more manly if he had held up his experience in the way of warning tor
the young man that he should avoid these dangerous and ditty waters. But Horace's
was not a vigorous mind, but amiable, and iu the small ways of the world sagacious to
perceiye but not prompt to act. ' Ι “

The date is generally assumed to be A.n.c. 734, the year in which the standards were
restored by the Parthians. This depends partly on the accur-acy of the reading in v. 56,
where see note. g

ARGUMENT.

Unles‘s I am mistaken in you, my frank Lollius, you are not the person to act tho
parasite under the garb of a friend. There is as much difference between the two as
between a chaste matron and a harlot. But even a greater fault than this is an affecta-
tion of roughness which calls itself liberty and virtue. Real virtue is a mean between
opposite vices. You shall see one at the rich man's table trembling at his every look,
catching up and echoing his words like a school-boy or second-part actor3 while another
brawls for trifles as one who would not give up a point or have his bawling ‚stoppeth
no, not if you'd give him his life over again.

(v. 21.) Great people have a horror of the man of pleasure, the gambler, the coxcomb,
the covetous, though they may be ten times worse themselves3 or the patron, if he
sees one aping him, will, if he be kind, admonish him, saying, ‘⁴ Ι can afford to be a
little foolish: you cannot.'' Eutrapelus, if he had a spite against any one, would give
him some fine clothes3 for he knew they would change the man's character entirely,
that he would turn idle, profligate, spendthrift, and come to abject poverty in the end.

(v. 37.) You must never be inquisitive about your patron’s secr-ets, or betray them; nor
praise your tastes at the expense of his; nor take to your books when he wants to go out
hunting. On such grounds the brothers Amphion and Zethus quarrelled ; and as the
one yielded ιο ι116 other, so do you yield to your patron’s kind commanda: put away
your books and go with him to the chase, and like him earn your (11111161- by your toil,
as the old Romans did, especially now you are young and swift and strong, admired in
the Campus, and experienced in war under our great commander. Besides you have
no excuse, for you know what manly sports are, you who have practised sham fights at
your father’s place in the country. He who thinks your taste accords with his, will
praise your amusements ιο the skies.

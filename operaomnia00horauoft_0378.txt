HORATII FLAGOI

Usque ad mala citaret, Io Bacche! modo summa

satisfied, preceded the regular meal, and
consisted of things calculated to provoke
the appetite, of which a list is given in the
eighth Satira of the second book, v. 8, sq„
where however eggs are not mentioned.
These things were eaten with a draught of
‘mulsum' (S. ii. 2. 15, n.) sometimes be-
fore they sat down, or even before they
left the bath. So Martial (xii. 19) says,—
“ In thermis sumit lactucas, ova, lacertum.”
See Becker's Gallus, Exc. ‘ The Meals.'

⁴ 7. citaret,10 Bacche!] This use of ‘citare‚'
‘to shout‚' is not common. Forcellini does
not notice this passage, and only quotes
Cic. de Orat. i. 59, “Citare Paeanem aut
Nomionem. '’ Bentley says ‘ citare Io
Bacche' is not Latin, and asks where we
shall meet with such a phrase as ⁴ citare
cantilenam.' He overlooked the above pas-
sage of Cicero. He conjectures and adopts
¹ iteraret,’ quoting C. ii. 19. 12, “ lapsa cavis
iterare mella.” There were convivial songs
among the Greeks to which they gave the
name ἰόβακχοι. Several fragments of such
issnffisseffissiffissss‘ii'ffissssleesse‘ffsseg’ ‘3232132
Poet. Lyr. p. 490, sqq.). The final syllable
in Bacche is lengthened, and should pro-
perly be pronounced as the singer might be
supposed to pronounce it. The caesui-al
place in the verse is not enough to account
for the lengthening of the syllable, as Orelli
says it is. ‘ Ῑο Bacchae ' is found in some
MSS„ being introduced evidently to save
the metre. Such was the cry of the Bac-
chanals in Euripides’ play, v. 576,—

ι’ὠ, κλύετ’ ἐμᾶς κλύετ’ αὐδᾶς,
ὦ βάκχαι, ἰὼ βάκχαι.

The stringe in the tetrachord, from which
the low notes proceeded, were uppermost
as the player held it in his hand, and the
notes of the voice which corresponded with
these are expressed by ‘ summa voce! For
the same reason the high notes would be
those which harmonized with the lowest
of the strings. The ‘summa chorda' was
called in Greek ὑπάτη, and the ‘ ima ’ νήτη.
1 understand ‘ chordis’ to be the dative
case, the litei-al translation being ⁴ that voice
which is the lowest (where for the above

reason those notes are called the lowoet
which we should eall the highest), and that
echoes to the four strings.'

ll. Iunonie sacra sem-ets] This refers
to the ‘canephoroe‚' damsels who carried
the basket of sacred instrumente on their
head at sacrifices. Those of J uno are men-
tioned here ; but the practice was observed
at all sacrifices. A woodcut from an ante-
fixum in the British Museum, representing
two girls oerrying the basket, will be found
with other information in Smith's Dict. Ant.
art. ⁸ Canephoroe! See also cic. in Verr.
ii. 4. 3, Long’s note. cicero (De Off. i. 36)
uses the same illustration, “ ne tarditatibus
utamur ut pomparum ferculis similes esse
videamur.’'

ll. habebat saepe ducentum] Bentley
substitutes ‘ alebat ' for ‘ habebat? but
though ⁸ alere servos ’ and βόσκειν οἰκέτας
are expressions in use, there is no remon
for deserting the MSS. Ten slaves were a
very small household for a rich man, and
Tigellius was rich. In respect to the num-
ber of slaves usual in wealthy houses, which
in primitive times was small, but latter-ly
grew to an extraordinary number·¹ see
Becker’s Gallus Exc. ‘ on the Slave Famiiy!

12. modo reyes atque tetrarchae‚] ‘Modoss
as an adverb of time, signifies ‘nom’ or
some time not far from the present It is
the ablative of ⁴ modus,' ⁶ measure,' and
⁴ modo ' is within measure, and therefore its
sense is confined to limited quantities.
Compare the use of ⁴ modo ¹ and ‘admodum '
in Terence (Hec. iii. 5. 8) ε ‘⁸ Advenis modo?
Pam. Admodum.” ⁴ Are you coming now?
—Just now.’ ‘ Modo ' thus comes tp have ·
the meaning of ‘ nunc,' and to be used in
the same combinatione, as here ‘ nunc reges
—loquens; nunc, sit mihi mensa tripes ’
would have the same meaning; and like-

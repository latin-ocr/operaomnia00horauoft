230 HORATII FLAOOI

Karthagini jam non ego nuntios
Mittam superbos: occidit, oceidit
Spes omnis et fortuna nostri
Nominis Hasdrubale interempto.
Nil Claudiae non perficient manus,
Quas et benigno numine J uppiter
Defendit et curae sagaces
Expediunt per acuta belli.

7), a wing that will not melt. ‘⁴ Culpari me-
tuit fides ’⁹ (C. iv. 5. 20).

65. evenit] Ι am surprised that such
oereful editors as Orelli and Jahn should on
the slenderest authority adopt the barbarous
word ‘ exiet ’ in this place. merely to cor-
respond to the futures ‘ proruet ’ and ‘geretl
There is better authority for the present
tense in those words than for this correc-
tion. Bentley reads ⁴ proruit’ and ⁴ gerit,'
but the best MSS. have the future. Napo-
leon's declaration that the English were too

dull to know when they were beaten was
only a repetition of Hannibal’s complaiut.

73. perficient] Thero aeems to be more
authority for the future tense than the
present which Bentley adopts, and as a
prophecy in the mouth of an enemy it has
perhaps more weight, and it is more in ac·-
cordance with the preceding constructionsss
‘ Acuta belli’ corresponds, as Turnebus ob-
serves, to Hom. (iv. 352), ὀξὺν 'Apum The
same construction occurs C. iv. 12. 19,
‘⁴ amara curarum.'’

OARMEN V.

A.u.c. 740.

This ode was written after the German victories celebrated in thelast odeand C. 14, md
perhaps sent to Augustus in Gaul A.U.c. 740. What were the reasons for the Emperor-'s
proti-acted absence we cannot tell,·but we need not on that account give credit to the con-
jectures mentioned before (C. iv. 2, Introduction). It was perhaps the policy of Angustus
to make his absence felt, and we may believe that the language of Home, which *bears
much more the impression of real feeling than of flattery, represented the senfiments of
great numbers at Rome, who felt the want of that presiding genius which had brought
the city through its long troubles and given it comparative peace. Thero could not be a
more comprehensive picture of security and rest obtained through the influence of ὀιιο
mind than is represented in this ode, if we except that with which no merely mortni lan-
guage can compare (Isaiah xi. and lxv. Micah iv.). The carmen Saeculnre contains ’
much that is repeated here. Virgil’s description in his fourth Eclogue will naturally
occur to the reader.

ARGUMENT.

Τοο long hast thou left us, our guardiam fulfil thy promise and return as the spring to
gladden our hearts. As the mother for her absent son, so does Rome sigh for her
Caesar. Our fields are at peace, the very sea is at rest, our morals are pure, our women
are chaste, the law is strong, our enemies are silenoed, each man lives in quiet aud
blesses thy name as Greece that of Castor or Hercules. Long mayst thou be ψει-αἱ
to bless us, is our prayer both morning and evenin&

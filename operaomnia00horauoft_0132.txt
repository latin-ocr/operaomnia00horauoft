102 HORATII FLAGGI

ARGUMENT.

Bar-ine, if 1 could see thee punished for thy false vows, 1 might believe thee again. “ But
the moment aster thou hast forswom thyself thou art lovelier and more bright than
ever. Pei-jury then is profitable, Venus and her train laugh at it. Fresh slaves follow
thee, and the old ones cannot leave thy roof ; mothers and stingy fathers and new-
married brides are afraid of thee.

ULLA si juris tibi pejerati

Poena, Barine‚ nocuisset unquam, -

Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
Turpior ungui,

Crederem. Sed tu simul obligasti 5

Perfidum ‘votis caput enitescis

Pulchrior multo, juvenumque prodis
Publica cura.

Expedit matris cineres opertos

Fallere et toto taciturna noctis

Signa cum caelo gelidaque divos
Morte carentes.

Ridet hoc inquam Venus ipsa, rident

Simplices Nymphae, ferus et Cupido

Semper ardentes acuens sagittas
Gote cruenta.

Adde quod pubes tibi crescit omnis,

Servitus crescit nova, nec priores

Impiae tectum dominae relinquunt
Saepe minati.

1. Jurio-pejeratss This expression is not
found elsewhere. It is formed by analogy
from ‘jus jurandum! Acron speaks of a
form ⁴ jus juratum‚’ but that too is not
found in extant writings. Ovid has imitated
the opening of this ode (Amor. m 3.l , sq.) :—

“ Esse deos, i, crede ε fidem jurata fefellit,
Et facies illi quae fuit ante manet,” &Q

Theocritus mentions a pimple on the tip of
the tongue or the nose as a punishment for

Stephens in his Thesaurus (vol. ii. p. 95)
mentions two Greek proverbs tn the same
effect: ἀφροδίσιος ὅρκος οὐκ ἑμποίνιμος,
and τὸν γὰρ γυναικὸς ὅρκον εἰς ὕδωρ γρά-
φω, the latter being probably a verse from
a Greek dramatist. Α

15. Semper ardentes] This seems to be
taken from a picture. Moschus (Id. i.)
says of the wespons of love, πυρὶ πάντα
βέβαπται. ‘Semper' belongs to ‘arden-
tes!

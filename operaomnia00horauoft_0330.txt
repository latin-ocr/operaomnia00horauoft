300 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN XI.

Supposing that Inachia (v. 6) were admitted to be the same as the Inachia of the next
ode (which is very doubtful, for the name is fictitious, and the vperson is most probably
fictitious too), we should be at liberty to say that at least two years elapsed between the
composition of that ode and this ; but as neither contains any certain evidence of its date,
this comparison even then would be of no value for determining when they were written.
Franke compares Sat. ii. 3. 325, where Damasippus charges Horace with ‘⁸ Mille puellarum,
pueromm mille furores,’' with his own excuse for writing so little in this ode, ‘⁴ Amore,
qui me praeter omnes expetit Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere ” (vv. 3, 4); and from
this infers they were written about the same time. But the Satire appears to have been
written at the end of A.o.c. 7213 wherefore he infers the Epode was written in that yearg
which however is not very convincing. I can see nothing in the ode but a specimen of
that species of composition to which Horace first betook himself in imitation of the Greek
amatory writers. The metre is artificial and difficult of adaptation to the Latin language,
and the last that any writer in that language would resort to for the expression of passion,
though in the Greek it is very expressive and tender. Ι do not believe therefore that
this ode can be identified with any precise period of Horace’s life; and to imagine him
deeply in love with some young Lyciscus is quite foreign to the view Ι take of Horsoe’s
love poems. The name Lyciscus is probably formed from Lycus, Alcaeus’ favourite boy
(C. i. 32. 11). “

ARGUMENT. ”

Pettius, Ι am so smitten with the heavy hand of love, who makes me above others his
victim, that I cannot write as I used. ”ris two years since 1 gave up Inachia. Ah!
what a byword was Ι then ! How I sighed in company and poured out my complaints
to thee when wine had opened my heart ! “Has the poor mau's wit no chance against
the rich man’s purse? My wrath is kindled ι Ι cast my modesty and my sighs to the
winds; I will contend with such rivals no mere.'' Thus did Ῑ boast3 but my feet
carried me still to her cruel door. And now boasting that I have no woman to feu,
Lyciscus has caught my heart3 nor can eounsel or raillery deliver me, nor aught but
some new flame.

ΡΕΤΤΙ, nihil me sicut antea juvat
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.

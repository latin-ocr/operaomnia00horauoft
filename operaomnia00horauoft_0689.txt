24. foedera reyum] The cunning way
in which Sex. Tarquinius got possession of
Gaba for his father Tarquimus Superbus is
related by· Livy (1. 53, sq.). Dionysius
Rnhqrn. (iv. 58.) says he had read an ιιι-

nnox sacrificed on the occasion ond hung up

“The strictnoes of their morals and their

northern cnntons, and they preserved it
long aster the virtues of ancient timos had

at Rome from the hearts and
the demeanour of men. The Sabinos were
simple-hearted and honest? The muti-ast
between them aud the men of Rome in his
owutime is described by Horace inC. iii.

26. Pontificum librom] Thitse are men·
fioned by Cicero in the place quoted above.
The college of Pontiffs had books contain-
ing the regulotions by which they were

>‘ guided, and 811 matters pei-mining to their

office, and the worship of the gods, the
genem supervision of which was their prin-
cipul duty. Τ1ιο original books were, ac-

cording to tradition. given to them by Numa
st their first oeeation3 but they were added
to from time to time, and they must have
been numerous when Horace wrote. Some
parts were no doubt very antiqusted in ex-
pressiori and ideas.

w. annom volumina votnm] Suetonius
says of Augustus (c. 31) that aster he be-
came Pontifex Maximus, “ quicquid fufidi-
corum librorum Graeci latinique generis,
nullis vel idoneis auctoribus vulgo
serebatur, supra dno millia contacta undi-
que cremvit3 ac solos retinuit Sibyllinos.
hos quoque delectu hnbito3 condiditque
dnobus forulis auratis sub Pnl’stini Apollinis
basi.'’ Augustus tusdid not sucffld to the
above office till aster the denth of Lep
in Amo. 741. Porphyrion explains the

‘volumina' as those‘ ‘veteris Mutii vatis,
aut Sibyllae? Τ1ιο · csrmina’ of Mardus,
or the Marcii, were old ' ⁰ in a pro-
phetic suain and half metrica} form, of
which Livy hns quoted two specimens (xxv. ,
12), but not apparently with all their
archaisms complete. According to Sueto-
nius, Augustus burnt au books of this sort
except the ⁸ Sibyllini libri,' ss they were
called, which were written in Greek. But
Servius (on Aen. vi. 72) says that along
with these books were preserved the poems
of Marcius. Other prophetie books were
kept in the Capitol, such as ‘⁴ the Etrusmn
ffiffi {1833 ξῗῆῗιῗηῖἕῖδῑ ῑῗξῗδῗεῖῗ
and who knows how many others of the
same sort? These were 811 books of fate,
and every Etruscan city seems to have pos-
sessed such” (Niebuhr i. 5o7). Niebuhr
(ἱ. 259, ιι.) thinks that Horace may be allud-
ing to the old historical lnys from which the
history of the Roman kings has been forged,
ss well as to propheticnl books like thooe of
the Marcii, which Niebuhr ssys, “in spite
of his contemptuous glauce at them, were
extremely poetical. of thisss’ says he, “ we
may judge even from the passages preserved
by Livy. We must notllet Horace deter-
mine our opinion on these poems any more
than on Plautusl’

27. Dietitet Albano] There is force in

that the Muses themselves had uttered
them (not on Parnassus, but) on the Albm
Mount; that the Muses had changed their
habitati’on to dwell in Latium. Doering

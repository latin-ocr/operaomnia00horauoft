HORATII FLAGOI

ARGUMENT.

Happy is the man who lives 011 1113 farm remote from the troubles of the city and tho
dangers of war and of the sea. He trains his vines, or watches his 1100113, 01 graflzs 1113
trees, or stores his honey, or shears his sheep, or brings offerings of fruit to Priapus
and Silvanus, or lies in the 3118110 or 011 the sost grass where birds are sing-ing and
streams are murmuring3 or hunts the boar, or lays nets for the birds 81111 118103, and
11010111 forgets the pangs of love. Give me 8 0118310 wife who shall care for my home
81111 children, milk my goats, prepare my unbought 111081, 81111 110 dainties shall pleone
me like my country fare, 83 1 sit and watch the kine and oxen and labourers coming
home to their rest at even. So said Alphius the usurer, and determining to live 111
the country he got in all his money, but soon repented, 81111 put it out to usury again.

BEATUS ille qui procul negotiis,
Ut prisca gens mortalium,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,

Solutus omni fenore,

Neque excitatur classico miles truci, 5
Neque horret iratum mare,
Forumque vitat et superba civium

Potentiorum limina.

Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine

Altas maritat populos,

10

Aut in reducta valle mugientium
Prospectat errantes greges,
Inutilesque falce ramos amputans

Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,

1⁵

Aut tondet infirmas oves3

Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,

Certantem et uvam purpurae,

4. Solutus· omni fenore,] Torrentius,
whom Orelli follows, explains this ‘ qui
neque dat neque accipit fenori,' and this
would be its meaning in the mouth of a
city usurer. But the words would equally
suit any other person, and would mean that
in the country 110 would not be subject to
the calls of creditors, and need not get into
debt. The fact is there 810 301110 parts of
the language that do and some that do not
suit the character of Alphius. See Intr.

9. Eryo] This is 811 adverb of empha-
sis, like ὃή, the use of which it is not
to define. Here it expresses a feeling of
pleasure in the contemplation of the soenes
described. In the occupations and amuse-
ments that follow no particular order of

20

seasons is observed‚ but 0110 rem-eaden nster
another is mentioned 83 it occurs, which is 8
111010 poetical way of proceeding than some
editors would adopt, who have altered the
arrangement of the verses to suit the 30830113.

16. infirmas] An ornamental epithet, not
‘sickly,’ as Baxter thinks. His note will
amuse the reader 2-“ Rustici detondent
aegrotantium ov'rum clunes cum ob insueta
affimat& ssffi’et‘ffid :1:33
Vct. Schol.’' The truth of the latter 83-
sertion is doubtful. 1 cannot find any such
notion in the Scholiasts.

17. Vel cum] The commentators quote
Aen. xi. 406: “Vel cum se pavidum oon-
tra 11108 jurgia fingit,” &c., 81111 wagner·-

HORATII FLAGGI

Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,
Ne currente retro funis eat rota.

Non te Penelopen difficilem procis
Tyrrhenus genuit parens.

Ο quamvis neque te munera nec preces

Nec tinctus viola pallor amantium ·

Nec vir Pieria pellice saucius 15
Omvat, supplicibus tuis

Parcas, nec rigida mollior aesculo

Nec Mauris animum mitior anguibus.

Non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae
Caelestis patiens latus. 20

tutes 4 duro ' for 4 puro,' which latter is an
epithet well suited to a clear frosty night.
Again, ‘lumine ' is said by Lambinus to have
existed in some of his MSS. Turnebus once
adopted, but afterwards discarded it. Sm-
liger defends it (Auson. Lect. p. 64), but
Bentley says it arose out of another various
reading ‘ limine' (Canter, Nov. Lect. iv. 2),
from which he draws fresh support for his
reading 4 duro‚' quoting Ovid (Rem. Am.
508), 44 Nec latus in duro limine pone tuum.''
He might have added (Epod. xi. 22), 44 Li-
mina dura quibus lumbos et infregi latus.”
Aristotle (Probl. xxv. 18) answers the ques-
tion, why it is oolder in clear weather than
in cloudy, in a way of his own ι διὰ τί τῆς
αἰθρίας, κ.τ.λ.

10. Ne currente retro funis eat rota]
4 Lest the wheel turn back and the rope with
it,' is Orelli's interpretation, applying ‘retro’
to both ‘ currente’ and ‘ eat.’ Τ118 meta-
phor in that case is taken from a rope wound
round a cylinder, which being allowed to run
back, the rope runs down and the weight or
thing attached goes with it. The application
of the proverb to a eoquette who continues
her pride till she loses her power is obvious.
The passage has caused a good deal of dif-
ficulty, and no two interpreter-s are entirely
agreed as to the meaning of the words. I
see no objection to Orelli's interpretation,

and think it the best of those 1 have seen
Turnebus takes 4 funis' for 4 funalis eqnm,'
and ‘rota' for the chariot·wheel; and he
andei-stands the words to menn, 4 lest the

“Pegasus hic dexter currat tibi3 laevus
Fffl? et ad quartum det tibi Castor
equum.” .

But the proper
4 funalis; quartum ς’ and ‘funis' will hardly
bear this meaning. The ⁸ funalis equus ’ was
one of those which were not under the yoke,
but attached by traces, either as leaders or
by the side of the yoke—horses.

15. Pieria pellice] A Macedonian sta-nm-
pet‚ just as Chloe in the last ode was a
Thracian, and on the same principle. Neai-ly
all Horace’s women of this character ate
represented as Greeks. ‘Curvat’ is no
where else used in this sense.

19. aquae Caelestis] He repente the
phrase (Epp. ii. 1. 135), “Caelestes impio·
rat aquas.'’ There is some intentioml
bathus in this threat of the ‘ luva

goddess. ¹

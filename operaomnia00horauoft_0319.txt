Maius parabo, maius infimdam tibi

Fastidienti poculum,

Priusque caelum sidet inferius mari,

Tellure porrecta super,

Quam non amore sic meo flagres uti
Bitumen atris ignibus. -
Sub haec puer jam non ut ante mollibus

Lenire verbis impias,

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium

Misit Thyesteas preces:

Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent
Convertere humanam vicem ;

Diris agam vos ; dira. detestatio

Nulla expiatur victima.

Quin ubi perire jussus exspiravere
Nocturnus occurram Furor

86. nyoetmpmoe. ·] Curses suchas
Thyestes might have imprecated on the
⁴ head of Atreus. The opening sentence of
the boy's is variously interpreted.
Iambimas proposed, and many scholars
have adopted, the followingversion: namely,

“macha-ast can overthrow the great prin-
ciples of justice, but cannot overthrow (or
clange) the condition οι· fate of men3
whee ‘valent' is understood in the first
danse- In support of the construction are
quoted Tac. Ann- xii. 64: “Agrippina
qnae filio dare imperium, tolerare imperi-
tantem nequibat.” Ib. xiii. 56: “Desste
nobis terrain qna vivamus, in qua moriamur
non potest? and Plaut. Amphit. i. l. 300:
“ Tuae si quid vis nuntiare (sub. sinam) hane
nostram adhuc ιιοιι sinam? which no doubt
exactly represent the ease as these inter-

view it. But 1 do not see the sense
which by this construction is brought out of
Horace’s words. Orelli makes ‘fas ne·
sasque' the subject, and supposes the boy
to say that appeals to justice and the laws

” of Heaven are of no availto turn the course

of witchcrafl: (or the hearts of witchoe); so
hereeorts ιο cnrses. ΤΙιο words‘ humanam
vioem’ he renders‘ more modoque homi·
num, 'which he explains by‘ humanis sensi-
bus! But what he means is not clear. It
would be better if this view of the construc-
tion were adopted ιο render ‘ humanam
vicem’‘ on behalf of men, ’ or ‘of humanity,’
as(cic. Epp. ad Fam. i. 9)‘ ‘nostram vioem
ullas est ipse sese! '(‘See Epod

lentus) as F'ea says, but which Dillenbr.
says cannot be. Bentley acknowledges he
ean make nothing of the sentence ; and, as
the corrections he suggests do not please
himself, they need not be repeated here.
The Scholiasts throw no light upon the ’
subject with their explanatione, and 1 feel
very doubtful about the meaning. The
words may be translated as they stand:
“Witchcraft or the great powers of right
and wrong cannot change the fate of men ;”
i. e. nothing can, whether it be good or bad 3
and though that interpretation does not
satisfy me, 1 prefer it to the others, because
it is the least strained with reference to the
collocation of the words. The omission of
a copula between ‘venena' and ⁸ magnum’
is no argument against this version. The
only other explanation that coincidae at au
with the order of the words is that which
makoe ‘ magnum fas nefasque ’ an exclama-
tion: “ Witchcraft, by the mighty laws of
heaven! cannot change the destiny of man.”
To this interpretation Orelli pays no more
attention than ιο say “prorsus imperite
nuper interpres quidam fas nefuque pro
mera exclamatione habuit.” It had oo-
curred to me as a possible solution of the
difficulty3 and, notwithstanding Orelli’s
opinion, 1 think it may take its place among
the more plausible of the many explanations
that have been offered. Orelli has given
every other that has been suggested, in his
excursus on the passage.

all the MSS. and editions, and the Scholiasts
had that word, which is less likely to have
been invented than the other. When
Bentley tries to support his position by
separating ‘ opprobriis ' from ⁸ dignum, '
and taking it with ‘laceraverit,' leaving
‘dignum’ to stand alone, he only shows
his own weakness. ‘Latro' is used as a
transitive verb in Epod. v. 58, and Epp. i.
2. 66, and therefore it may be here, which
Bentley does not deny.

Cruq. was as perplexed with this expression
as modern commentators. He says ‘⁴ vel
subsellia; vel leges ΧΠ tabularum3 vel
judices non erunt in eum severi.'’ Acron
explains ‘ tabulae ' by ⁴ subsellia: by which
he means that the benches of the judices
would split with their laughter if an action
were brought in such a case, like that ex-

lectore communest The second of the
above explanations (⁴⁶ leges 111 tabula-
rum'’) is adopted by Doering, Dillenbr.,
and Zeuni. Lambinus inclines to the
same, or thinks ‘tabulae ’ may be put for
the judices, as representing the laws.
Orelli takes ‘ tabulae' for the ‘tabellae
judiciariae,' the voting tablets, referring to
the sentence quoted above (on v. 79) from
Cic. de Orat. The general meaning is clear
enough, that the matter will be treated as
unworthy of serious considentium the
judices will laugh at the joke and aequit
the defendant. I think with Orelli that the
‘tabulae' are the tablets by which they
declared their votes, and that Trebatius is
meant to say that the votes of the judices
will be decided by the amusement of the
scene, or else that the severity of their
votes will be melted by the fun.

SATIRE II.

of Ofella, the person into whose mouth Horace puts the chief part of the pronepes
contained in this Satire, we know no more than we may gather from the Satira inoff,
that in Horace's youth he was the owner of an estate near Venusia, and that his property
was taken stom him and made over to one of the veteran soldiers named Umbrenus (v.
133), and that he afterwards rentcd, as ‘ oolonus,’ a farm on that estate which was once
his own. This transfer took place in all probability when the troops returned to Italy
after the battle of Philippi, A.v.c. 712, at which time (among several other districts) the
Venusinus ager was distributed among the soldiers. It has been supposed that Horace
visited his native place, and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella, on his return from
Brundusium (see Introduction to S. i. 5, sub fin.). The old man, unchanged by tho
reverses os fortune, industrious and uncomplaining, exhorting his sons to frngality and
contentment, is a pleasant picture, and helps by contrast to illustrate the gluttonum and
luxurious habits of the city, which, though they had not yet reached the height they came
to under the training of Apicius (“ qui in ea urbe ex qua aliquando philosophi ut corrup-
tores juventutis abire jussi sunt, scientiam popinae professus disciplina sua seculum infecitl’
Seu. Cons. ad Helv. 10), were already very bad. As political activity grew dangerous
and diminished, and wealth poured into the city through the increase of commerce and
the pillaging of provinces, sensual indulgence grew rapidly. Business ceased and dining
began at what we should consider an early hour ; and comparatively few of the Romans
being men of Hterary habits, the rich now passed most of their evenings over the table,
which was furnished with delicacies and ornaments at an enormous expense. The art of

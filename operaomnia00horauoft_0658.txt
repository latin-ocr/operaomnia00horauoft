HORATII FLAOGI

Quandocunque deos vel porco vel bove placat,

on Aen. i. 294, “ Furor impius intus Saeva
sedens super arma,'' says “ in fora Augusti
introeuntibus ad sinistram fuit Bellum pic-
tum et Furor sedens super arma, aeneis
vinctus, eo habitu quo poeta dixit.'’ It was
partially destroyed by fire, and restored by
Hadrian. Other ‘ fora’ were afterwards
erected by different emperors (Nerva, Trajan,
Vespasian). But in Martial's time there
were but three in which judicial business
was transacted (iii. 38)=

“Causas, inquis, agam Cicerone disertius
Atgdgerit in triplici par mihi nemo
oro.

In every ‘ forum ' there was a ⁴ basilica '
(or more than one), a building devoted to
the joint purposes of judicial and com-
mercial business. At the end of the build-
ing was a part called ⁴ tribunal,’ devoted to
law (for which the early ones were exclu-
sively intended); and in a later ‘ basilica'
(that of Trajan) there was a ‘ tribunal ' at
each end. (See Dict. Ant.) There was in
the Forum Romanum the Basilica Porcia,
erected by M. Porcius Cato when he was
consul, A.U.c. 542. Plutarch mentions its
erection in his life of Cato the Censor
(c. 19), and in that of Cato of Utica (c. 5)
118 says that here the tribunes did their
business, and here Cato first distinguished
himself as a speaker. There were also two
Basilicae Aemiliae erected or restored by
Aemilius Paulus. Julius Caesar built one
called after him J ulia. This is referred to
in the inscription above quoted, which
places it between the temples of Saturnus
and Cast0r3 but the positions of these are
doubtful. Here the ‘centumviri ’ held their
court. (See S. i. 9. 35, 11.) L. Opimius,
who was consul, ΛΑΜ). 633, built 8 basilica,
and called it after himself3 and Augustus
built one in honour of his grandsons, Lu*
cius and Caius, probably in his own Forum
(Sueton. Aug. c. 29). Others were built
in the course of time.

58. vel porco vel bove] The animals
most commonly sacrificed by the Romans
were sheep, pigs, and oxen. On public oc-
casions these three were sacrificed together,
and the sacrifice was called ⁴ suovetaurilia,’
being a combination of the three names.
Such a sacrifice is represented on one of the
four paneis on Constantine's arch, of which
an engraving is given in p. 884 of the Dict.

Ant. Private persons would only sam-ifioe
the three on great occasions, and on some
there would be several of each or any of
them offered together. Ordinarily they
sacrificed but one, according to their means
or their zeal.

59. June pater J] See S. ii. 6. 2⁰, 11.
This soene is imitated with much power by
Persius (ii. 5, sqq.). ovid has a similar
soene (Fast. v. 671, sqq.), where he intro-
duces a mercator praying to Mei-cury to
help him to cheat successfully, and to give
him delight in cheating :—

⁴⁴ Da modo lucra mihi, da facto gaudia
Etllil'gdg: ut emtori verba dedisse ju-
vet.'' (v. 689, sq.)

Silent devotion was not practised or under-
stood by the ancients, any more than it is
by the heathen or Mahomedans now: μετὰ
φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι δεῖ is reported to have
been a saying of Pythagoras. Silent prayers
were supposed to be a veil either for im-
proper petitions, or magical incantatione, or
something wrong. To speak with men as if
the gods were listening, and with the gods
so as meu might over-hear, is a rule found
in more than one writer (Senec. Ep. lo.
Macrob. Saturn. l. i. c. 7). See Ruperti
on Juv. vi. 539. See also the above pas·-
sage of Persius, in which he says, ‘⁶ at bona
pars hominum tacita libavit acerra';” and
S. v. 184, “ Labra moves tacitus.” A Hin-
doo, seeing nothing of the Christian’s devo-
tions, believes he practises none3 and if you
speak to him of your private prayers, he
smiles incredulously.

60. Pulchra Laverna,] Laverna was a
goddess associated with Mercury as the god
who presided over thieving. According ω
Comm. Cruq. she had a grove dedicated to
her on the Via Salaria, which led from
Rome through the Sabine country to the
coast. But on what part of this νοω the
grove lay we are not informed. Τ118 deri·
vation of the word is uncertain. The same
Scholiast derives it from ‘laterez’ ‘⁴ Nam
fures olim et latemiones et laverniones di-
cebantur.” Acron derives it from ⁴ lavare ε’
“ Nam fures lavatores dicuntur,'' alluding
to the λωποδύται, I suppose, those who
stole the clothes of bathers. Vossius (Ety-
molog. v. Laverniones‚ p. 282) thinks
Acron wrote ⁴ levatores) and that the word
is from ‘levat-ex as we say ‘shop—lifting!

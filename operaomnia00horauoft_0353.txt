has anigned them; disappointment with the position many yeus’ labom· and perhaps
dishoneety have gained them3 envy of thm‘r neighbours' dmmstancoe, even if they
voreethan their οπως dissatisfaetion in shortvvith what they haveandare, and craving
for something they have not and are nou-these are ἠοῖαι-ω common to the great ma·
jority of men. For this vice of discontent the Greeks had the comprehensive name
μεμψιμοιρία. lt affords a vide field for satire, and could only be touched lightly, or in

astu· proponnding the whole subject in the shape of a quaefion ω Maecenas, Horace
cimfinea himself to one solution of it, and that, it must be admitted, not the most com·
prehensive (see notes cn vv. 28. 108). Nor has he managed the connexion between his
question and the only answer he gives it with very great skill- Avatice is the only reason

ever, when he is upon this subject he writes, as he almost always does, with elegance and
truth, and this is among the most popular of Horace’s Satires.

The chronologists extract a date stom the verses 114, 115:

‘⁴ Ut, quum carceribus missosrapit ungula currus,
Instat equis auriga snos vincentibus, ’¹

Thoeevmoenoraoeis said ω have imitatem endas this Georgic is supposed ω have

by both poeta from some common original, as Orelli suggests. 'l'he likenese is not great.

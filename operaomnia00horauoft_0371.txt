36. Cupiennius] This person is identi-
fied by the Scholiasts with one C. Cupien-
nius hibo of Cumae, a favourite of Augustus,
without any probability. The name, ac-
cording to them, and in the old editions,
was Cupennius. Lambinus and most edi-
ton-s after him have Cupiennius. As to
‘ albi: aee v. 63, n.

38. Qui moechos non nultra] Most of
the MSS. and editions have the dative
‘moechis.’ But the accusative is found in
the following verses of Ennius, quoted by
the Scholiasts, from which these are closely
imitated :—

“ Audire ost operae pretium procedere recte
Qu'iurletirginRomanam Latiumque augescere

46. Jure omnes ; Galba neqabat] ⁶ Every
one else said they richly deserved it: Galba
said nay.’ This person, whom the Scho-
liasts call a ‘jurisconsultum' is by most
modern interpretem, following Torrentius
(to whom Weichert, quoted by Orelli as
the author of the notion, was indebted for
it). identified with A. Galba, a parasite of
Augustus of loose character, of whom Plu-
tarch tells a well-known anecdote in regan-d
to Maecenas' partiality for his wife (Erot.
ο. 16). Having little regard for his own
honour as a husband, he thought, Horace
says, that the retribution described in the

Verum hoc se amplectitur uno,

preoediug verses was more than the crime
desei-ved. This man is apparently the
Galba mentioned by Juvenal (S. v. 3 sq)

“Si potes illa pati quae nec Sarmentus

&aad mensas nec vilis Galbatulis-
The name therefore seems to have become
proverbial.

47. classe secundm] Servius Tullius
divided the men into classes, and Horace
doae the same with the women, as Torren-
tius says. He is wrong however in refer-
ring ‘ tutior ' to the legal consequencae of
adultery arising out of the ‘ lex Julia de
adulteriis,¹ which was not in existence when
this Satire was written.

48. Sallustius in quas] On Sallustius
Crispus, see C. ii. 2. What Horace says of
him is this: If he chose to be liberal to
that extent that his means and good sense
would suggest, without any extravagant
munificence, he might give to the needy
and not injure or disgrace himself, that is,
he would gain credit by it3 whereas he is
content to pride himself on this one merit,
that he does not meddlo with married
women. ‘ Hoe’ (v. 54) is ⁸ on this aocount,’
andb‘se' is g‘overned byeachof thethree

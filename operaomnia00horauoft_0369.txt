Of these the firstis the only historica! name,
having been the surname, according to
Justin (xxxviii. 3), os Manlius, who went
as ambassador to Mithridates. This is of
great importance, for Horace did not
confine himselfto real namoe, though Mad-
iane-hstias: suffles
it. The Scholiasts had Malthinus, which
is Heindorf's reading. Judging from Fea's
list and Bentley’s assertion, the majority
of MSS. have Malchinus. 'ssiat is the read-
ing of Ven. (1483) and nearly allthe earliest
editions. Bentley adopts it against Mal-
thinus, which was the common reading at
that time. He derivoe it from Malchus,
which was an eastern name, or a corruption
of one. ΤΙιθ Scholiasts unanimously say
that the name is derived from μαλθακόςΞ
and that Horace alludes to Maecenas be·-
cause he was said to wear his tunic long, a
sign of effeminacy as it was generally re-
garded 3 but in his case it was, says Acron,
to hide varicose veins with which he was
troubled. Thu Maecenas was spoken of
as effeminate in his habits is sufficiently
well known, and the circumstance of his
wearing long tunics' rs mentioned by Seneca
(Ep. cxiv. ξ 6):· ‘Hunc esse qui solutis
tunicis in urbe semper incesserit? nam
etiam quum absentis caesaris partibus fun-
geretur signum a discincto petebatur ;” and
hythe unknown author of the elegy on his
death :—

“Quod discinctus eras animo quoque, car-
pitur unum,
Diluitur nimia simplicitate tua.
Sic illi vixere quibus fuit aurea virgo,
Quae bene praecinctos postmodo pulsa

21. Beatus Fannius] This isa doubtful
passage. This Fannius is spoken of in
another place (S. i. 10. 80) as a contemptible
person and a parasite of Hermogenes Tigel—
lius (S. 3. 129, ιι..) What the Scholiasta
say os him' is this: that he had the cogno·
menQuadratus: thathewas a poetsullof
words and folly, ·that the Senate made him
a present of some ‘ capsae' (book-boxes)
and a bust of himself; that when he was
dying he desired his books and book-cases
to be burnt publicly; otherwise, that he
was a writer of Satire, and childless, and
that certain persons, hoping to be remem-
beredinhiswill got hisbusts andhis
books depos! 'ted in the public libraries, to
which honour his own merits did not entitle
them. Wherever all this oeme from, it is of
ιιο value at all for determiniug Horace’s
meaning in this passage. Lambinus follows
the Scholissts so far as to suppose that
Fannius was honoured by a spontaneous
present (‘ultro:' see C. iv. 4. 51, n.) on
the part of the “populus sive senatus”
of a set of book-boxes and a bust, as a
mark of public respect. And Turnebus
says, ‘⁸ Fannium nescio quem poetam cujus
libros Romani et armario et capsa, ipsum
imagine donarant, prae se felicem praedicatl’
But who ever heard of such a thing? and
who was this Fannius that he should have
been thus distinguished? It appears pro·
bable, from Horace's words, that Fannius
had his admirers, as rant and emptiness
will always have, and that they made him a
present, by way of a testimonial as it is
called, of a set of haudsome ⁴ capsae ' and a
bust. Τ1ιθ ⁴ eapsa’ was a round box suited
to hold one or more rolled volumes. The
larger sort was called ‘scriniuml (See
Smith’s Dict. Ant.) Neither ¹ capsae ' nor
‘affinia' are to be eonfounded with ‘ar-
maria,¹ which were cu pboards, not boxes,
but also used for books, though not con-
fined to that purpose any more than

‘capsae' were. What the Scholiasts say
about Faunius' bust having been placed in

sistent with usage. Asinius Pollio built a
library Α. ιι. c. 715, or thereabouts, and
placed in it portraioe and busts of various
distinguished men, and the 'ce was
thencesorward observed not only in the
public libraries, but in those os private
ns. Martial, writiug to his friend
Avitus, sends him an inscription for his own
bust, which Avitus was going to put with
others in his library z
“Hoc tibi sub nostra breve carmen imagin* e
vivat,
Quam non obscuris· jungis, Avite,
viris.” (ix. 1.)

23. volyo recitare timentis] See note
on v. 73. The usage which leaves the per-
sonal pronoun to be inferred from the pos-
ses-ive is common both in Greek and
Latin. (SeeC. iii. 22. 6.) Compare
Arist. Plut. 33· .

τὸν ἐμὸν μὲν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ταλαιπώρου σχεδὸν
ἤδη νομίζων ἐκτετοξεῦσθαι βίον,

and Ovid (Heroid. v. 45): “Et flesti, et
nostros vidisti flentis ocellos. ’' ‘’Timeo
and ‘'metuo do not govern an infinitiva
mood in the prose writings of Horace's
day. ‘’Vereor is used ιιι that construction.
Torrentius asks why Horace' s works should
not be read because he was afraid to recite
them in public? Was it because the multi-
tude follow popular applause which rs drawn
forth by public display? The reason Ho-
race givos is the same that deters him from
reciting his poems, that no one likae to see
any more than to hear his own vioes ex·
posed. People are not at all fond of‘ genus
hoc: this satirical sort of writing, because
most are open to blame. He basg particular
classes, or persons perhaps,‘ ιιι his eye, when
he says ‘sunt quos ’.(C i. 1. 3, ιι. ); but he
speaks otherwise generally. That Horace
wrote many pieces which have not been
preserved, appears to me clear from this
passage and v. 71, sqq. See Introduction.

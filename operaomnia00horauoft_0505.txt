166. barathrone] The Sdzoliasts, MSS„

Acron reads ‘ Balsa-oue) and explains it as
the name of a ‘sum-a mptusss the usual
desoeiption of indifferent &meta-s not
otherwise known. Porphyrionhasthenme,

but notiees‘ barathro’ asavarious reading3
and Comm. bas this word, from
which he says is derived the name, which
he spells Barathro. (See note on S.i. 2.
2.) All Orelli’s MSS. have ‘barnthronef
and he adopts that word, which he explains
as some deep pit, such as malefactors were
tbi-own into at Athens and lacedaemon.
An the editions fill Bentley have ‘barn-
throne! He edits‘ balanon& not as a

MSS. in its favour, and Fea mentium
others. Fea himself adopts ‘balatrone'

but does not edit. The great preponder-
ance of authority is in favour of‘ bun»-

explanation. Any pit will do. We need
not go to Athens or Sparta.

unknown, except from this passage. He
lived at Canusium, a town of Apulia (see
S. i. 5. 91, ιι..) His propertywasreduced
to two fai-ms, though his ancoetors were
rich. This is Orelli's explanation. The

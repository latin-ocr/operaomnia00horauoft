HORATII FLAGGI

Non, si trecenis, quotquot eunt dies, 5
Amice, places illacrumabilem
Plutona tauris, qui ter amplum
Geryonen Tityonque tristi
Compescit unda, scilicet omnibus

Quicunque terrae munere vescimur,

10

Enaviganda sive reges '
Sive inopes erimus coloni.
Frustra cruento Marte carebimus
Fractisque rauci fluctibus Hadriae,

Frustra per auctumnos nocentem

15

Corporibus metuemus Austrum:
Visendus ater flumine languido
Cocytos errans et Danai genus

Infame damnatusque longi

Sisyphus Aeolides laboris.

6. illacrumabilem] Here this word is
used in an active sense. It is used pas-
sively 111 C. iv. 9. 26: “Omnes illacruma·
biles urgentur! ’' See note on C. i. 3. 32.
It corresponds with Homer' s, ιἈιδης ἀμεί-
λιχος ἠδ’ ἀδάμαστος (11. ix. 158), where
ἀδάμαστος-ιε expressed by‘ indomitae’ (4).
Compare Aristophanes (Ran. 1392), μόνος
θεῶν γάρ “θάνατος οὐ δώρων ἐρᾷ, and
Horace’ s “Orcus—non exorabilis auro'
(Epp.ii.2. 178).

7. ter amplum] ‘Ter' is not merely
intensive as some take it, but expresses the
triple form of the giant. “Quidve tripec-
tora tergemini vis Geryona'i'' (Lucret. v.

33. tristi Compescit unda‚] This· is Vir-
gil' s description (Aen. vi. 438) :—

“ —— tristique palus inamabilis unda
Alligat et novies Styx interfusa coercet,''

which is repeated from Georg. iv. 479.
Sophocles (Electra, 137) calls it πάγκοινον
λίμναν.

10. Quicunque terrae munere ven-imum]
This expresses the words of Homer, ὃς
Θνητός τ’ εἴη και ἔδοι Δημήτερος ἀκτὴν
(11. xiii. 322), οἳ ἀρούρης καρπὸν ἔδουσι
(Il. vi. 142), which last Simonides has
closely imitated in the fragment preserved
in Plato' s Protagoras (8 Bergk).

11. reyes] This is Horace’s usual word
for the rich, as observed on C. i. 4. 14.
‘ colonus ' was the lessee of a farm, the owner
of which was called ⁸ dominus ’ in respect to
that property. ⁴ Reges ’ therefore here are

20

‘dominiss A‘ colonus' mig htbe rich and the
tenant of a large farm; but Horace refers tc
the poorer sort here aiid' ιιι C.' 1. 35. 6. See
Cic. in verr. ii. 3. 5, 22; Long’s notes.

‘Inops ’ he uses sometimes in an extreme,
sometimes in a qualified sense of want, but
more generally the latter, as he doae‘ pau-
per' C. 1118,n. Theopposifionisbetween
high and low, and the difference is one of
position, as in the third ode of this book

(v. 21, sqq.) :—

“Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho

Nil interest an pauper et infima

De gente sub divo moreris,
Victima nil miserantis Orci-’⁹

‘Vrbe small and great are there, a'nd the
servant is free from his master '¹ (Job iii.
19). This seems to express Horace’s mean-
ing·

15. Μῖνα per auctumnos nocentem]
There' is a like passage in S. ii. 6. 18:

“Nec mala me ambitio perdit nec plumbeus .
Auldtliisitdiiusque gravis Libitinae quaestus

acerbael'

Dillenbr. says ‘corporibus’ may be
vei-ned by‘ nocentem’ or ‘lmetuemns 'qt
can only be governed by ‘Knocentem
Horace would not put that participle abso-
lutely for ‘ noxium,' especially with a dative
immediately following and depending on
another word.

19. damnatusque lonyi] This follows
the Greek construction, καταγνωσθεὶς πό-
νου, as observed C. ii. 9. 17, n. Dillenbr.

δῦνε-81 MSS. have ‘duplices,' which
thom editors who adopt it explain of the

to and from Troy ; but they do not
explain what there was in the first to mske
the subject of a poem. ‘Duplioes' is
plainly a mistake, though it appears in the

{naman- ap. Bentley, who proposes ‘re-

8. mam Pelopis donnum] Alluding to
'Varius' tngedy Thym. of which Quin-
fili-n (x. 1. 98) says, “ Varii Thyestes cui-
libet Graecorum comparari potest? It is
probable however the comparison would not
have been fam to the Grecian muse. A
eonspective view of the atrocities of this
unfortunate house, as they are so osten
referred to, may not be out of place
here, or without its moral. Its founder,

θ ” ‘ Tantalus, served up his own son Pelops at

s feast of the gods- Pelops restored to life
murdered Oenomaus his father-in-lsw and

hig own son chrysippus (Thucyd. i. 9).

placed before theirfatherssameul the
children of styestes his brother, who had
previously seduced the wife of Atreus.
Atreus was killed by Aegisthus his nephew
and suppooed son, who also seduced the
wife of his cousin, Agamemnon (the son of
Atreus), who was murdered by the said
wife Cl and she by her son
Orestes, who was pursued to madnoes by
the Erinnyae of his mother: all which events
furnished themoe for the Greek tragediam, -
and were by them varied in their features
as suited their purpose, or according to the
different legends they followed.

ll. laudes] If, as the Scholiasts (on Epp.
i. 16. 27) affirm, Varius wrote a panegyricon
Augustus (Porphyrion calls it ⁸ notisffl'mum
panegyricum ')‚ it is possible Horace means
indireetly to refer to it here.

18. Sectis] Bentley having proposed
with much confidenoe ¹ strictis‚¹ mdadopted
it in his text, asterwards gave wayto die
general opinion of scholam and withdrew
his emendation. See Museum Criticum,
1814. i. p. 194. ¹ Strictis' has a barbarous
air about it. In ‘sectis' there is an agree-
able irony.

19. eive quid urimur] For ‘ quid’ Lam-
binus has ⁸ quod’ on the authority of many
of his MSS. ‘ quod’ signifying ‘beaussa'
⁴ Quid ' is more elegant. The construction
has been noticed before (3. 15).

SATIRARUM 1. 3.

Est opifex solus, sic rex.

Vellunt tibi barbam

Luseivi pueri; quos tu nisi fuste coerces

Urgeris turba circum te stante miserque

Rumperis et latras, magnorum maxime regum.

Ne longum faciam ε dum tu quadrante lavatum ,
’ Rex ibis neque te quisquam stipator ineptum

Praeter Crispinum sectabitur, et mihi dulces

Ignoseent si quid peccaro stultus amici,

Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta. libenter,
Privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.
